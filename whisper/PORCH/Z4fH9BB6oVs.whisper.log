[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.240]   Porchies, hey!
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.440]   How we doing, we doing okay?
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.560]   Doing okay tonight?
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.780]   It is, it's really, really, really good to be here with you.
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.400]   My name is Jimmy and I'm actually a pastor right now
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.000]   at a church on the south side of Dallas,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.840]   but we have so much love for this church
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.240]   and especially for the porch
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.720]   and for David and the whole crew here.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.600]   So thanks for having me today.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.320]   You didn't have a choice, but thank you for it.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.320]   Nonetheless, I'm eager to get into the word with you
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.320]   in this series.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.780]   So if you have a Bible, get it out.
[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.780]   We're gonna be in the book of Luke chapter 18.
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.700]   We got a lot of verses to cover.
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.320]   I'm gonna read it first.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.800]   We're gonna pray and then we're gonna jump into things.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.600]   Does that sound good?
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.600]   Yes, to the four of you, here we go.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.320]   Let me read it.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.040]   Luke chapter 18, starting in verse one.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.200]   "And he told them a parable to the effect
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.660]   that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.880]   He said, 'In a certain city, there was a judge
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.900]   who neither feared God nor respected man.
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.660]   And there was a widow in that city
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.520]   who kept coming to him and saying,
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.840]   "Give me justice against my adversary."
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.560]   For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself,
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.480]   "Though I neither fear God nor respect man,
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.560]   yet because this widow keeps bothering me,
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.880]   I will give her justice so that she will not beat me down
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.780]   by her continual coming."
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.680]   And the Lord said, "Hear what the unrighteous judge says.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.320]   And will not God give justice to his elect
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.880]   who cry to him day and night?
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.560]   Will he delay long over them?
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.960]   I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.020]   Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes,
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.720]   will he find faith on the earth?"
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.480]   He also told them this parable to some
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.280]   who trusted in themselves that they were righteous
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.860]   and treated others with contempt.
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.220]   Two men went up into the temple to pray,
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.040]   one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.700]   The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus,
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.720]   "God, I thank you that I'm not like other men,
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.480]   extortioners, unjust, adulterers,
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.040]   or even like this tax collector.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.360]   I fast twice a week, I give tithes of all that I get,
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.680]   but the tax collector standing far off
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.400]   would not even lift up his eyes to heaven,
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.920]   but beat his breast saying,
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.000]   "God, be merciful to me, a sinner."
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.540]   I tell you, this man went down to his house justified
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.680]   rather than the other.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.780]   "For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled,
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.720]   but the one who humbles himself will be exalted."
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.260]   Now, they were bringing even infants to him
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.820]   that he might touch them.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.080]   And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.080]   But Jesus said to him, called them to him saying,
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.160]   "Let the children come to me and do not hinder them,
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.440]   for to such belongs the kingdom of God.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.820]   Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.280]   the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it."
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.600]   That's God's word.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.440]   Let's pray.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.280]   Father, it is always a holy thing to come to your word.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.200]   We don't come to it lightly.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.980]   We come to it with an amount of sobriety
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.160]   because we know what it really is.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.920]   We know that it's living.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.280]   We know that it's active.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.480]   We know that it's sharper than a sword,
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.720]   that it pierces us, it divides our motives.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.000]   It susses us out, God.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.220]   It finds us out.
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.500]   It exposes us.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.680]   It convicts us.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.960]   And it is able to provide the wisdom to us,
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.340]   to lead us to salvation, Paul says.
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.600]   And we also understand that this word is,
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.220]   in the words of Paul, spiritually apprehended,
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.920]   which means apart from the Holy Spirit
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.920]   doing something tonight, this is a big waste of our time.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:51.160]   And God, we're gonna hear words spoken and read
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.320]   and preached, but if your spirit doesn't allow us
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.960]   to apprehend these things, we're gonna have a stubbornness
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.040]   in our heart and a blindness and a hardness.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.280]   We don't want that.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.520]   We don't want that.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.760]   So we are appealing to you, the kind one,
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.920]   to give us grace as we understand,
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.520]   seek to understand your word.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.200]   Would your spirit come alongside the truth
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.240]   and awaken hearts?
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.320]   Help us to believe, we pray.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.040]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.680]   Amen.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.920]   Well, when I was in middle school,
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.380]   I was not what you would call an athletic individual.
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.160]   That was not what you would call me.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.660]   There were words that you could call me.
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.660]   Rotund was a word.
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.680]   Non-fast, sweaty.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.560]   These are all words that you could call me
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.280]   in middle school, but athletic was not one of them.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.160]   So you can imagine PE was a little bit
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.060]   of a trouble spot for me.
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.640]   And one day, as I was in eighth grade,
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.760]   I showed up to PE and I found out
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.240]   that we were having a badminton tournament.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.960]   Now, I don't know if you know anything about badminton,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.800]   but you should know that slow reflexes
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.680]   and poor eye-hand coordination are not your friend
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.960]   when you're playing the game, okay?
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.280]   It's not gonna help you in this game.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.120]   So our teacher starts pairing us up,
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.920]   and to add insult to injury, I was paired up last, classic.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.360]   And the guy that I got paired with was a guy named Paul.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.920]   Now, you don't know Paul.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.920]   And to be fair, I was nothing to write home about.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:41.120]   But compared to Paul, I was LeBron James.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.400]   And so there we were, the two last guys
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.440]   being paired up, me and Paul.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.920]   This was not looking very good for us,
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.800]   and our first game starts, and we start playing
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.280]   this really bizarre game, by the way.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.460]   This game, and game one finishes, and we win.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.320]   Which is, yeah, I laughed too, 'cause I didn't think
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.640]   it was a thing that could happen.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.040]   And I thought, okay, well, just downhill from here, I guess.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.880]   And we move up in the bracket.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.680]   Next game happens, and we win.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.980]   Semi-finals.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.680]   We win!
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.360]   And I look at Paul at some point,
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.440]   and we just have this moment where we're like,
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.840]   we're losers.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.820]   But this could happen, right?
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.660]   This thing could happen.
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.960]   And so somehow, somehow, by God's providence,
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.760]   we find ourselves in the finals, and it is on, man.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.600]   Paul's swinging left, I'm dodging right,
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.920]   birdies are flying, we're like two chunky
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.120]   Andre Agassiz going at it.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.120]   And somehow, we pull it off, and we sweep the whole thing.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.560]   We win the whole thing.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.040]   To this day, it is my crowning athletic achievement.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.460]   That's it, it doesn't get, yes, yes, thank you for that.
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.440]   What happened?
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.360]   How was that possible?
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.880]   Like, that shouldn't be how it went down, right?
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.000]   It wasn't like we were bringing something
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.160]   really valuable to the table, you know what I mean?
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.180]   Like, we weren't great.
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.180]   The other teams knew it, and I think that actually
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.720]   played to our favor because they let their guard down.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.920]   Me and Paul knew it, and that actually kind of loosened us
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.680]   up a bit 'cause we knew we had nothing to lose, right?
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.000]   We had everything to gain.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.040]   And this interesting cocktail of our mutual suckiness
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.600]   worked together in order for us to actually
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.560]   sweep the thing.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.800]   It worked to our advantage to be losers.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.920]   It was amazing.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.580]   The thing that we thought would make us fail, listen,
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.860]   was the very thing that helped us win.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.560]   Now, why am I telling you that story?
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.420]   Well, this evening, we are immersing ourselves
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.240]   in a passage that has everything to do with prayer,
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.520]   and specifically, the kinds of prayer
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.900]   that God responds to, right?
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.480]   And I don't know what comes to your mind
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.000]   when you think about prayer.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.320]   When I say that word, how that strikes you,
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.360]   how that makes you feel, but I do know
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.200]   prayer can be a tricky thing for us, right?
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:23.200]   It can be hard and messy and clumsy.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.440]   You know, maybe when you think about prayer,
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.320]   maybe you're just worn out, right?
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.140]   Because for you, even when I say that,
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:31.980]   something comes to your mind,
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.400]   something you've been pleading with God for,
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.520]   it's just not happening, right?
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.320]   And it's been kind of exhausting for you,
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.120]   and like, why isn't this getting off the ground?
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.240]   What more do I need to do to make this thing happen, right?
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.760]   Maybe that's you, so that you just feel frustration, right?
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.440]   Maybe for you, it's anxiety, like,
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.440]   what's the words that I say
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.740]   that turn the switch in God's heart?
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.160]   Like, I just don't know, do I go really regal
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.640]   and add some vowels in there, or do I like dial it back?
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.640]   Like, how do I make this thing work?
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.120]   You know, I don't know how it strikes you.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.320]   Maybe for you, you're none of those.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.920]   Maybe for you, that's kind of the last place you wanna be,
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.520]   the last thing you wanna be doing,
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.400]   because when you think about prayer,
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:17.280]   all that you feel is that backpack of shame and guilt on you
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.680]   from your life, and actually coming into the presence of God
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.420]   it just feels like impossible.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.280]   What am I gonna do?
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.040]   I'm gonna come into God's presence knowing what I did?
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.800]   I just feel, if you knew what I did,
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.520]   so how could I come to him?
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.280]   There's just shame and guilt around that whole thing.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.560]   So maybe for you, it's like,
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.860]   my job is really not to pray, but to get my act together
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.640]   so that I can finally pray and talk to him.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.560]   I know I felt that a lot over my life.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.960]   Well, I don't know where you are, but wherever you are,
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.020]   we're all asking kind of the same fundamental question,
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:55.860]   aren't we?
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.680]   And it's this question of like,
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.560]   what does it take to get God to respond?
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.920]   I mean, what does it take for this interaction
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.300]   to be meaningful?
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.800]   Like, what moves the needle in my prayer life?
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.560]   What can give me that competitive edge, so to speak?
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:16.040]   Well, Jesus is answering that question tonight.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.560]   He's about to show us that the advantage
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.160]   that we are looking for is found in unlikely place,
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.560]   that it is found in your weakness.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.480]   That it's found in your weakness,
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:36.240]   that when it comes to prayer, weakness is the way.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.760]   That's actually the main point tonight.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.760]   Hold onto that, weakness is the way,
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.540]   that just like with me and my buddy Paul,
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:48.640]   it's precisely the fact that we have nothing to lose
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.360]   and everything to gain that actually gives us
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.040]   that advantage in prayer that causes his ear
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.720]   to bend low to us and his heart to soften toward us.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.000]   Weakness is the way.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.920]   And he's gonna show us this by giving us
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.920]   three very unexpected role models for prayer.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.200]   We're gonna sort of peer through three different windows
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   and see what comprises a person who gets the attention of
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.920]   and the intimacy of God.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.840]   That's what we're doing here.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.860]   So we have a lot to cover.
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.960]   Here's how it's gonna work.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.840]   We're just gonna do an overview of these three scenes,
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.960]   peering into these three windows that Luke lays out for us.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.720]   Then we're gonna back the camera off some,
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.680]   we're gonna draw a few conclusions and we'll be done.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.880]   So that's where we're heading.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.160]   So again, have that Bible out on your lap.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.920]   We're in Luke 18 and we're gonna start back again
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:46.340]   at the top, verse one, scene one.
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:50.720]   And he told them a parable to the effect
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.700]   that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.040]   Stop right there.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.680]   So Luke is being really nice to us right now
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.000]   and he tells us up front what this parable means,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.120]   which is a blessing to a guy like me
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.160]   'cause sometimes I come up on Jesus in the scriptures
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.360]   and I'm like, I don't know what those words mean together.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.600]   And so it's nice when the author can go,
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.120]   "Hey, by the way, he means this, he's cutting me a break."
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.020]   So he tells us up front what it is and here's what it is.
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.960]   This parable was told, did you see it?
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.640]   So that we would always pray and not lose heart.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.360]   You don't have to ask what the point of the parable is,
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.200]   there it is.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.260]   So that we would always pray and not lose heart.
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.480]   Let's continue, verse two.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.520]   He said in a certain city, there was a judge
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.960]   who neither feared God nor respected man.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.360]   And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.520]   and saying, "Give me justice against my adversary."
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.840]   For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself,
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.200]   "Though I neither fear God nor respect man,
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.020]   "yet because this widow keeps bothering me,
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.220]   "I will give her justice so that she will not beat me down
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.480]   "by her continual coming."
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.960]   And the Lord said, "Hear what the unrighteous judge says.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.660]   "And will not God give justice to his elect
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.940]   "who cry out to him day and night?
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.780]   "Will he delay long over them?
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.420]   "I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily.
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.100]   "Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes,
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.720]   "will he find faith on the earth?"
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.760]   Okay, so stop there.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.160]   This is the first of our three scenes,
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.880]   and it's a parable about prayer.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:16.760]   We learn that God hears his people
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.400]   and is eager to do them good and bring justice for them.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.640]   And that should drive us to our knees in prayer
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.760]   because we know we have a God who cares for us.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.440]   Again, that is the point of this parable.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.600]   That's the lay of the land.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.480]   But now there's something else
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.680]   that I don't want us to miss
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.320]   'cause there's something happening beneath the surface here
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.720]   that we have to catch
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.420]   if we wanna get the full scope of this moment.
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.520]   What's beneath the surface?
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.200]   Well, think about this for a moment with me.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   Think about the casting of this parable.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.080]   Who makes up the cast list right here?
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.720]   Well, it's a small cast, right?
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.360]   There's two characters.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.280]   You have the judge
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.880]   who will be playing the role of God today, right?
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.240]   That's the judge not doing a hot job at it, right?
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.300]   And then you have the widow.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.020]   And so who are we in the story?
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:14.720]   Well, if the judge is playing God, then who's playing us?
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:19.320]   Wait for it, here, oh, genius.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.280]   The widow, right?
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.120]   It's the widow.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.120]   It's obviously the widow.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:27.120]   We are the widow in this story of Jesus's.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.680]   Have you ever played that game with your friends?
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.600]   I'm like a cinephile, I love movies.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.120]   Like I'm all about it.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.120]   We play a game like where you go,
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.080]   hey, if you could cast any character
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.520]   as like my biopic character to play me,
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.180]   you know, who would that be?
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.520]   It's also called find out who your real friends are game.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.760]   You ever played that game?
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.600]   No?
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.640]   I personally like to think of myself
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.300]   as like a slightly stronger Dwayne Johnson, okay?
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.280]   But do you know, and I'm not making this part up,
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.560]   do you know who my friends pick for me
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.360]   every time we play the game?
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.160]   All different groups of friends.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.640]   It's like they've conspired.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.820]   Jack Black.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.760]   Jack Black.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.680]   That is not a self-esteem booster.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.120]   I don't know if you know that.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:25.680]   This is a Jack Black moment for his disciples.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.600]   That's what this is.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.080]   Wait, you're casting me as the widow?
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.160]   I'm the, we're the widow in this story?
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.720]   Widow doesn't have the same stigma today as it did them,
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.280]   but just get a sense of this.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.640]   In their day, a widow was powerless.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.480]   You hear me?
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.300]   Powerless.
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.680]   She was without influence in the society.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.340]   She was very susceptible to being taken advantage of.
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.320]   She was socially and financially vulnerable.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.520]   Commentators even tell us that not even the land
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.440]   that she would have got from her husband
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.960]   was guaranteed after he died
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.040]   because that land was connected to his family of origin,
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.040]   not his family of marriage.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.640]   And that made her incredibly dependent
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.800]   on the kindness and generosity of others.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.720]   So she has to plead for the judge.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.440]   She has to beg to him.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.800]   He is her only hope for justice.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.640]   Do you see that?
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.520]   Do you feel that now?
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.120]   And Jesus is saying, yeah, be like that.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.560]   Do you feel that a little bit more?
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.360]   Does that strike you now?
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.200]   You're starting to see the point.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.520]   Apart from, listen, apart from being tethered
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:39.520]   to the God of the universe, we have nothing.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.360]   We are nothing.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.540]   We bring nothing to the table.
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.960]   So if we want justice as God's people,
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.440]   we can't muster it ourselves.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.080]   We're powerless until we look to him in prayer.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:55.920]   Do you see that?
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.800]   Jesus is saying something profound.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.760]   This is what he's saying.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.240]   If you want your needs met,
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.180]   you have to see yourself as needy.
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:13.080]   If you want your needs met, right, you want that,
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.960]   then you have to concede, I'm needy.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.920]   And man, that's a sideways pill to swallow, isn't it?
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.980]   That's just hard.
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.520]   It's like easy to talk about what we want,
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.440]   but it's hard to say, and I'm needy and I'm desperate,
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.000]   and you're my only hope.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.140]   Weakness is the way.
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.600]   Anyone bummed yet?
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.720]   He's not done.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.040]   Parable two coming at you.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.600]   Verse nine, he also told this parable
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.880]   to some who trusted in themselves,
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.120]   that they were righteous and treated others with contempt.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.520]   Again, thank you, Luke.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.800]   Jesus told us this parable to do what?
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.880]   To rebuke self-righteous people who look down on others.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.480]   Let's continue, verse 10.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.480]   Two men went up into the temple to pray,
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.600]   one a Pharisee, the other a tax collector.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.080]   The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.760]   God, I thank you that I'm not like other men,
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.200]   extortioners, unjust, adulterers,
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.240]   or even like this tax collector.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.960]   I fast twice a week.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.600]   I give tithes of all that I get,
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.080]   but the tax collector, standing far off,
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.760]   would not even lift up his eyes to heaven,
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.160]   but beat his breast, saying,
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.960]   God, be merciful to me, a sinner.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.680]   I tell you, this man went down to his house justified,
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.040]   rather than the other.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.720]   For anyone who exalts himself will be humbled,
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.120]   but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.080]   So again, we're looking at a case
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.200]   of someone who is helped by God
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.240]   as they acknowledge their weakness and their need.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.120]   Are you starting to see a theme develop here
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.160]   over this passage?
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.880]   But now, who is our cast this time?
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.640]   Again, a small ensemble.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.400]   We got two characters again.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.000]   You have the Pharisee and the tax collector.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.120]   Let's talk about them.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.360]   Let's deal with the Pharisee first.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.720]   Now, this is a tricky bit, right?
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.520]   Because I understand that when I'm bringing up
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.600]   the word Pharisee to a group of modern,
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.400]   sort of evangelical Christians,
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.440]   do you ever, when I say that word Pharisee,
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.080]   do you generally have a positive feeling
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.840]   or a negative feeling?
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.840]   Negative, it strikes you as negative, right?
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.160]   Which means we're totally disconnected
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.280]   from how this would have struck his listeners,
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.080]   because it would not have struck them this way.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.880]   A Pharisee was not a slur back then.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.200]   This was their pastor.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.040]   You feel me?
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.200]   These were their heroes.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.840]   These were the men that you would aspire to be
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.200]   if you lived back then and were a Jew.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.440]   They were godly.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.280]   They were obedient.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.560]   They obeyed the Torah.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.000]   They strived to keep the law.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.040]   That's how they were perceived in their culture.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.760]   It doesn't hit us that way, but it hits them that way.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.000]   This was the hero in the story.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:55.920]   Do you feel me?
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.040]   He was the hero when they were hearing this
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:58.960]   for the first time.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.920]   So that's the first character, the Pharisee.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.680]   Second one, the tax collector.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.000]   Now, again, we got a lot of distance here.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.960]   Like tax collector doesn't have the same,
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.140]   it doesn't hit us, right?
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.760]   But in Palestine, in these days,
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.480]   the tax collector would have been despised.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.320]   Why?
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.600]   They were Jewish citizens who were employed
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.440]   by that insurgent Roman government
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.080]   to take money from their own people
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.080]   and give it to the people that all their people hated.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:28.920]   Right?
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.460]   It's a little awkward when you do that.
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.200]   Now, they didn't just do that.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.800]   That would have been bad enough, right?
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.960]   But what's worse is they were notorious
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.600]   for then taking more from their people than they needed
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.080]   and not giving everything to Caesar
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.620]   and keeping some for themselves
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.000]   and lining their pockets with it.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.900]   So these guys were hated by the Jews, right?
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.820]   They were seen as traitors and thieves and sellouts
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.120]   and completely morally bankrupt.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.240]   Are you getting that picture?
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.360]   That's who these guys were.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:04.260]   And Jesus finishes his parable and he says,
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.240]   this is the guy that they justified.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:12.240]   This is the guy that God sent home righteous.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.680]   This guy.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:18.820]   What would that have felt like to hear?
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.800]   Right?
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.480]   It's again, it's just the sting of it.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.640]   The stinger is missing a little bit in 2019.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.040]   You know, we don't, like, I don't wanna get audited, right?
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.160]   But I don't wanna like plan the murder
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.800]   of the guy who's doing my tax audit, you know?
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.800]   But in this context, man, there was so much animosity there.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.520]   So we need to feel the stigma more.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.080]   We need to feel the uncomfortableness more.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.240]   Let me try one out on you real quick and see if this fits.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.320]   1992, a man by the name of Jeffrey Dahmer
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:04.320]   is given 15 life sentences for the brutal murder
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.040]   of 15 men and teenage boys,
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.160]   most of whom he raped and ate.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:19.320]   Now, in prison, the cannibal, Jeffrey Dahmer
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.560]   was handed some Christian literature,
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.000]   a pamphlet, a gospel track.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.840]   And he starts reading this in his cell.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.240]   And as he's reading, the Holy Spirit explodes his heart
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.680]   with conviction over his sin.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:35.880]   He starts to realize the monster that he is.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:40.880]   And in prison, in his cell, Jeffrey Dahmer bows the knee
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:46.440]   to Jesus Christ and the cannibal becomes a Christian,
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.560]   redeemed, justified.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.420]   Now, how does that feel to hear that?
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:57.640]   To know that if you're in Christ,
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.440]   that when you die, you will be kicking it in heaven
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.560]   with a cannibal.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:06.800]   It feels a little uncomfortable, doesn't it?
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:13.820]   God doesn't respond like that to cannibals, right?
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:19.160]   Like maybe like overeating food,
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.940]   but not humans.
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:27.500]   We don't, he doesn't act like that toward cannibals, right?
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.740]   He's not, he doesn't bend his ear toward them.
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:35.740]   But do you see now, that's the point of the passage.
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.260]   God does do that for cannibals.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:43.300]   He does do that for tax collectors and liars
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.340]   and people who look at pornography and addicts
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:50.360]   and drunkards and every other vice you can imagine.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.280]   That's what he does.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.320]   The point of this is that when we come needy,
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.560]   he responds no matter who we are.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.520]   That's the point, do you see that?
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:06.980]   The problem is, most of us, if we're just being real,
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.060]   most of us don't see ourselves that way.
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.200]   We can even kind of get down with that,
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.560]   the abstract idea of God being a merciful God like that,
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.600]   but we don't see ourselves as being needy.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.360]   We tend to be a lot more like the Pharisee in this story,
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.520]   right, looking at our own record to justify us.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.600]   That's what's happening here.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.560]   But Jesus shows us that what we need
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.340]   is not to act like we have it all together,
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:39.280]   but rather to admit we are morally bankrupt
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.820]   to finally own it.
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.180]   That's what he's inviting us to.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:47.180]   I remember it was, I think it was 10 years ago now.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.260]   I was at a gas station with my wife.
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.580]   We were filling up the car, and the card wouldn't work.
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.060]   A little debit card, Wells Fargo thing, it wouldn't work.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.320]   No gas for Jimmy.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.140]   And I was like, okay, so we do the app thing,
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.180]   see, maybe like we run low or something,
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:05.300]   and my Wells Fargo account tells me
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:10.300]   that I have negative $2 million.
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.260]   I was like, Kelly, what'd you buy?
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.260]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.540]   It was ridiculous.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.900]   Now, there was a glitch in the system, right,
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.400]   and it accidentally debited,
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.060]   so they gave me back my $2 million, thank you.
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.780]   I hate when they take my $2 million from me.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.500]   But they gave it back.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.060]   But what's the point?
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.860]   What did I feel in that moment
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.940]   when I saw that number?
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:42.780]   What did I feel?
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.380]   Immediate despair, right?
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.660]   This is it, babe.
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.000]   We had a good run.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.260]   Yeah, I'll see you later, right?
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.060]   Need?
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.780]   Oh, no, right?
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.620]   Those feelings crept up in me fast,
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.620]   and that's exactly what God is saying
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:11.620]   is the posture of someone who he responds to and justifies.
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.620]   Feel that.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.200]   That's the posture.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.140]   And some of you guys,
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.300]   you are bankrupt spiritually,
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.180]   but you are acting like a millionaire
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:32.580]   as if sort of putting on airs will impress God.
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.580]   Listen, it doesn't impress him.
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:40.760]   Need does, though.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.660]   Need.
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:46.220]   Repent of that.
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.860]   Come to him desperate for forgiveness
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.560]   and watch him give it 'cause he loves to.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.920]   We starting to see the theme?
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.460]   God's ear is bent toward the needy widow
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.500]   and his heart is forgiving to the sinful tax collector
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.300]   and as if to drive his point home one more time,
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.220]   Luke gives us one more story.
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.180]   We're gonna look at it together.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.220]   Verse 15 says this.
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:16.200]   Now they were bringing even infants to him
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.180]   that he might touch them.
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.940]   And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them,
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:23.580]   but Jesus called them to him saying,
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.540]   "Let the children come to me and do not hinder them
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.720]   for to such belongs the kingdom of God.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.620]   Truly I say to you,
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:36.220]   whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.620]   shall not enter it."
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.620]   Again, I just want you to feel this.
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.420]   This is another one of those moments
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.860]   where there's a disconnect here.
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.900]   See, in ancient Jewish culture,
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:53.260]   children were not little bitty bundles of chunky joy, right?
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.900]   They were not, you didn't bounce them on your lap
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.420]   and pass them around.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.340]   That's not what you did with a child.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.420]   They weren't little bundles of joy.
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.520]   They were inconveniences then.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.980]   Not because they were hated by people,
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.460]   but because in Jewish culture,
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.820]   there was a high, high value placed on contribution.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.660]   What can you contribute to the family's good?
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.220]   If you can't contribute to the family's good yet,
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.420]   then you're of low value to us until you can.
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.000]   And so when they saw children back then,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.600]   that was the sense that they got.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.580]   It wasn't an endearing thing.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.660]   And for Jesus, somebody of Jesus's stature
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:34.660]   and notoriety to come around and to bless these infants
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.460]   was beneath the teacher of his stature.
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.300]   Do you see that?
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.200]   It would have been a really surprising
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.300]   and even offensive sight for his disciples to see this.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.780]   That's why they rebuked those kids and those parents.
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:51.780]   And yet here he is, Jesus, holding and blessing infants,
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:55.420]   non-contributors, the vulnerable.
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.820]   And one more time, we're faced with that question, aren't we?
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.020]   How do we see ourselves?
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.260]   That's what his disciples were faced with in this moment.
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.020]   That's what Jesus is doing in this moment.
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:12.020]   Do you see yourself, be honest, when you think about you,
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.580]   do you see yourself as strong,
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:21.860]   self-sustaining, important, substantial?
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:26.020]   Or is the first thought that you have
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:31.020]   when you think about you, needy, dependent, trusting,
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:35.060]   vulnerable, without help?
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:39.940]   Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:44.580]   the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.020]   Let that sober you tonight.
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:49.820]   You feeling challenged?
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:54.220]   These are our three scenes.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:58.500]   These are our three role models.
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:03.500]   And this leaves us with some questions to answer.
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:08.620]   Like, what does a vulnerable widdle,
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.580]   a moral degenerate, and a societal nuisance
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.980]   teach us about prayer?
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.740]   'Cause that's what this passage is.
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.500]   What do they teach us about prayer?
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.880]   Three ending observations.
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.580]   What does this mean for us?
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:30.580]   Number one, your self-reliance will kill you.
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:39.380]   Your self-reliance will kill you.
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:47.660]   There's a lot of encouragement to be had in this passage,
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:51.260]   but this passage is also a warning tonight.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:57.100]   At the very center of Christianity is a concession
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:03.020]   that I lack what I need to be right with God.
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:06.740]   That's at the heart of this thing.
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:12.300]   That I lack the power to change things in me.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.460]   That I lack the power to change things around me.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:21.460]   So to act like you're strong or able or righteous
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:26.980]   or put together in and of yourself
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:31.980]   is not only anti-prayerful, it is anti-Christian.
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:40.700]   The Pharisee was a better man than the tax collector.
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.220]   Do you hear me?
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.460]   No one would have disagreed with this.
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.100]   He wasn't stealing from anybody.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:57.100]   He was keeping the Torah as he knew how.
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.900]   He wasn't committing adultery or cheating
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.180]   or doing these types of things.
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.580]   He wasn't thieving.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:08.580]   He was being good, and he went to hell.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:17.020]   We don't say that in 2019 though, right?
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.900]   We don't talk like that in 2019,
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:24.620]   'cause it's just not, it's better left unsaid, isn't it?
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:28.620]   But do you see that's the point?
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:33.180]   The good guy loses in that story.
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.340]   And the bad guy, the degenerate,
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.940]   the one who owned his need and could come to God
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:42.620]   with all of his bankruptcy, he's the one God justified.
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.300]   The cannibal.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:53.140]   You having it all figured out before you come to God,
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.180]   guys, girls, it's working against you.
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.940]   It's working against you.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:04.780]   Your efforts to be put together and morally pristine
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:07.660]   so that God will accept you,
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:12.060]   those things are working against you tonight.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.620]   It's not good for you.
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:17.780]   Some of you tonight, you're hearing this,
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:22.780]   and what you need to do is lay down your trust in you
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:27.860]   and cast yourself on the mercy of Jesus tonight.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.900]   That's what you need to do.
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.580]   Warts and all.
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.340]   The whole package.
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:42.540]   You will not gain access to him
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.860]   or find answers to your prayers
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.740]   in your prideful self-reliance.
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:49.980]   Our self-reliance will kill us.
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.580]   Number two.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:59.940]   Weakness shows off God's strength.
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:03.380]   It's what it does.
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.380]   Weakness shows off God's strength.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:08.460]   I said earlier that God is attracted to those
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.460]   who have nothing to contribute.
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.420]   Why?
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.260]   Why is that?
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.980]   Why is he inclined to those people
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.540]   over the people who think they have something to contribute?
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:18.380]   Why is that?
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.220]   Here's why.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:24.220]   Because when I contribute nothing to God except my need,
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.860]   then God must contribute everything else.
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.300]   And when God contributes everything else,
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.380]   who is the one that in the end I get to brag on
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:36.020]   as having done something good?
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.940]   Who is the one at the end that I can point at
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.180]   and celebrate and say, "That's praiseworthy"?
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.300]   I'm not allowed to point at me anymore.
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:49.300]   If he made the contribution, I can only point at him.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.020]   This is Christianity.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.340]   If you're wondering what this whole thing was,
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.700]   maybe you're here for one of the first times,
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.620]   you're just trying to sort out
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:00.740]   what this Christian thing is, this is it.
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.500]   This is the gospel.
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.660]   You and I rebelled against God.
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.140]   Our first parents did it,
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.980]   and we learned a good lesson from them.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.420]   We keep on doing it, don't we?
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.780]   We stiff on him at every turn.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:16.660]   And God in his mercy, instead of leaving us, he pursued us.
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.860]   He condescended to come get us in the person of Jesus.
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:22.260]   Jesus lived the perfect life.
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.940]   You and I could never do in our place.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.900]   He made the contribution.
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.780]   He hung up on a Roman cross
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:30.900]   and bled out for six hours in our place.
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.900]   His contribution, not ours, rose from the grave,
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.420]   defeated death, conquered all our enemies in our place.
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.780]   His contribution.
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.900]   In the end, every Christian will never be able
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:42.980]   to point at themselves.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.420]   If you're truly in Christ, the best we can do,
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.700]   the greatest thing we can do is only point at the one
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:51.580]   who made the contribution, and that's Jesus every time.
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.740]   That is the gospel.
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.780]   We're needy, he is the need meter.
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.300]   Do you see that?
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.180]   And praise God for that.
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:05.180]   And if that's true, if he's the strong one when I'm weak,
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.220]   if he's the powerful one when I'm not powerful,
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:11.020]   if he's the contributor when my basket's empty
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.780]   and I have nothing to give to him, if that's true,
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.800]   then this last point is true.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:21.060]   When things feel the most hopeless,
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.260]   that's when there's the most hope.
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.140]   That's when there's the most hope.
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.140]   If what we've just seen from Luke is true,
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:34.980]   our optimism, listen, your optimism in your prayer life
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:38.620]   should be exploding if you feel like you're not bringing
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:39.820]   much to the table.
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:44.820]   It should be exploding and bursting out because you can't,
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.340]   but you serve the God who can.
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:52.380]   That's who we serve, and that gives us such a confidence.
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.180]   When things are the most hopeless,
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.380]   that's when there's the most hope.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.020]   Are you crippled by your sin tonight?
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:01.740]   Man, you just came in and you're just wrecked, right?
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.340]   And you know, like, this week,
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:06.300]   like maybe the Holy Spirit's actually been poking
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.380]   at your conscience and maybe it's for the first time,
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.540]   and you're just like, I'm just, I'm a mess.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.980]   What am I even doing in this room?
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.860]   Addiction has you by the throat.
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.860]   You can't get out of it, right?
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.260]   You keep on stumbling.
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:19.660]   Is there any hope for me?
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.460]   Yes, pray.
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:26.320]   Pray, pray to the one who loves bringing triumph
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.580]   out of failure.
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.940]   That's what we do when we feel bankrupt morally.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:32.740]   We come to him and we pray.
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:36.220]   Do you feel like our, when you look around,
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.660]   that like our culture is just like falling apart?
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.340]   Like what, where am I living anymore?
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.820]   What a tragedy this is.
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:47.060]   Is your heart breaking as you're hearing reports
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:52.060]   of 3,000 babies a day being murdered legally in our country?
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.240]   Does that break your heart and you want to see change?
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:00.620]   Or just the ridiculous amounts of still in 2019,
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:05.260]   racial tension, like the almost total absence of diversity
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:09.540]   in the church in America, like, does that break your heart?
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.200]   Do you want to see change?
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:17.140]   Pray, plead to the God who just told us,
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:21.260]   I give justice to my elect, I make these things happen.
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:23.700]   Are you a person who's just trying to hustle
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:24.700]   and make it happen yourself?
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.780]   You got all these plans, but you're not hitting your knees.
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.420]   You're not doing what the text says.
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.300]   The text says, come to him.
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.420]   The text says, plead with the judge
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:35.180]   and he'll bring that justice.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.140]   He loves doing that.
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.120]   Pray to him.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.180]   If you have broken relationships in your life
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.740]   and you're wanting to see healing there, pray to him.
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.300]   Are you desperate to see your friends saved,
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.820]   your parents saved, your siblings saved,
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.340]   the folks at your work come to know Jesus?
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.420]   The literally billions of people
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.460]   who've never heard the name of Jesus
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.340]   at one time in the whole world,
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:03.540]   you want to see them come to know Jesus?
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:04.900]   You know, the first thing you need to do
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:09.140]   is fall on your knees and plead to God.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.140]   If this is telling us anything,
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:15.540]   it's that when it feels so insurmountable,
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.940]   and it feels like there's no, how could this,
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.500]   how could we ever move the needle?
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.780]   That's the best time to plead with him
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.960]   because it's gonna make God look great
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.960]   when he starts answering those prayers.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.460]   When he comes through, he looks great
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:32.740]   and he wants to look great on your behalf.
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.180]   Pray and plead with him.
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.840]   Come weak, come lowly,
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.380]   but come, like tonight, come, pray.
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:43.940]   This is an opportunity for you.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:46.380]   You're not here on accident.
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:49.580]   You're here to hear this word
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:53.180]   and respond by crying out to God
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:56.100]   who's eager to show off his strength for you.
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:00.780]   I am the God, Jeremiah says, I am the God of all flesh.
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.780]   Is anything too difficult for me?
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:05.020]   No, it is for you.
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.540]   It's not for him.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.380]   Plead with him.
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:10.180]   We do what that song says.
[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:13.440]   Nothing in my hands I bring.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:17.280]   Simply to thy cross I cling.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.340]   Nothing, that's what you need tonight.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.020]   Will you come with that?
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.780]   'Cause that's all you gotta come with.
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:24.680]   Come with nothing.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.640]   Let's pray to him now.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:43.460]   Just give you a minute for the Lord
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.700]   to work these truths into your heart.
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:50.600]   And then just ask him if maybe you've got some walls
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.520]   going up and you just ask him,
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.960]   God, would you be kind to me, tear down these walls,
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:59.000]   help me be soft tonight and receive these things.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:07.200]   If your heart's been hard and you're struggling
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.760]   and sin and failure and you've kind of realized it tonight
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.220]   and you're like, man, I just,
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:17.760]   I need change, but I can't.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.380]   I just never been able to and I still can't.
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:24.060]   Praise God for Jesus tonight.
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:28.640]   Like literally praise him.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.280]   Thank him for him.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.640]   Ask him to send his spirit to work in you
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.580]   and help you, free you.
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:40.900]   Cast yourself on Christ tonight.
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.440]   God, we,
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.480]   we have nothing and are nothing without you,
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.140]   but we look to you, the strong one.
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:56.120]   Will you show off tonight in human hearts
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:00.080]   so that your fame and your renown
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:05.080]   would be made much of tonight and forever.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.880]   In Jesus' good name, amen.
