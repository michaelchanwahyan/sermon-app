[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   [Music]
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   What's up, Porch? How we doing? Let's go. How we doing? We doing good?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   You know, that seems like the appropriate question to ask whenever I get up here.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Just to amass a massive amount of applause and cheering and ruckus, but like,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   really, how are you doing tonight? Good? Yeah? Good. Blessed? Stressed?
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Coming from work? I don't know about you.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   I was just sitting over there and I just felt like anxious, man.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   And it's probably because I'm speeding into tonight.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Like I feel like I've been steamrolling all day and I'm racing into this evening.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And I just had this moment where, as I was sitting there,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   it just felt like the Lord was asking me to just, hey, just take a breath.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Like, calm down, slow down. I don't know about you.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I don't know where you're coming from.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Maybe you're walking in and you're like, dude,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   I have been like in step with the spirit all day. I feel amazing.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Maybe you're here and you're like, man, I haven't been able to shut off work.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I'm still thinking about what's coming up tomorrow. I didn't, I didn't really engage.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I didn't feel any sort of emotion over the course of those last three songs.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   If that's you, that was me. And I just want to tell you,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   you haven't missed it yet.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Like God has something for you tonight.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   We genuinely believe that every person that walks into this room,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   God has brought you here very specifically, whether you know him or not.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Our genuine belief is, is no one is in this room by accident.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   So we're really glad you're here. We're really glad you're here.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   We believe that God wants to do something in your life tonight.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   And we also think that God's doing things all over the nation.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And so I want to give a special shout out to some Porch Live locations that are
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   tuning in with us tonight. I want to say hey to Fresno, to Atlanta, and to Scottsdale.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   God is doing a good thing here, but he's doing a good thing there.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And so we thank y'all for tuning in and being a part of what God is doing through the porch.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Friends, we've been in a series called Ins and Outs.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And the entire purpose of this series is to ask the question,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   do my goals align with God's will?
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And what we realized as we were looking through the research and we were parsing through the data is,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   by and large, we have three goals. Our generation, whether you're Gen Z or you're millennial,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   the young adults of the world have said there are three things we want.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   We want to be self-sufficient. We want to be self-fulfilled.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And we want to be self-accepted.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   These are the things that we have said are in for 2024.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I don't know what you've been thinking,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   but this is what the other young adults in the room have said is true of themselves.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   They have voted this is the case.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   The last two weeks, we've talked about why self-fulfillment and self-sufficiency are actually out.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And God has something else in for us instead.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Tonight, we're going to be talking about why self-acceptance is out according to the will of God.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And to help us unpack that idea, we have a very special friend in the room with us tonight.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   We have Mr. Nate Hilgenkamp.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Give him a round of applause, everybody.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Nate is the teaching pastor at Harris Creek in Waco.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   He's also one of the co-hosts on the Becoming Something podcast.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   He's a dear friend of my own.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And here's what you need to know about Nate.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   He's going to crush it up here.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   But as great as he is up here, he's even better on the floor.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   He is an incredible communicator of God's will, but he is also -- he's a great example of Christ's likeness.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   And so we are thrilled, honored to have you here with us, bro.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   So friends, do it one more time.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Give Nate Hilgenkamp a round of applause as he comes to the stage.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Love you, brother.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Love you, brother.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Love you.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Well, those are some kind words about me, but who cares about me?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I'm going home after tonight.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Let me tell you a little bit about your guy, Kylan.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I know you just kind of got to meet him a couple of weeks ago.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I've got to know him for a little bit longer than that.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So let me just tell you a little bit about who he is.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I want to tell you about three things.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   The first is this.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   He kind of took the words out of my mouth.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   He is much better off the stage than he is on the stage.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   He can preach the lights out, but he's a far better minister just in front of people one on one.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I've seen him do an amazing job counseling young adults year after year off the stage, not just on the stage.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Secondly, I've got to process some things with him in my life, some things that maybe haven't gone how we expected them to go,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   and he's always driven me to faith.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   He's always driven me to trust in Jesus.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   He's a man of deep faith.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And then thirdly, I've got to see him lead huddles before every single young adult event I've got to do with him,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   and every single one of those huddles is fueled by prayer.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So three things about Kylan that you need to know.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   He's a better person off the stage than on the stage.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   He's a man of great faith, and he's a man of great prayer,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   and I cannot think of a better person to lead the porch for the next 40 years.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Is that what you told me?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   40 years.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   He's committing to 40 years.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   He's going to do an amazing job.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Well, I just wanted to start tonight by telling you I worked at a church in Waco, Texas,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   and for seven years I was the college pastor there,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   which meant I really did one thing with my job because Baylor University is located on this side.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   There we go.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Oh, man, that makes me so happy.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   On this side of 35 and right on the other side of 35 is a Chick-fil-A, which was essentially my office for seven years.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   I was there about three or four times a week just meeting with college students,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   and one day I went in like I do nearly every other day and go up and place my order,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   the spicy chicken sandwich meal with a Coke Zero, and didn't really think anything of it.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   But once I stood in line and got up to the counter, there was like this teenage kid who was working there,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   and he was just very excited to be working at Chick-fil-A that day.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And he saw me, and he goes, "Ben, it's so good to see you today.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Can I take your order?"
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Again, my name's Nate, not Ben.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   So in that moment I'm like, "Okay, what am I going to do?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Do I correct him or not?"
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   I'm like, "This guy's a teenager.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   He's a high schooler.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   He's just happy to be here.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   He doesn't really know me, but he thinks he knows me, so I'm just going to roll with it."
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   So I place my order, sit back down, don't think anything of it, show back again.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I don't know if it was the next day or the day after that.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And I walk in the doors and realize that he's working again.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   And I'm like, "Lord, please do not let me go to his register."
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   So I walk in the line and get to his register, and he goes, "Ben!
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   It's so good to see you.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   So glad you're back.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   What can I get for you today?"
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And at that point, I'm like in it too deep.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I can't correct him now.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   So at that point, I'm just like, "I guess whenever I step in these walls, I am Ben now."
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   So I kid you not, I still cannot believe I did this.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   For the next few months, whenever I would go to Chick-fil-A, whether it was him or someone else,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I'd say, "Yeah, my name is Ben."
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And one day, I was sadly going through the drive-thru by myself,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   and they were standing there with the iPad, and it wasn't this guy.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   It was someone else, and he goes, "Okay, and what's your name?"
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And I just said, "Hey, my name's Ben."
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And then I get up to the drive-thru window, and my nightmare happened.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   One of my friends was working, and he goes, "Nate, I am so sorry.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Like this typically doesn't happen. You know, we're Chick-fil-A, but we lost your order.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   What can I make for you? We'll do it really, really fast, I promise."
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And I said, "You know what? Do you by chance have an order for Ben?"
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And he goes, "Yeah, it's the next one. Why?"
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   I go, "I accidentally said my name was Ben."
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And he just like took the bag and handed it to me.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   It was like, "What in the world is going on?"
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And I'll never forget leaving Chick-fil-A that day.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   As I was leaving, I was like, "For the rest of my life, whenever I go into that Chick-fil-A, I'm no longer Ben.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   I'm going to walk in with my chest out and say, 'I am Nate Hilgenkamp, thank you very much,'
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   because that teenage kid had no right to rename me."
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   And that is a ridiculous story. It's a 100% true story.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And I bet you don't have that story.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   But I bet your story might look a little bit similar to it.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Because I bet you've been renamed.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   I don't know who it's been for you, but maybe growing up, your mom told you one day,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   "You know, you're just not really as pretty as the other girls in your class."
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   But that's happened to some of you. It has.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And in the back of your mind, from that day moving forward, for years now,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   you feel like you've been renamed as, "I'm just not very pretty."
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Or maybe some of you, you've been renamed by a boyfriend.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   You were dating for a while, and eventually you broke up, and he said,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   "You know, whenever we're together, I just don't really enjoy my time with you."
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And so from that moment on, you've just gone by the name "unenjoyable."
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Or maybe you've let a sin rename you, whether it be lust, or drinking too much, or cynicism.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   You've just let this sin grow in your heart and in your mind,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   and in the back of your mind, it has renamed you as "damaged goods."
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Or maybe you've had a teacher rename you, or a coach rename you, or a boss rename you,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   and say, "You know, you're just not really as good as everyone else."
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And in the back of your mind, your name is now "unsuccessful."
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And you've been carrying around a name for far too long.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   And you've allowed someone to rename you who has no right to rename you.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Now, some of you know that.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   You know that other people don't have the power to rename you,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   so you've decided to take it within your own power to rename you.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   You've got these daily affirmations, these things you want to speak over your life,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   you want to manifest into your life, so you've decided that you want your name to be something like,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   "I am successful," or "I am attractive," or "I am wanted."
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And day after day, you're telling yourself this.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   You're trying to rename yourself.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   You're trying to manifest it into your life, and I just want you to know something.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   If that's you, you are taking a name from someone who has no power to rename you.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Because they can't rename you, your sin can't rename you, and you can't rename you.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   There's only one person who can name you, and that's what we're going to talk about tonight.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Who has God named you to be, and what does that mean for your life?
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   We're going to talk about that what is out is self-image or self-acceptance,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   who you view yourself to be, and what is in is God's acceptance and God's image,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   who he has declared you to be.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   And we're going to take a look at that in Scripture in 1 Peter.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   So if you've got your Bibles, open up to 1 Peter.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Just to give you some help, it's right before 2 Peter.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Find 2 Peter, and then just flip right before it, and you'll be right there.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   And there's a lot of different places in Scripture where we can go to look at what God has named us.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   But I want to go here because, man, this is a name I haven't really thought a whole lot before.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I studied this text, and this is a name that has just absolutely gripped me.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   And just some setup on 1 Peter.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   It was written during a time of immense persecution for the church.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   It was written by Peter, and it was written during a time when Nero was the emperor of Rome.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   If you don't know anything about Nero, he was an incredibly depraved man, an evil, evil man.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   I could tell you a number of stories. Here's potentially one of the worst.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   He was married to someone, and then he actually killed her.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Historians believe that he beat her to death.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Shortly thereafter, he saw a young boy who he thought looked like his now deceased wife,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   so he took that boy, castrated that boy, married that boy, and made him dress up like his ex-wife.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Like it's evil stuff. Evil stuff.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Here's another. You maybe heard of the great fire of Rome.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   That was, historians believe, likely started by Nero himself.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   As the emperor, he set ablaze the entire city of Rome, and it actually set 75% of the city on fire.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   He did it because he wanted to rebuild the city however he saw fit.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Once the fire had been put out, he needed someone to blame.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   He had a people group that he did not like very much, so he decided to blame the great fire of Rome on Christians.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   From that moment on, he began the systematic massacre of Christians.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Some were killed by animals. Some were lifted up on crosses to die,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   while others were lifted up on poles and lit aflame at night to serve as lamps to the city of Rome.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   True story.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Now, this is what's going on when Peter wrote this book.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   This is what's happening to the church. They're being persecuted immensely.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   So what Peter's going to say is, the only way you're going to make it through this persecution,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   the only way you're going to make it through this pain, is if you know two things.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   If you know who you are and what that means for you.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   One of the reasons why I wanted to teach 1 Peter is because the trend is not our friend in American culture today.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   American culture is not drifting more and more towards Christianity, but it's drifting more and more towards hostility towards Christianity.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   While we are not where they were at the time of this writing, we're getting closer and closer.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   And the only way you're going to make it through that is if you know two things.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   If you know who you are and what that means for you.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   So that's what I'm going to try to answer tonight.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   We're going to be in 1 Peter chapter 1, looking at verse 1.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Peter writes this.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect exiles, scattered throughout the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Now all of that is in what is now today's modern Turkey.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Now this next verse, I don't know another verse that more completely and accurately describes the Trinity.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Check this out. It says this.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Those of you who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   to be obedient to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood, grace and peace be yours in abundance.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Okay, so by my count, there's three names that Peter gives us here.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Elect, chosen, and exiles.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Now what's interesting to me, maybe it's interesting to you, two of those names are really similar.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Elect and chosen, while the other is very different.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   The name exile.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And what I find fascinating is right there in verse 1, he brings the two together.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   This is what he says. He says that he's writing to the elect exiles.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   To the chosen, unchosen ones.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   And this is the first thing we can learn tonight.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   This is what you've been named. Point number one.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   In Jesus, we are elect exiles.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   We're elect exiles.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Now how can we be both of those names at once?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   That doesn't really make sense. Those two names mean two very different things.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   How can we be those two names at the same time?
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Let me break down that name by breaking down both of those words.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Let's start by talking about elect or chosen.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   And I want to explain that word by telling you about one of my favorite moments I had while I was dating my now wife Adelie in college.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Whenever we were just dating, we were, for those of you that went to Baylor or been in Waco,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   we were driving down the street called Valley Mills, which is kind of this street that just kind of cuts through the heart of the city.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   And it was a very normal day, but I will never forget where I was when this happened.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Because we were at a stoplight, headed back to school, and I'm just looking over at my girlfriend, talking with her, enjoying being with her.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And as I'm talking with her, I realize out of the corner of my eye that the car next to us is not very happy with me.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Like she's in this car and she's screaming at me, going like this, doing everything she possibly can do to get my attention.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Until eventually, she opens her car door.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   She doesn't even roll down her window. I assume because she can't, but she just opens up her window, gets out of her car, and is screaming at me like this.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   So, being the man in the relationship, I rolled down the passenger window so my wife could take the first blow.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   And I'm assuming I'm about to get in a fight, and I just look over at her, and she's screaming, making a scene.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   She's going, "Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   And I roll down the window, and she goes, "Son, I have never seen a man look at a woman the way you're looking at that girl.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   And if you don't put a ring on her finger, you've lost your mind!"
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Yeah. That can only happen in Waco. I mean, truly.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   And I love that story because it's like I remember how I felt when I was dating Adelie Lambert.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   I was like, "I cannot believe she chose me!"
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   Like, I didn't have a whole lot to offer at Baylor.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   I wasn't in a fraternity. I was a religion major.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Like, didn't have a path to make a whole lot of money.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Like, there wasn't a whole lot going for me.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   And she chose me.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   So, whenever we were with her, whenever I was with her, I was like, "I cannot believe that I get to be with Adelie Lambert.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   I cannot believe that she chose me!"
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   You know, in your relationship with God, you've probably been told, you know, you need to be with God.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And you do, but you've got a lot going on. You've got a lot of chaos in your life.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   And so, in the chaos of your life, maybe you wake up, and you just keep telling yourself,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   "Okay, today I want to choose Jesus today. I want to choose Jesus today. I want to choose Jesus today."
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   I just want you to know, if that's your thinking in this relationship, you've got the dynamics all messed up.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Because it's not, "Okay, today I have to choose Jesus."
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   It's instead, "I cannot believe that He chose me."
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   This is what Peter is writing to the church. He's going, "Guys, the God of the universe has chosen you.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Jesus, the Savior of the world, wants you. Your Father so deeply loves you that He sent His Son to live for you.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   He sent Him to be crucified for you. He sent Him to die for you. He sent Him to resurrect for you.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   And I don't know about you, but I didn't have a whole lot to offer to God.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   All I had done is run from His presence, throw myself in a pit, and cover myself in shame and godlessness and arrogance and lust and a whole host of other sins.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   And God saw me in the midst of that pit and said, "I want that one."
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   And it's like, "You want that one?" Like the runt of the litter.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   "You want that one?" And God's going, "Yes, I want that one. I want Him. I want Her. I choose Them."
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And you see, when we were lost, God found us. When we were dirty, our God cleansed us.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   And when we were dead, our God raised us. Why? Because He wants you.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   And this is the first part of this name, "Elect Exiles."
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Friends, He's chosen you. Out of the crowd, He wants you, not because you have anything to offer, but because it's His desire to have a relationship with you.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   So that's the first part of the passage, "Elect" or "Chosen."
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   How can the other part be "Exile"? How are we the "Elect Exiles"?
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Well, here's what ends up happening.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Whenever you realize that you're chosen by God, this world is going to start to not choose you.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Because whenever you feel at home in God's presence, you're just not going to feel at home here.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   And that word "exile" here in this passage, it can also be translated as "foreigner."
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   So what Peter's trying to describe to the church is he's saying, what you should feel is that feeling is, if you've ever been out of the country, gone to a faraway country,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   you get off the plane, you walk off the airport, and you're just hit with a whole lot of difference.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   You don't really understand the language that people are speaking.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   You don't understand the food that people are eating.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   You don't understand where everyone's trying to get to because you don't really know where anything is.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   You just kind of feel lost there.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   What Peter's saying here is he's saying, that's how we should feel as believers on this earth.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   We should frequently feel lost here because our home is not here.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   And it's not just Peter that says this, but Paul says this elsewhere in Philippians chapter 3, verse 20.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   He says, "Our citizenship is in heaven because we're just foreigners here."
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   So we should not understand the language of this world.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   We should not understand the way people speak.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   We should not understand what this world consumes.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Be it alcohol or entertainment or drugs. We shouldn't understand what the world consumes.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   We shouldn't understand where the world's trying to get to.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Whether they're trying to climb the ladder at their career, whether they're trying to get into a certain neighborhood,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   or whether they're trying to get into a certain social status.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   We shouldn't understand what everyone's trying to do here because here is not our home.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   We should feel lost here.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Because when we're foreigners here, we don't do as the world does.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And when we don't do as the world does, this world will treat you like outcasts.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   This world will look at you and it will treat you like an absolute loser.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   This world will look at you and tell you that you are unwanted.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   This world will look at you and tell you that you are unenjoyable.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   This world will look at you and tell you that you are unsuccessful.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   And that's okay because we're not living for their approval.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   We're living from His approval.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Because we're the elect exiles for crying out loud.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   We're chosen by Him so we know we're not going to be chosen by this world.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   So whenever you look at the world and the decisions that they make,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   it should feel like they're living by a different playbook.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   It should feel like the world is taking different orders than we are.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Because they are.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   You see, the world takes its orders from the prince of darkness.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   We take our orders from the king of kings.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Of course we feel lost here.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   So point number one, the first thing we can learn, your name,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   I hope you get this ingrained in your bones,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   is that in Jesus we are elect exiles.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   That's who you are.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Let me show you what that means for you in verse 3.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   It says this.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   In His great mercy He has given us a new birth into a living hope
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil, or fade.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   And this inheritance is kept in heaven for you."
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Okay, so why does your name matter?
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Well, let's imagine that my name was not Nate Hilgenkamp,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   but instead it was Nate Bezos or Nate Musk or Nate Zuckerberg.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   If that was my name, what could you conclude about me?
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   I'm rich. That's right.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   You'd be able to conclude that I have access to all my dad has,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   and one day I'm going to receive an absolutely massive inheritance.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Because, you see, your name means something.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   In this passage, in verse 3, it says that you've been given a new birth.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   And when you've been given a new birth, you've been born into a new family.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   When you've been given a new family, you've been given a new name.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   You see, our name isn't just Nate Hilgenkamp, elect exile,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   but it's now Nate Hilgenkamp, child of God.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   What does that mean?
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   It means I've got access to all my father has, which is point number two.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Second thing we can learn from this passage.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   In Jesus, we are given an imperishable inheritance.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   So what does that mean?
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Let's talk about this for a minute.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   The text says we're receiving an imperishable inheritance.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Do any of you remember NFTs?
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Yeah, they were a big deal when we were all, like, bored at home during COVID.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   And if you don't know what an NFT is,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   an NFT is like a screenshot of the Internet that you can buy.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   And I know for you crypto bros it's more than that,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   but it's not more than that.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   And let me tell you about one NFT.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Here's a picture of one.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   This is an NFT of the first ever tweet from Jack, the guy who founded Twitter.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   And I just took a screenshot of this, but apparently someone else owns it.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   And they bought it in 2021 for $2.9 million.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   $2.9 million.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   A couple years later, really not all that long ago,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   he put it up for sale and had the bidding for the auction start at $48 million.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   So the bidding went on, and at the conclusion of the bidding,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   the highest bid that he received was $280.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Not $280 million, $280.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   You see, what he did with this investment is he poured $3 million
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   into a depreciating asset.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   Almost as soon as he purchased this thing, this thing became worthless
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   because this thing perished, spoiled, and faded.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Now, can you even imagine making an investment like that?
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Of course you can.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Because some of you are doing that right now.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Maybe not with your finances, maybe you haven't bought an NFT,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   but Scripture says that whenever you invest your life in this world,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   this world is going to leave you bankrupt.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Your career is going to leave you empty.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Your social status is going to leave you empty.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Your net worth is going to leave you empty.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   It will perish, spoil, and fade.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   But on the other hand, Scripture says here that our heavenly Father
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   has an inheritance for us that can either perish, spoil, or fade.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   That means it's not going anywhere.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   That means the economy can't touch it.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   That means your performance can't touch it because God is holding it in his hands.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   And there's going to be a day either when Jesus comes back
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   or you die and go be with him, and he's going to give you all that he has.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   And that's good news.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   And that should be a relief for us.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   But many times it's not.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Like you ever think about that?
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Like why don't you think about that every single day?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Like if you knew that you had an inheritance coming that was $100 billion,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   wouldn't you not be as stressed about paying your rent this month?
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Like if you knew what was coming,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   wouldn't you be a little bit less anxious, a little bit less stressed?
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   And many times we're not, and I don't know.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Maybe it's because you don't actually believe it.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   I know for many of us here in this room, we are Christians.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   We claim to be followers of Jesus.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   But let's just look at the text one more time.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   This is what it says in verse 3.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   It says that the Christian is the one who has been given a new birth.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   You must be totally reborn.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   You're not an updated version of the old you.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   You're an alive version of the dead you.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   And then it says you've been given a new birth into a living hope.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Now here's where we need to wake up.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   For many of us, we've been lulled to sleep, thinking we're Christians.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   Meanwhile, we put our hope into things that are dying.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Or maybe for you, the thing that you hope more than anything else happens this year,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   like your deepest desire for this year,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   your hope is that this would be the year you get into a relationship.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   Or maybe for you, your hope is that one day you'd finally be an executive at your company.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   That's your hope.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Or maybe for you, your hope is that one day you'd be able to afford that car or those clothes.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   And I just want you to know, if that's you, you have a dying hope, not a living hope.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   And if that's you, and if you claim to be a follower of Jesus, I just want to say that's confusing.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Because if you are living this life for this life,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   it makes it look like you don't believe in the next life.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Because you see, on the other hand, what this text says is it says that the Christian has a living hope.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   So what does that mean?
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   That means you've placed your hope in something or someone that is alive and cannot die.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Well, who would that be?
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   The text says this, verse 3,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   "You have a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   That means you've not placed your hope in the things of this world.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   That means you've placed all your eggs in the basket of Jesus.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   You've placed all your hope in the fact that Jesus came and lived a life you couldn't live.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   He died a death that you deserve to die.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   And then he rose again so that death no longer has mastery over him,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   and so that it might no longer have mastery over you.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And friend, when you believe in that,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   God doesn't just raise Jesus from the dead, but he raises you from the dead.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   He brings you from death to life,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   and you've been reborn, as the text says, into a new family where you've received a new name.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   And with this new name comes an inheritance.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   It comes with all your father has.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   Well, what does he have?
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   What did Jesus Christ accomplish on this earth?
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   He defeated death so that he could have eternal life for all of us.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   That's what he has, and that's what he's eager to give you.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   That's your inheritance as a follower of Jesus.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   That's the second thing we can learn from this passage.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Point number two, in Jesus we have an imperishable inheritance.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Now, that's a large benefit.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   I want to tell you another benefit we have as elect exiles.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Let's read the end of verse 4, and then we're going to read verse 5.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   It says this.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   "This inheritance is kept in heaven for you,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   who through faith are shielded by God's power
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time."
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Now, this right here is one of the most important parts of Peter's teaching,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   because he's saying we make it to our salvation not because of who we are,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   but because of who he is.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Because if you've got your Bibles open, like look at the text.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   What does it say?
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   It says, "We make it to the coming of our salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time."
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Now, by the shielding of God's power.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   It's not about your power.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   It's about his, and this is the third thing we can learn from this passage.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   Point number three, in Jesus we are shielded by God's power.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Now, I think this is the best way I can describe it.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   This summer our family went to Branson, Missouri.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   We got to spend a week at Canica, which is just a great ministry.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   As a part of that time at the family camp, we got to go on the Lake Tanticoma,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   which is really more like a river.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   In fact, I've got a picture of it here.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   I was on the boat with my wife and my, at the time, like 2-year-old daughter.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   And Branson's a weird place for so many reasons.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   And one of those reasons is this lake, because this lake pulls its water from another lake,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   the Table Rock Lake, and it pulls its water from the bottom of another lake.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   So this water is like always freezing.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   If you could actually put the picture up again, there's a fog on the lake at all times,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   because in this picture it was really, really hot outside.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   It was like 95 degrees and humid, but the water was, I don't know, 35 degrees or something like that.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   And so there's always this fog on the water.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   So even though it's really, really hot outside, when you're on the water, it's actually really, really cold.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   And we'd been driving around on this boat for a while, and I don't know if it was a mile or so,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   and we were having a great time until we stopped having a great time,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   because my 2-year-old daughter lost her mind.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   And when a 2-year-old loses their mind, like there's really no way of fixing it,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   because she just kept going, "Dad, I'm cold! I want to get off the boat!
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   I want to get off the boat! Take me back! The wind's in my face, Dad! I'm cold!"
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   And so I'm like, "Okay, we've got to get off this boat, but we've got a ways to go."
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   So I asked the driver if he could turn around and go back to camp, and he's like, "Yeah, no problem."
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   But it still was like a ways back, and she wasn't calming down,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   because we kept driving, the wind's still in her face, and she just keeps going,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   "Dad! I want to get off the boat! I'm so cold! Get me out of here!"
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   And so eventually, as her dad, I went over to her, I picked her up,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   and then I placed her in front of me, and I put my back up against the wind.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And over and over again, for 20 minutes, I kept saying,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   "JC, we're almost back! We're going to make it! Dad's going to keep you safe!"
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   And I did my best to block the wind, I just kept saying over and over again,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   "JC, we're almost back! We're going to make it! Dad's going to keep you safe!"
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   You know, life's hard. I don't know what you've been through.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   I can tell you what I've been through. I could give you a number of examples,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   but just about 13 months ago, my wife and I, we had a miscarriage, and it was so hard.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   And in that time in my life, it just felt like the winds of this world were blowing straight in my face.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   You want to know what else I felt? I felt my Heavenly Father pick me up,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   turn His back to the wind, and say, "Nate, we're going home! You're going to make it! Dad's going to keep you safe!"
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   I don't know what you've been through in your life. I bet you've been through some really hard things.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   But I just want you to know that if you're a believer in Jesus, even in those moments when it feels like the wind is blowing at your face,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   your Heavenly Father is there picking you up, turning His back towards the wind and saying,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   "Son, daughter, you're going to make it! We're headed back! Dad's going to keep you safe!"
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   And I know that tonight, I'm in Dallas, Texas. We're in a room full of highly competent people.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Dallas is filled with really gifted people, really successful people, really strong people.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Dallas is all about what you can achieve. Like, I've got to go achieve this in my career.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   I've got to go achieve this social status. I've got to go out and get what's mine by my own strength.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   Friend, I just want you to know, there will be times in your life when the winds of this world will be stronger than you are,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   and it will blow you onto your back, and you won't have the strength to get up.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   The good news of Scripture is, you don't make it home on your own strength.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   You make it home by your Father's shielding.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   And I just want you to know tonight, the lie of Dallas, Texas, is that you have to go out and make a name for yourself.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   You have to go out and prove yourself.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   The truth of Scripture is, you don't need to prove anything, because your salvation is not dependent upon you.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Your sanctification is not dependent upon you. Your stability is not dependent upon you.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Your safety is not dependent upon you, because your life is not about you.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Because let me just show you what it says right here in the text, over and over and over again.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Listen again to the words used in this passage. It says, in verse 1,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   "To God's elect, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   and in His great mercy, He has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   And this inheritance is kept in heaven for you, who through faith are shielded by God's power."
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   You see, all of that is describing God's preeminence, and not your performance.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   And friend, this is the joy in following Jesus.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Your name is not dependent upon what you do.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   You don't receive a name because you've earned it.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   You don't receive a name because you deserve it.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   Because in Jesus, you are not defined by your net worth.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   In Jesus, you are not defined by the car you drive.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   In Jesus, you are not defined by your physical appearance.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   In Jesus, you are not defined by your career.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   In Jesus, you are not defined by your social status.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   In Jesus, you are not defined by the clothes you wear.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   In Jesus, you are not defined by anyone else.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   In Jesus, you are not defined by your sin.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   In Jesus, you are not even defined by you, because in Jesus, you are defined by Jesus.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   And scripture makes it very clear that He's declared you to be His son or daughter.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   And if that's who He says you are, then that's who you are.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   [Applause]
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Not because you've earned it, because you deserve it,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   but because He's declared it to be true.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And friend, I just want you to know,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   you don't have to go out and make a name for yourself, because He's already given you one.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   So in summary, three things we can learn.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   Point number one, in Jesus, we are elect exiles.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Point number two, in Jesus, we have an imperishable inheritance.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   And point number three, in Jesus, we are shielded by God's power.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   Now, this book, 1 Peter, was written by Peter.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Maybe you don't know a whole lot about Peter, but let me just tell you a little bit about his life.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Peter was not actually his name given to him at birth.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   His birth name was Simon.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   And he was named Simon and lived his life.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   And then eventually Jesus came and found him and said, "Follow me."
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   So Simon left everything and he followed Jesus.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   And then after they started doing ministry for a while, Jesus pulled him aside and He said,
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   "Simon, I'm going to rename you.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   Your name is no longer Simon, but your name is now Peter.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   And on this rock, I will build my church."
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   And then there's a really important moment in the Gospels where Jesus was arrested
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   and He's standing before Pontius Pilate.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   And at that moment, Peter, perhaps his closest friend, was found right by a fire.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   And maybe you know this story, maybe you don't.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   But when his best friend was arrested, when his best friend was about to die,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   he was there watching from a distance.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   And three separate times, people came up to him and said, "Hey, do you know him?"
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   And he said, "No, I don't know that man."
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   And then they said, "Man, it sure seems like you know him.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   You talk a lot like him. Do you know him?"
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   And he says, "Surely I do not know him."
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   And then a third time, someone said, "Do you know him? I saw you with him."
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   And he says, "No, I don't know that man."
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   And then the rooster crowed.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Then Jesus left that place, was crucified, died, and resurrected.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   And one of my favorite stories in the Gospel,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Jesus comes and finds his friend on the other side of the resurrection.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   And Peter's going out fishing, and Jesus appears on the sand,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   and Peter leaves the boat to go and find Jesus.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   And I noticed this, really, this moment for the first time
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   as I was rereading it, putting together this message.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   I've read this story a lot, but I was struck by one thing in this moment.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   This moment's typically called the restoration of Peter.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   And what Jesus does here is he approaches Peter,
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   and he says something interesting.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   He says, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   And Peter says, "Lord, you know I love you."
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   And Jesus once again says, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   And Peter says, "Lord, you know I love you."
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   And then a third time, Jesus says, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   And Peter says, "You know I love you, Lord."
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   And I was just struck by that moment because I was struck by the name
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   that Jesus spoke over Peter.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   He called him Simon, his worldly name,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   the name that was given to him by his parents,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   not the name that was given to him by Jesus.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   And Jesus always does something for a reason.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   And I think perhaps Jesus was going to Peter that day and saying,
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   "Who are you going to be?"
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   Because recently you've been living a whole lot like Simon.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   You've been living like the name this world has given you,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   but I've given you another name.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   So, Simon, who are you going to be?
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Who are you going to listen to?
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Well, from that moment on, the rest of the Gospels and the book of Acts,
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Simon would go by the name Peter, and he'd live like he was Peter.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   I think you've got an opportunity tonight.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   So I think your Heavenly Father may be asking you, "Who are you going to be?"
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   What name are you going to listen to?
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Because recently you've been living a whole lot like that name this world has given you,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   but I've given you a different name.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   So, son, daughter, who are you going to be?
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   Are you going to continue to go by the name unenjoyable, unsuccessful,
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   unwanted, broken, forgotten?
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Or are you going to go by the name that I've given you,
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   loved, chosen, seen, forgiven, accepted?
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   Which name are you going to go by?
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Who are you going to be?
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   Or maybe a better question is, who are you going to listen to?
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   Are you going to listen to the voices in this world,
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   or are you going to listen to the victorious voice of your Heavenly Father?
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   Who are you going to listen to tonight?
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Let me pray that it would be Jesus.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   Father, I am just so grateful that you know all of us by name,
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   that you know us even before we were formed in our mother's womb.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   And, God, I just thank you that you have given us a name
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   that we don't feel like we deserve.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   I know there's a lot of people in here tonight, watching tonight,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   and they feel covered in shame.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   They feel covered in sin.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   And they feel like they don't measure up to any name you've given them in Scripture.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Father, would you just remind us tonight that we don't earn our name,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   but we receive our name.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   Our name is not given to us because of what we've done in our life,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   but because of what Jesus did in his life.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   And he lived the perfect life we couldn't live.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   He died the death we deserve to die.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   And he rose again victoriously so that he could bestow on us a new name,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   so that he could bestow on us an imperishable inheritance,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   and so that you could block us,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   so that you could shield us from the winds of this world that want to take us out.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   And, God, I just pray for all of my friends here in this room,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   I pray that we make it home with you.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   I pray that every single day we wouldn't fall in love with the things of this world,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   but we'd fall in love with you.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   Not just having a mindset of, okay, I've got to choose Jesus,
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   I've got to choose Jesus, I've got to choose Jesus,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   but instead having a mindset of, I cannot believe he's chosen me.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   And, God, what we want to do tonight is we want to worship you like we've been forgiven.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   We want to worship you like we've been renamed.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   We want to worship you like we're alive because we are, because of what you've done.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Because the only reason we've got hope tonight is because of one thing.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   It's because Jesus is alive and with us and for us, and it's in his name we pray.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   Amen.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   Well, Ports, I know a lot of you have come in with a lot of different things,
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   and I just want you to know we've got a team up front who are eager to talk to you and pray with you,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   but what we want to do now is we want to worship our risen king.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:48.840]   Do that now.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.420]   (upbeat music)
