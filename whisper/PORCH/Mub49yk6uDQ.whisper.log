[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.120]   - All right, how's it going?
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.120]   (congregation cheering)
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.200]   Hey, I don't know if we have met before,
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.120]   unfamiliar face, my name is Graham Shelby.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.480]   I serve on the leadership team here at the Porsche.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.240]   I am so excited to be with y'all tonight.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.680]   So if you're tuning in here
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.400]   with those who are seated around us in Houston, El Paso,
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.840]   Chicago, for some of my friends,
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.000]   or wherever else you are tuning in,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.860]   we are so excited for you to be here tonight.
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.700]   Hey, I got a quick question.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.840]   Has anybody moved recently?
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.000]   Anybody moved recently?
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.080]   Right, it's the summer season, people are in transition,
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.500]   leases are coming up.
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.160]   If you have a truck,
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.540]   you just went up like three levels in popularity
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.000]   with your friends to becoming the best friend ever, right?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.120]   'Cause now your truck is being used to move every couch
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.720]   in your friend group across, right?
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.360]   So let me tell you a story.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.640]   I have moved three times in the last four years,
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.720]   three times in the last four years.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.000]   And really when I was moving,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.400]   I went through what I think all of us go through, right?
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.600]   Which is I have to start chasing my mail.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.960]   I have to start chasing my mail
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.360]   because I'm changing my permanent address.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.880]   And so I'm trying to keep up
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.120]   with telling all of the necessary parties
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.620]   of where you need to send me the relevant mail.
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.840]   And then now I'm trying to sift through all of the mail
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.720]   that seems to be following me that's not my own.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.240]   You tracking with me on that?
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.740]   So recently, not recently, after college,
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.000]   I moved to Chicago.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.320]   Moved to Chicago for a school teaching job.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.840]   And I moved in to an apartment
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.960]   with three other guys that I met.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.080]   And so we get this apartment, we start living together.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.280]   And of course we get our mail.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.240]   And as we're picking up our mail in the first few weeks,
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.560]   I'm noticing my name, all the other people's names.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.720]   And then we're noticing this one name that's like,
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.280]   who is this name?
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.480]   And her name's Katie Romero.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.720]   And all of a sudden we get some letters
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.840]   and we're like, ah, that's not me.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.320]   But then we start to get a lot more things
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.720]   that are addressed to Katie.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.320]   Like we start getting Bed Bath & Beyond coupons.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.240]   And we're like, okay, cool.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.720]   I don't really know, that's not for me,
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.020]   but I'll take it, I guess, right?
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.440]   And then it starts to become an educational process.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.140]   Like we start getting these things called Sephora ads.
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.920]   I don't know, I have no idea what that even is,
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.200]   but I started to learn what cosmetics were all about.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.600]   And I was like, okay, cool, Sephora,
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.240]   that's not relevant to for teachers
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.880]   that are living in Chicago.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.960]   I mean, then we're getting things
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.640]   like Planet Fitness membership letters.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.040]   We were like, man, who is this Katie Romero?
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.080]   And we started to get, I mean,
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.320]   we literally got in the mail one time
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.720]   of Victoria's Secret Magazine.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.220]   And we were like, man, I don't know if Satan
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.960]   is behind the United States Postal Service,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.760]   but we were experiencing some major spiritual warfare
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.720]   because that's not me, right?
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.140]   This is not who it's supposed to go to.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.040]   And I think for many of us in the room tonight,
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.900]   for being honest, when we hear about the topic of generosity
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.640]   we think the same way.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.940]   When we hear someone talk about this concept
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.180]   of generosity and giving,
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.760]   sometimes our instinctive reaction is to say,
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.040]   hey, that message is not for me.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.640]   I think that's for someone else.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.600]   It's not a message for me.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.120]   And we think just like Sephora ads aren't applicable
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.960]   to a household of four guys.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.520]   We say, hey, at least not right now,
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.520]   the conversation of me giving away things
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.160]   is not relevant to my life as a young adult.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.680]   I think the reason we feel this way is threefold.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.920]   First off, some of us are sitting in the room here tonight
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.200]   and we say, hey bro, this is your first time here.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.160]   You may not know me, but I have student loan debts.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.320]   Did you know that the average student loan debts
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.240]   is $40,000?
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.920]   I'm working a double job.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.720]   I have debt that I'm paying.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.780]   I can't be generous right now.
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.800]   I don't think you get it.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.160]   I'm trying to pay rent and just get by.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160]   Generosity, great concept.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.520]   Thanks for teaching, not for me.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.800]   Other people in the room tonight may say,
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.840]   hey, I don't think you realize,
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.360]   at least for those live here, that we live in Dallas.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.020]   Like have you realized that the average vehicle
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.020]   driving on the roads right now is a Range Rover
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.760]   and I drive a 20 year old Camry?
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.200]   It's not making sense.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.440]   The standard of living that I am trying to catch up to
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.460]   and that I'm trying to achieve
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.520]   is not one that I currently have.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.420]   And so as I try to elevate my standard of living
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.680]   and chase after that,
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.280]   then I'll be able to elevate my standard of giving,
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.760]   but not right now.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.960]   And I think the last group of us,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.020]   we'd say, hey, thanks for sharing this,
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.040]   but I think I'm generous already.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.220]   Thanks for presenting that idea,
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.520]   giving me that piece of mail,
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.600]   but it's not addressed to me because, bro, I'm generous.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.720]   You know, I give good birthday presents
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.000]   and I give to that one guy at one time.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.440]   And so thank you, but pass your note along to someone else.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.540]   And I think I'm exempt from that
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.360]   because of some perceived percentage, standard or amount.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.720]   And I'll just be honest with you guys.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.700]   We don't know each other
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.500]   because I haven't communicated here ever,
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.660]   but God over these last few weeks has grown my heart truly.
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.900]   God over these last few weeks,
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.340]   as I've been studying the scriptures
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.900]   on what it means to be generous,
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.180]   God has grown my heart.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.820]   He has wrecked my heart on this topic
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.140]   because I showed up
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.340]   and I would have thought the last thing.
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.060]   I would have thought, you know, I think I'm pretty generous.
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.700]   I think I do a pretty great job
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.460]   of giving myself my resources away.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.320]   But as I looked at what God's word said,
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.980]   I realized I don't think I'm as generous
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.420]   as I thought I was.
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.340]   I don't think I'm generous at all,
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.260]   according to what God says.
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.560]   And it's not because I don't make enough money.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.340]   It's because I don't fully grasp what God has done for me
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.020]   and his intention for my life.
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.180]   And I realized that I wasn't stealing from God
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.460]   as much as my lack of generosity was stealing from me.
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.620]   And I say that in full sincerity.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.140]   And I'll elaborate that on a little bit later,
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.460]   but you need to know
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.500]   that you don't have some field expert,
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.580]   prodigy in generosity speaking to you tonight.
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.020]   You have a peer under construction,
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.860]   growing in obedience to this concept.
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.120]   And I'm excited to tell you what I've learned so far.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.140]   I'm excited to tell you how God's shaping
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.620]   and reshaping my heart.
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.820]   And I'm excited to tell you who God is
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.780]   and challenge you and call you to an abundant life
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.060]   that he would have for you.
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.940]   The Bible says that generosity,
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.440]   if you and I are unable to practice it
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.140]   and experience it, it's going to rob you
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.260]   both in this life and the next.
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.980]   And there's no better time to be generous than right now.
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.260]   And most of you, when you hear that,
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.340]   all you think about is money.
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.660]   Church just wants my money.
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.300]   God just wants my money.
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.580]   And it's so much more than money.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.180]   And if we don't understand what true generosity is,
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.300]   we're gonna miss out on the true life
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.940]   that God has intended for us.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.620]   And so tonight we're gonna look specifically
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.740]   at this idea of generosity
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.140]   and we're gonna continue it in the series,
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.260]   "The Remnant."
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.980]   And we're gonna look at three things
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.520]   that it relates to this idea of generosity.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.320]   The first one comes from Acts chapter four.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.160]   So if you have a Bible,
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.740]   you can follow along in the book of Acts.
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.640]   It's in the New Testament.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.740]   Acts is the book that talks specifically
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.420]   about the birth of the church, the remnant,
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.180]   the early church that immediately follows
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.340]   the life of Christ.
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.960]   And in chapter four, we get a really, really good picture
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.820]   at how this remnant operated.
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.220]   And so in chapter four, verse 32, follow along.
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.860]   Now, the full number of those who believed
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.340]   were one heart and soul.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.180]   And no one said that any of the things
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.940]   that belonged to him was his own,
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.860]   but they had everything in common.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.860]   And with great power, the apostles were giving
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.540]   their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.700]   And great grace was upon them all.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.060]   There was not a needy person among them,
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.180]   for as many as were landowners or had houses,
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.340]   they sold them.
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.700]   And they brought the proceeds of what was sold
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.260]   and they laid it at the apostles' feet.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.860]   And it was distributed to each as any had need.
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.180]   My first point from the text tonight is this,
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.420]   that true generosity marks the people of God.
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.300]   True generosity marks the people of God.
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.780]   It's so easy for us to glaze over what I just read
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.500]   and to not think and understand how that practically
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.540]   plays itself out and just how insane that lifestyle was.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.740]   Like I'm in commercial real estate.
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.060]   I work in the commercial real estate industry.
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.900]   I don't think I've ever come across someone
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.460]   who was like, yeah, I own this building
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.740]   and I'm just gonna give it away.
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.380]   I'm just gonna sell it and give it to that guy.
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.700]   And actually just take the money
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.860]   and just give it to the church.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.180]   My mom, she's a realtor.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.980]   She helps people buy and sell homes.
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.460]   I don't think she's ever come across someone
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.860]   who's like, yeah, we're just gonna sell our home.
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.660]   No, we're not looking to expand.
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.980]   We're not looking to get another second story
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.100]   or another house for our car.
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.980]   We're just gonna sell it
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.100]   because we follow this guy named Jesus.
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.740]   And we know this guy named John and he was in need
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.220]   and we just thought it was our job to care for him.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.700]   And so we're selling our house
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.740]   and we'll all go live in an apartment.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.340]   And that's crazy, right?
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.860]   You don't hear that happening in our world today.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.580]   And that's how it was.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.100]   They were selling the things that they had.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:32.940]   I mean, you think about it,
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.900]   Jerusalem, they weren't known for their lake houses
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.620]   back in that day, right?
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.980]   They weren't known for their second and third homes.
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.580]   These people weren't giving out of excess.
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.220]   They were giving their essentials,
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.300]   the things that were necessary for them to operate
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.820]   and function out of their daily and normal lives.
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.580]   And if any of this happened today in church,
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.660]   it would make news, front page news, right?
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.060]   I mean, if people today were like,
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.860]   guys, we're all gonna get the same bank account.
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.700]   Hey, what's your name?
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.540]   I'm Graham.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.360]   Nice to meet you, Jerry.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.200]   Yeah, okay, cool.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.300]   And like, we're gonna put all our funds together.
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.300]   Yep, we're doing it.
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.780]   Like that would be called a cult.
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.940]   People would say that's a cult.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.460]   And it's so radical.
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.500]   It just doesn't make sense
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.620]   to our American individualistic mindset
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.460]   that's so focused on the word mine and not the word ours.
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.380]   And we just don't understand community.
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.700]   I mean, we look at that and we say,
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.780]   that's irresponsible at least.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.680]   And we say that that is flat out stupid at most.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.420]   And yet, that's the way the people of God thought.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:45.420]   They said, everything that we own is not our own.
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.600]   Everything that we have is not our own.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.800]   And they said, hey, we're not meant to be a reservoir,
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.640]   but a river.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.280]   And what I mean by that is we're not meant
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.460]   to just be an accumulator of things
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.160]   that just accumulates more and more stuff,
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.040]   but we're meant to be a funnel
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.600]   through which the things that we have
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.640]   just flows through our hands consistently
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.520]   to give to those in need.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.160]   They just said, we're gonna be a river.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.000]   And that's insane.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.640]   And some of you tonight may be sitting there and say,
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.440]   all right, let's just address the reality of this.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.040]   It sounds like that's socialism.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.200]   Okay, sounds like what they're doing is socialism.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.040]   Here's the difference.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:29.040]   This is not government mandated socialism, all right?
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.720]   This was people that were moved.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.440]   They were motivated to do this.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.680]   They weren't forced to do it.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.640]   They said, we're moved by something, by someone,
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.280]   and we're gonna give everything
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.160]   so that all of us have everything in common
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.840]   and there is no needy person among them.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.720]   And it marked them.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.840]   This last weekend, I traveled to Gulf Shores, Alabama,
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.840]   a road trip with four other friends
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.800]   who I went to college with,
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.440]   and we went east and went to Gulf Shores, Alabama.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.920]   You know how you can identify someone
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.920]   who is from Gulf Shores, Alabama?
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:08.440]   By their Southern accent and their mullet.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.960]   And I'm just kidding.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.800]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.000]   But I mean, not a comedian.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.840]   Thought that would work.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.560]   Anyways, but what, truly though,
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.480]   we were on the beach and we're like, man,
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.960]   I mean, you could tell immediately
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.720]   when people would open their mouths
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.520]   and you'd see three missing teeth.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.520]   I'm just kidding there too.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.520]   Just kidding there too.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.720]   Love Alabama, love Alabama.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.240]   No, but they would open their mouth
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.640]   and they'd speak and you'd hear this twang, right?
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.360]   You hear this Southern twang and you'd be like,
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.160]   I know where your home is.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.200]   I know where you're from.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.240]   And I'm not from that home, right?
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.240]   And in the same way, in the same way,
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.320]   people of God, just like the people of Alabama
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.600]   are marked by their accents,
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.560]   the people of God are marked,
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.560]   identified obviously by their radical generosity.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.340]   And you can tell where their home is.
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.720]   You can tell where they're from.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.400]   That it just doesn't make sense
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.560]   that they just might not be from this place
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.280]   and that they live in a way that's different.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:12.280]   I wanna ask you tonight, are you marked by generosity?
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.040]   Like if you thought about it
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.640]   and you had actually the courage to ask your friend
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.280]   who you came with and you said,
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.840]   hey, is generosity something that marks me?
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.680]   Like when you're describing me to people,
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.900]   are you just describing my hair color and how tall I am?
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.300]   Or is generosity a descriptive word
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.140]   or a concept that you would mention
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:39.100]   when you're telling others about me?
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.980]   Is generosity the fact that you are willing
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:46.760]   to give things away normal and in your life?
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.300]   The concept was so foreign to us,
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.220]   is so foreign to us of what the early church was like.
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.260]   It's almost like we just don't even have a category for it.
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.420]   But I think the reason why it's even more foreign
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.180]   is because we've lowered the bar.
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.500]   We've lowered the bar of generosity.
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.260]   I've asked people lately over this last month,
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260]   these three questions and I'd love to ask them to you.
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.100]   These are the three questions
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.220]   that I've asked people in conversation.
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.620]   I've asked coworkers, roommates, close friends,
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.540]   college friends, you name it, poor cheese.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.020]   All the people that on Tuesday,
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.420]   I will literally just ask people these questions.
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.100]   And it's this, do you think that you're generous?
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.260]   Question number one, do you think you're generous?
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.220]   Number two, do you think that others would think
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.940]   that you're generous?
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.100]   Question number three,
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:35.700]   do you think that God thinks that you're generous?
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.940]   And you know what's crazy?
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.060]   As I asked all sorts of different circles of people,
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.620]   I got similar answers, similar answers.
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.900]   Most people would say, generically, yes,
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.940]   I think I'm generous.
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.180]   I don't know whether or not
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.180]   I think my friends think I'm generous
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.980]   and probably not.
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:57.300]   I don't think that God thinks that I'm generous.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.740]   But here's what was even crazier
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.660]   is when I would ask why and I'd say,
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.740]   hey, why do you think that?
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.900]   The answers were insanely different
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.260]   in the logic that people will say,
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.940]   hey, this is why I think I'm different.
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.220]   See if you see yourself in any of these.
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.580]   Some answers that I got
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.980]   on why people thought they were different.
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.500]   I think I'm generous because I give more
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.260]   than the average person.
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.220]   According to what I know,
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.300]   I think I give a little bit more.
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.860]   I think I'm generous because I live on less means
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.260]   than other people, relatively.
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.140]   I save more than most people.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.380]   I think, you know, I'm a saver,
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:35.780]   so I spend less on myself.
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.060]   And so I think I'm generous because of that.
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.380]   Here's one of my favorites.
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.540]   I think I'm generous because I started doing
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.380]   my girlfriend's laundry.
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.700]   I literally had someone tell me that.
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.620]   I think I'm generous because I've started
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.140]   to do my girlfriend's laundry.
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:54.020]   I give great birthday presents.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.700]   I think that I'm generous because I am the best
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.580]   at giving great birthday presents
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.780]   on the birthdays that I remember.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.380]   I think that I'm generous because I walk
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.340]   my neighbor's dog sometimes.
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.540]   You know, like when they're out of town,
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.020]   like I'll walk him once or twice.
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:08.940]   I think I'm generous.
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.020]   I usually say yes when people ask for money.
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.220]   Or maybe this is you.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.540]   When I'm at CVS and they ask after I've purchased something
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.820]   if you'd like to donate a dollar,
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.340]   I always say yes, that's me.
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.300]   I always do that, right?
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.500]   And someone that was like, hey,
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.820]   when they always ask for that SPCA,
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.740]   like I help the stray kittens, I'm always there.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.940]   I say yes every time, saving it $1 at a time.
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.940]   That's me, I'm generous.
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.260]   And we look at what the Bible says, right?
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.740]   And they're giving fields, houses,
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.740]   their various essentials away,
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.340]   and we're doing laundry and we're calling it generous.
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.860]   And it's just like, man, maybe they aren't the crazy ones.
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:59.820]   Maybe they aren't crazy and for us to think
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.980]   that they were living a generous life,
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.860]   maybe we're the crazy ones and our standard is embarrassing,
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:06.820]   embarrassingly low.
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.260]   We're the richest people in all of human history
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.860]   by all historical accounts.
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:14.420]   And when we look at the first century church that was poor,
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:18.460]   it's like we're playing on a different scoreboard, right?
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:22.300]   Almost all examples that we have in reference
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.140]   to our generosity are giving in excess.
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.140]   And everything that they were doing was giving
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:33.140]   sacrificially out of need, out of what they had to live.
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.940]   And that's what marked them.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.140]   So what does it look like for you today in 2018?
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.180]   What does it look like for us to be generous,
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.900]   to give sacrificially?
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.580]   Let's look together at what Paul says
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.860]   to the words of Timothy, which are found in 1 Timothy.
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.460]   Chapter six, Paul says this,
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.220]   "As for the rich in this day, which is you and I,
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.980]   "by all historic accounts, even if you don't feel like it,
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.500]   "that's us.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.060]   "As for the rich in this day,
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.260]   "charge them not to be haughty,
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.820]   "nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches,
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:10.580]   "but on God, who richly provides us
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.580]   "with everything to enjoy.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.660]   "They are to do good, to be generous.
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.300]   "They are to do good, be rich in good works,
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.540]   "to be generous, ready to share,
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.620]   "thus storing up treasure for themselves
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.620]   "as a good foundation for the future,
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:29.620]   "so that they may take hold of that which is truly life."
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.620]   The second point from the text tonight is this,
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:35.700]   true generosity is about how you live,
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.820]   not just the money you give.
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.140]   True generosity is about how you live,
[00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.060]   not just the money you give.
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.180]   There are three categories that the Bible
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.860]   gives with how we're to be rich towards God,
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:52.860]   and that's with our time, our talent, and our treasure.
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:57.300]   Our time, our talent, and our treasure.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.300]   And so we'll start with our time.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.900]   We all have 24 hours in a day.
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.820]   We all seemingly have jam-packed calendars
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.140]   that need to be scheduled.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:10.020]   How can you give your time?
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.060]   Maybe it looks like leading a Bible study
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.900]   of college students this summer.
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.740]   Maybe it looks like giving your time on Wednesday nights.
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.860]   Like I know so many of you already do,
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:25.260]   to helping disciple junior high and high school students.
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.340]   Maybe it looks like getting involved
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.260]   in different parts of our city,
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.500]   like South Dallas at Mercy Street, mentoring kids.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:37.220]   How can you give your time that's not your own
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.700]   for other people generously?
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.860]   Let's look at talent.
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.540]   What unique experiences
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.420]   that only you have, giftings that only you have.
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.260]   We're at this stage of life
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.660]   where we probably have figured out
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.660]   whether we're good at singing or we're not good at singing.
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.300]   Whether we are gonna make it to professional sports or not.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.260]   Whether we had an engineering path
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.300]   or we just can't get it right with the numbers.
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.660]   And we know what we're good at
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.980]   and we know the experiences that we've alone been given
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.340]   that we can use and utilize.
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.460]   Maybe you're a nurse.
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.620]   Maybe you serve at Quest Care, at a clinic nearby.
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.740]   In a way that I never could as a real estate broker.
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.860]   Maybe you're an attorney
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.340]   and you partner with some of my friends at ACT
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.180]   and you help rewrite and reshape the judicial system
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.460]   in our city, here locally.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:31.260]   And help those who are unable to help themselves.
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:36.420]   Maybe you're like some of the artists here
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.860]   that have given their time
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.940]   to make everything that you see tonight,
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.300]   exceptionally great.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.580]   That you have no idea about.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.860]   You just got excited about that launch video.
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.100]   You just got excited about the bumper videos.
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.260]   All of the details that you see here.
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:53.300]   That's done by people who are paid to do that
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.860]   on a daily basis.
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.380]   And yet they're so sold out
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.380]   and they believe in the cause of Christ
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.660]   that they say, I wanna donate.
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.820]   I wanna give everything that I'm excellent at
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.740]   so that Jesus can be known
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.580]   and so that thousands can experience it.
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.860]   That's what people do here with their talent.
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.260]   What can you do?
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:16.060]   What do you have that you can give?
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:19.380]   And your treasure, somewhat self-explanatory
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.300]   and it goes without saying,
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.460]   but how are you distributing your money?
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.340]   How are you giving your funds to the kingdom of God?
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:31.340]   Are you giving your money to the kingdom of God?
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.780]   Are you actually doing it?
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:33.740]   Are you holding it?
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.700]   As I've said earlier,
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.220]   this is something that as I go through these things,
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.500]   when I went through these things,
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.620]   I thought I was generous and I kind of went in that order.
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.180]   And that's why I thought initially that I was generous
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.500]   because I said, you know what?
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.820]   I give my time.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.220]   I serve here.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.980]   I help out in different ways.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.140]   I give my time.
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.260]   I know what I'm gifted at and I give that freely
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.780]   and I love to do it and it fires me up.
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:00.940]   And so I'm generous.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.540]   And then that last part, treasure.
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:07.780]   And I said, I don't like to do that.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.300]   If I was speaking to my preferences and being honest,
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:15.020]   I would much rather give $10,000 worth of my time
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.620]   than $10,000 of my dollars.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.180]   I just don't wanna do it.
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:22.500]   It's the truth.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.820]   I just don't wanna do that.
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.600]   And here's the reality that I need to confess to you guys
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:32.600]   is that I let that preference bleed into a faulty priority.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.680]   That I, for the last year, just said,
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.080]   hey, because I do these things,
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.200]   because I give in these other ways,
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:45.000]   I am justified and exempt from giving financially.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.120]   That was me.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.360]   I neglected giving to this place
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.480]   because I said I already give of myself.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.420]   And so they don't need my dollars.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.480]   They already have my time.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.360]   And I wanna tell you, God wasn't missing out.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.640]   I was.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.160]   I was missing out.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.640]   For as much joy as it gives me to give my time
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.760]   and my talents, it gives me joy
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.240]   when I give my money as well.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.800]   I can tell you that where your treasure goes,
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.320]   your heart will go also.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.240]   I know that.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.560]   And yet for some reason, for some reason, for a long time,
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.920]   I said not here.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.520]   And I made excuses.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.200]   I made excuses.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.560]   And that changed this last weekend
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.000]   in Gulf Shores, Alabama, of all places.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.200]   I went with those friends and we talked about our money.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.320]   And we said, what do we have?
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.540]   And what are we doing with it?
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.440]   We asked the questions.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.280]   What are we gonna do with the money that God has given us?
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.000]   And I got to confess to my friends and say,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.520]   guys, I don't think I'm doing it right.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.240]   And it's not because I see that y'all are.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.820]   I see that God has given me so much
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.800]   and that for some reason there is a mistranslation.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.920]   That for some reason, I don't fully grasp who God is
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.000]   and the generosity He's given
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.360]   because I'm holding something back.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.960]   And I get to confess that.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.760]   And I got to make a change and make a plan
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.040]   and gather accountability and take a step
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:15.320]   and actually click the button and actually give dollars.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.160]   And we got to do that together.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.620]   And it was amazing.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.120]   So maybe you can follow that process.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.280]   Maybe it's not money, but it's anything else
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.040]   that if you're sitting here and you're like, man,
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.320]   I recognize that I am withholding something.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.400]   That God's not demanding, but He's asking,
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.520]   He's saying, if you want to live the abundant life,
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.600]   it's found through giving, not getting.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.320]   And maybe for you, if you are recognizing some area of that,
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.680]   a great next step is to gather people around
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.880]   and confess that.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.280]   And to say, I'm not living as I should.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.240]   I'm not living as I say I should.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.160]   And I want to tell you what's going on.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.200]   And I want to do something about it.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.200]   I want to change and gather accountability
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.180]   and lock arms with people that are going to help point you
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.140]   in a different direction.
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:06.900]   The reality is I didn't have a behavior problem
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:07.740]   this last year.
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.880]   I had a belief problem.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.120]   There was a fault in my belief that I didn't fully
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.840]   understand the goodness of God.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.040]   And so let's take a look at the why of generosity,
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.800]   the belief behind the behavior.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.560]   And it comes from 2 Corinthians 8, verse nine.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.320]   Paul is writing to this church in Corinth.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.360]   It's culturally like modern day Las Vegas.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.900]   He calls them to be, the church isn't,
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.560]   the city is where that church is.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.520]   And he calling them to be generous.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.520]   And this is what he says in verse nine.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.840]   He says, "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus,
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.880]   that though He was rich, yet for your sake, He became poor,
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:47.560]   so that you by His poverty might become rich."
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.520]   My last point tonight from the text is that true generosity
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.440]   is a response to God's generosity.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:59.440]   True generosity is a response to God's generosity.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.080]   Paul's point here is that because you know the generosity
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:07.780]   of Jesus, because of what He's done,
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.600]   He's associating our act with an act that's already been done
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.940]   before us and to us.
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:17.300]   He's saying the why of giving is because someone else
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.380]   has given to you.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.980]   You know what he does not say?
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:24.020]   He doesn't say you give to earn your way to heaven.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:27.060]   Bible doesn't say that.
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:30.140]   He doesn't say you give because it makes you feel
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:31.180]   really good.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.740]   Doesn't say that.
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:37.340]   It didn't say you give so that you get a tax write-off
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.640]   and a benefit financially.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.520]   He does not say that.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:47.900]   He says you give because of what Jesus has given to you.
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:52.220]   That God, very God of very God, became man.
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:56.180]   He took on human flesh and He gave you His very life.
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.460]   And in response to that, not as a requirement,
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:04.300]   but in response, you give your life freely to Him.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:09.900]   And so in summary, true generosity marks the people of God.
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:14.740]   True generosity is about the life that you live,
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.080]   not just the money that you give.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:22.080]   And true generosity is a response to God's generosity.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.860]   I wanna close with a story that I found
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.140]   that was just mind blowing to me
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.420]   that really relates to this third point
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.360]   and then the overall message.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.340]   It's about a guy two or three weeks ago,
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.260]   about a guy named James Harrison.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:38.060]   I don't know if you read it much about Australians,
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.960]   but this guy's an Australian guy.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.960]   And when he was a teenager in the '60s, 1960s,
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.440]   he had a life and death moment
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.040]   where he had to go into some really intense surgery.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.320]   Wasn't gonna make it.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.200]   They needed someone to donate blood.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.200]   And some anonymous person decided to donate their blood
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.280]   and it saved James Harrison's life.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.760]   He was so moved by that reality
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.700]   that someone he didn't even know
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.880]   would give their very life for his.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.980]   And so he said, man, I wanna give in response to that.
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:14.480]   I wanna give because someone's shown amazing kindness to me.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.600]   Shortly thereafter, there was a problem in Australia
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.400]   where a lot of the expecting mothers,
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.180]   pregnant women in the country,
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:25.960]   a part of the complications that were happening at that time
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.120]   these medical experts said,
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.820]   hey, I think your blood type, you have a unique blood type.
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:34.760]   And I think that it might be the solution to this problem.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.900]   Would you give that?
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.640]   And he said, absolutely.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.640]   And so he gave his blood once a week for 60 years.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.720]   60 years straight.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.640]   The only reason we know about this story
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.960]   is because two weeks ago, he retired from giving blood.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.200]   And it wasn't even because he chose to.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.320]   It was because by Australian law,
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.140]   you can't give blood past 81 years old.
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.440]   Insanity, right?
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.280]   Insanity.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.440]   And so they flip back and they say,
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.120]   man, this guy's given for how, 60 years.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.500]   How, every week.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.520]   Oh my gosh.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:14.680]   And they roll back the tape and they recognize and realize
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.400]   that James Harrison, through his blood donations,
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:22.400]   saved 2.4 million babies with his blood.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.840]   One of which was his own granddaughter.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.680]   And you listen to that and you're like,
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.320]   oh my gosh, it's amazing.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.820]   2.4 million lives, I could never do that.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.200]   Or you're like, 2.4 million lives,
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.840]   I wanna save that tomorrow.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.640]   I wanna do something great now.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.440]   I don't wanna wait 60 years when I'm 81 and old
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.840]   and boring, I wanna do that now.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:47.800]   And the reality is, it probably wasn't that sexy
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.560]   showing up every week, having your arm inserted
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:56.560]   with a needle and taking a little bit of blood.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.120]   It probably wasn't that impressive.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.760]   It probably wasn't that exciting,
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:05.600]   but consistent faithfulness over a long period of time,
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.040]   yielded an amazing impact.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:13.720]   And if you are impressed by an 80 year old man
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.840]   who saved 2.4 million babies because of his blood,
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.840]   then you need to know the man that has saved
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.160]   more than that by a long shot.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.680]   Offering salvation with his blood by a long shot.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.440]   Ultimate Jesus juke here.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.440]   But Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ came to earth
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:42.280]   and he came and he offered his life completely.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.760]   He lived a perfect life.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.560]   And he said, I wanna give it for people that don't know me
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.360]   and that won't respond to me.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.600]   I'm gonna give it to them anyways.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.200]   I'm gonna give them everything.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.240]   I'm not just gonna give some of my blood
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.000]   that's gonna be a benefit to them
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.400]   so that they can have a better life.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.080]   I'm gonna give my entire self
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.440]   so that they can live with me for eternity.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.360]   He offers that freely and he wants you to know him,
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.480]   not as a requirement so you'll feel guilty and obligated
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.680]   like you have to pay a God tax
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.460]   and give some of your money away,
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.520]   but so that you will experience the life
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.320]   that he intended for you,
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.940]   that you will experience the life of generosity
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.360]   that when you give,
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.520]   you will realize it's more blessed to do so
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.240]   than to receive.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.040]   And so my plea for you tonight
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.520]   is that for those who don't know that,
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.120]   that you would look at the cross,
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.400]   that you would look at Jesus and you would realize,
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.920]   man, there's something that that guy did.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.040]   And inside of my messed up brokenness,
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.960]   this guy pursues to know me
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.320]   and offers me more than the prestige of Dallas ever could
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:53.600]   or success in my 20s and 30s ever will.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:58.260]   And I want you to see the cross and see his generosity,
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.640]   that he is infinitely more generous
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.000]   than James Harrison ever will be.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.220]   And he offers that to you who he knows.
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.640]   And for those in the room tonight
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.720]   who do know that generosity,
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.160]   who do know that kindness that was shown to you,
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.960]   I hope that this motivates you.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.040]   I hope that this,
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.980]   that further just convicts and stirs your heart and says,
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.680]   man, I want to give more of myself.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:27.160]   I wanna be more of a river and less of a reservoir.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.040]   I don't wanna hold on to stuff anymore.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.640]   I wanna let it go through
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.800]   because that's what God's called me to.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.220]   That's the life that he's offered us,
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.600]   that he has died for.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.560]   Let me pray for us.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:45.320]   Thank God I pray for my friends.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.680]   I pray that we would know
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.400]   that there is nothing that we can do to please you.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.400]   There's no amount of money that we can give away
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.760]   that's gonna wow you.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.520]   You don't ask for money, God.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:06.120]   You want us to respond to your generosity.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.500]   You are the giver.
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.520]   It's not us, it's you.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.120]   So I pray for my friends in the room
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.680]   that they would know that generosity,
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.320]   that they would respond to it,
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.180]   that they would not do so in isolation,
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.600]   that they wouldn't just say, man,
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.320]   generosity is this lifestyle and virtue
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.520]   that I practice on my own.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.720]   I pray that they would realize
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.160]   that it is best practice in community.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:32.360]   And I pray that they would experience the fullness of life,
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.520]   that they would realize that it is better to give
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.200]   than to receive,
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.760]   and that things would change tonight,
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.640]   that plans would be made,
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.080]   and that action steps would be taken.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.300]   I pray that tonight.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.600]   It's your name we pray, all these things, God, amen.
