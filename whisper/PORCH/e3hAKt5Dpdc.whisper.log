[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:13.200]   - All right, here we go.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.940]   We are finishing up First Comes to Love tonight.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.660]   Welcome friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth,
[00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.400]   friends in Houston, aka the pennant winners,
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.380]   and all the friends around from Houston.
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.220]   I gotta get that out of the way.
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.620]   Astros never go to the World Series.
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.460]   All right, hey, tonight we're doing something different.
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.640]   We are wrapping up this series.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.560]   Inside of the series, we have covered
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.480]   a number of topics, what love does.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.680]   Ben Stewart kicked us off, we quote,
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.800]   "What love doesn't, what he must be, what she must be."
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.640]   The idea of what God's design for sex was,
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.460]   what to do while you wait, and a lot of the questions
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.720]   that we get any time we do a dating series are,
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.840]   hey, practically, what does it actually look like
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.000]   to date someone?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.600]   And so tonight, it is one thing to talk about it.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.560]   We are going to show you, and we are gonna take you
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.760]   from the ask-out to the altar and do this tonight.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.980]   We have two volunteers who are gonna be a part of this.
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.000]   Get excited.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.240]   Hopefully, you'll be excited in about 30 minutes
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.320]   once it's done, but our two volunteers
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.760]   are gonna come up right here.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.920]   This is Jacob Huss and Elena Anderson.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.400]   They're gonna come up and model for us.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.840]   They have volunteered to be a part of this.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.080]   And so Jacob is gonna play Romeo and Juliet,
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.720]   and they have been gracious enough to volunteer.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.640]   Elena's actually on our staff, so she didn't have a choice,
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.880]   but they're gonna play the role for us,
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.400]   and we're gonna set the scene real quick,
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.500]   and show you some of what to do
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.480]   and some of what not to do throughout the evening,
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.260]   but the first scene is gonna be the initial ask,
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.680]   the asking out.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.100]   And so in this scene, Jacob is gonna show us
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.940]   what not to do.
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.620]   He's not gonna text this girl that he's meeting
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.560]   for the first time.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.560]   Jacob, you can come up here.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.520]   You can get closer than that.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.360]   It's okay.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.600]   He's gonna show us what not to do originally.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.220]   So he's seen this girl.
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.120]   Maybe he bumped into her at the porch.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.160]   It's porch late night behind us.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.000]   - We got the scene going.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.960]   - They're the only ones here.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.720]   They're in the Welcome Town Center all by themselves.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.840]   It's security, but here we go.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.600]   He's gonna show us what to do or what not to do.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.440]   So Jacob, here we go.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.600]   Show us what not to do.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.000]   - Hey, random porch girl.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.720]   You wanna go on a date?
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.560]   - Okay, let me pause you right there.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.800]   Hey, we actually have to give this example
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.020]   because for whatever reason,
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.800]   there could be some gentlemen in this room
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.600]   who think we may be still in sixth grade at the mall.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.920]   Don't go up to a random girl and just say,
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.480]   hey, I don't even know your name,
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.040]   but can you give me your number?
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.320]   That's not the way to meet.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.240]   But there is a way to meet,
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.520]   where maybe you've been around a social circle
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.120]   and you've got to see and observe this girl from afar
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.960]   and you have expressed or taken an interest
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.280]   and maybe you've been serving
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.840]   alongside of one another at the porch.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.480]   And so Jacob's gonna show us maybe in that context
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.200]   what it would look like to make the initial ask out.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.640]   He's gonna use his words.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.080]   He's not gonna text.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.720]   He's gonna go up and show what that looks like.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.160]   Jacob, take it away.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.720]   - Hi, Elena.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.080]   I really enjoyed serving with you at the porch.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.160]   Would you like to get dinner next Tuesday?
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.000]   - No.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.900]   - He's not read these lines too,
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.960]   so that's why he's reading them.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.000]   He's been handed these cards.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.640]   Hey, and Elena, we'll have an option
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.960]   to respond with either a yes or a no.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.040]   Both could be valid options
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.200]   depending on the season of life.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.120]   Elena, what do we say to Romeo's inquiry?
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.720]   - I would say, sure, that sounds fun.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.960]   - Man, I love it.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.800]   Just like that.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.800]   The magic happens.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.240]   So he's clear.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.840]   He leads out by asking and initiating.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.320]   Men, ask, initiate.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.500]   A lot of the questions that we get is,
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.440]   is it okay for a girl to ask out a guy?
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.240]   Maybe, I don't know.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.440]   I mean, here's what, here's what Biblically,
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.600]   God created the world we're told
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.600]   and there was certain order and design that he put into it.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.920]   One of the ways that he ordered the world
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.200]   is that when it came to creation of man and woman,
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.600]   he set a design for men to lead and to initiate,
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.320]   to be the servant leaders.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.280]   And part of the ways that they serve and they initiate
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.120]   is by being the ones who ask out.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.000]   Is it wrong for a girl?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I don't know, but here's what I do think it does,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.460]   is it breeds passivity if the girl, from moment one,
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.480]   it breeds passivity in the man
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.120]   if she's the one driving and leading the relationship.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.040]   So it just may not be wise,
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.000]   though, I don't know, maybe it's okay.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.720]   Dating went around and the Bible's written,
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.720]   but we don't think it's wise or God's best.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.040]   So here we go, Jacob leads, he initiates,
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.680]   is in line with Ephesians five,
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.000]   and the date is begun.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.400]   All right, so here we go, fast forward seven days,
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.280]   here we are, they're at the date,
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.360]   you guys can head back to the date, seven days go by.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.560]   We're at a romantic dinner.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.280]   Maybe, maybe not quite as romantic, Billy.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.080]   Mexican, I love it.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.880]   All right, here we are,
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.160]   sitting down, enjoying some chips
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.880]   and a candle that won't light.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.160]   And here's what we're gonna show here.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.440]   Oftentimes, man, this is, you gotta listen to me here,
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.240]   this happens more often, what I'm about to explain
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.240]   happens more often than you would think,
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.480]   where guys will be overly intense
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.400]   and attempt to be intentional,
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.840]   especially, man, some of the porch men,
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.200]   I love you, but we can be the worst at it,
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.240]   where it will be like, hey, I'm gonna regurgitate
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.760]   a lot of what I heard of the porch
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.400]   and just kind of go into Christianese
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.080]   is the only thing that I speak at this moment.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.760]   And so the idea is to be intentional,
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.440]   but not overly intense.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.800]   So Jacob's gonna show us a little bit,
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.360]   what do I mean by overly intense?
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.680]   Jacob, take it away.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.680]   You just read the card.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.600]   - Elena, I just really want you to know that,
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.480]   really just one thing, I'm here to get married.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.480]   And truly, I think that you are the one,
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.080]   the one that I'm looking for.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.200]   I know there's no the one, whatever that is,
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.560]   and that I could marry, that I could make marriage work
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.840]   with any one of the millions of godly single women around.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.340]   But out of that group, I think you could be the one person
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.440]   that God has for me to spend my life with on earth.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.320]   Because we all know people aren't married in heaven.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.280]   We're on the same page on that, right?
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.120]   Also,
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.240]   and just out of curiosity,
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.040]   how many children do you wanna have?
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.340]   - Okay, this is not okay on date one or date 50.
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.400]   This is not the way that you wanna
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.440]   initiate the conversation.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.800]   It's overly intense.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.880]   Don't go into how many children you wanna have
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.720]   or anything of that sort.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.600]   Just making conversational, it's relaxed conversation.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.480]   Hey, where are you from?
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.340]   How many siblings do you have?
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.520]   What are their ages?
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.360]   Where do you work?
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.560]   What's your favorite part of your job?
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.000]   You don't have to do an interview.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And it's not just bombarding and not letting them talk,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.180]   but it's just making relaxed conversation,
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.960]   not being intense, but being intentional.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.440]   The Bible says Christians, in Colossians chapter four,
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.880]   verse six, are to be those whose speech
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.400]   is full of grace seasoned with salt.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.400]   Salt being like, man, it's appealing, it's appetizing.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.960]   I wanna hear more of that.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.440]   And so one of the ways that you can do this
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.600]   in a dating context is by not being overly intense,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.240]   but being intentional.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.240]   So here they are, the date went well,
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.200]   things wrapped up, they had good conversation,
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.520]   and it's over.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.640]   So they head home.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.920]   They head back to their respective apartments,
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.560]   wherever they live in this made up world.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.280]   And they head there and Jacob decides,
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.160]   man, I would really like to take this girl
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.600]   on a second date.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.120]   So he heads back to his room, he's sitting there,
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.880]   he's talking with his buddies,
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.680]   he decides I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna call and ask.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.820]   And Elena's gonna show us how to respond.
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:51.820]   So here we are in Jacob's room with a giant bean bag
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:59.880]   and Picasso's boxes everywhere, and he's playing Xbox.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.980]   And he's hanging over here, he's decided,
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.600]   I wanna ask Elena on a date.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.320]   Elena's gonna show us how to respond,
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.320]   'cause sometimes maybe you don't wanna go on a second date,
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.760]   maybe you do, how do you respond in those situations?
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.520]   Elena's over here, she's got her Pottery Barn mattress top
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.800]   or whatever this is, and she's hanging out,
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.480]   and Jacob all of a sudden calls.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.460]   Jacob, pick up that phone.
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.580]   Just hanging out in your apartment with your pastor.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:35.880]   - Oh, that's for me.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.560]   - Hey, Elena?
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.400]   - Hello?
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.840]   - Hey, I just wanna let you know
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.520]   that I had a great time with you
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.800]   and would love to take you on a second date.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.200]   Do you have plans this Friday night?
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.440]   - Okay, let me pause.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.640]   What do you do, sometimes it's, hey, yes,
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.480]   but what do you do?
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.520]   Sometimes you don't wanna go on a second date.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.040]   It was fun, it was whatever it was,
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.760]   but you're not really interested in moving forward
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.840]   and you don't wanna have a second date.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.880]   Elena's gonna show us what you don't do.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.720]   - Okay.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.760]   - Jacob, can you hit repeat?
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.960]   Call one more time.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.520]   Phone got dropped, or the signal dropped.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.800]   - Hello?
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.640]   - Hey, Elena.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.080]   - Hi.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.200]   - Hey, hey, I was just calling.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.240]   I just wanted to let you know
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.640]   that I really had a great time with you last week
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.840]   and I'd love to take you on a second date.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.160]   Do you have plans this Friday night?
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.640]   - I actually do.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:42.520]   - Well, what about Saturday night
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.120]   or maybe even next Friday night?
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.040]   - I actually have plans for the next five years.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:53.960]   And I think I'm gonna be called to be a nun, so.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.800]   My self-service is kinda sadic-y, gotta go, bye.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.840]   - Hello?
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.440]   No, that is not what you do
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.920]   if you wanna go on a second date.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.320]   You tell the truth.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.640]   You don't blame it on God.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.480]   You don't blame it on your community group.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.720]   You say the truth.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.960]   Hey, I'm not interested at this time
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.880]   in going on a second date.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.720]   We're Christians.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.240]   Ephesians chapter four, verse 15 says,
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.360]   "Christians don't lie.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.520]   "They speak the truth to one another in love."
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.720]   If you're not interested in going on a second date,
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.240]   you say that.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.280]   But let's say they were to go on a second date.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.000]   Maybe she was interested and she said yes.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.560]   She didn't say no at that time.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.960]   And so they go on a second date, things are going well.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.400]   Maybe they went to the fair together.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.520]   Nope, they didn't go to the fair.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.640]   Here they are.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.000]   Just at the ice cream shop with no feet.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.920]   And they're having a great time.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.360]   And all of a sudden, there are a few dates in
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.760]   and they've entered into the relationship zone.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.160]   And by the relationship zone, I mean this kinda,
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.200]   hey, where's this going?
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.560]   Where the friends are starting to go,
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.880]   what's up with you guys?
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.660]   And they've all of a sudden gotten to this place
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.080]   where Jacob, as the male, needs to remove confusion
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.800]   and do what has been called historically a DTR,
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.000]   a defining of the relationship.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.080]   So they're gonna have this moment where Jacob bleeds out
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.960]   and he removes confusion as the guy is supposed to do
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.360]   and give clarity on his intentions
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   or where he sees it going
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.320]   or maybe where he doesn't see it going.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.720]   And so oftentimes this will happen at night in a car.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.880]   You get done with the date
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.520]   or you get done hanging out at the ice cream shop
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.840]   and Jacob's gonna show us what to do
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.720]   and what this looks like.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.960]   So here we are, we're hanging out in the car.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.120]   Just, he opens the car door.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.120]   (audience cheering)
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.200]   That's just free.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.160]   Just.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:54.440]   In the car with your pastor again.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.560]   All right, Jacob.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.560]   So what does it look like to remove any confusion?
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.960]   Is that music?
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.360]   Can we turn the radio down here?
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.400]   And some air in the back, it's a little hot.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.400]   And Jacob, let's remove a little confusion
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.760]   on what it looks like and help define this relationship.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.120]   - So Elena, I would love to continue this relationship
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.080]   and continue to take you on dates
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.720]   and pursue you as my girlfriend.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.880]   - I'm not sure we read the line.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.720]   - I would like that, Jacob.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.560]   - Oh, you would? - Yes.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.560]   - Okay, well, I guess that's a W.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:40.480]   That was good, it felt a little stiff and a little,
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.200]   guys, I wouldn't write that down in the room.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.760]   You may wanna have some emotion attached to that idea
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.880]   of asking a girl to be your girlfriend in the future.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.600]   But you wanna do everything that you can
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.400]   to remove confusion.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.760]   If there's any mystery, if they're wondering,
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.800]   it is a failure on us as guys, as we're leading.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.440]   So whatever we can do to just telegraph,
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.760]   hey, this is where I am, this is where I see us going.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.920]   I'm not saying we're getting married,
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.720]   I just wanna continue to make this relationship deepen
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.280]   and exclusively pursue you.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.760]   Are you okay with that?
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.480]   And so do that in your own words,
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.880]   but bring as much clarity as you can.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.400]   Here's why I think this is so crucial.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.840]   'Cause we grew up, I grew up just like you,
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.760]   in a culture that says, hey,
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.560]   you wanna leave a little mystery.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.000]   You don't wanna just put it all out there.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.920]   You wanna leave 'em wondering a little bit.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.080]   If they text, don't respond too fast.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.840]   You don't wanna be seen as that person.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.720]   Leave a little mystery.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.480]   And the Bible says that as followers of Christ,
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.160]   particularly as a man leading,
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.000]   we are not to leave a little mystery.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.360]   That leaders remove confusion.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.320]   That the reason we leave mystery
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.040]   is 'cause we're kind of afraid of rejection,
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.360]   we're playing the game.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.880]   And it's not loving.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.000]   It's not serving, and it's not loving.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.760]   And it's honestly selfish.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.600]   And it's self-seeking.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.720]   And so the Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 13
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.800]   that, hey, love, by definition,
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.080]   is not self-seeking or self-preserving.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.040]   And so you cannot be self-preserving and be loving.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.160]   And so as men, it's incumbent on us
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.320]   to define the relationship, define where it's going,
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.160]   and bring as much clarity to it as we can.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.480]   And set expectations.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.120]   Communicate early and often.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.520]   Okay, so here we are.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.760]   They've become boyfriend and girlfriend.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.200]   They are in like, if you will.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.920]   And they find themselves, you know, a few months in maybe,
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.760]   and where oftentimes people can find themselves,
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.480]   maybe one of them thinks, man, I think we should break up.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.320]   And so what do you do?
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.600]   Do you just go submarineing,
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.960]   which is the term that I heard this week,
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.960]   where you just disappear
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.800]   and then all of a sudden resurface at some time?
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.560]   Do you just totally, that's pretty genius, actually.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.560]   Do you text them and say, it's over, sorry, emoji.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.640]   And what do you do?
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.880]   And so Elena's gonna show us what to do,
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.000]   which is in person, she's gonna go to them.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.280]   Elena has processed with her community.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.200]   She's prayed through it.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.440]   She just doesn't see the relationship going forward.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.240]   She thinks Jacob's a great guy,
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.560]   but in this scenario, she thinks,
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.600]   man, I don't think this is right.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.160]   So Elena, show us what this would look like.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.040]   Jacob, we're gonna need you over there.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:17.520]   - Jacob, I am thankful for the way
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.840]   that you have led me these past few months,
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.120]   but I've been praying and processing with community
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.440]   and I can't continue in this relationship.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.680]   Thank you for leading me in a godly way.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.680]   - Okay, that felt a little more chipper.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.280]   Maybe you wanna be in the breakup,
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.320]   but let's pretend that her heart was in that
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.800]   and she was kindly and gently trying to communicate this.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.720]   So Jacob, I apologize for all the heartbreak
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.560]   and you were a little too happy in that moment.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.640]   But you wanna communicate that you're honest.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.880]   You don't blame it on God.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.680]   You don't say, it's not you, it's me.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.320]   You don't just make something up.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.440]   You just tell the truth.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.760]   You express what's true.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.920]   Hey, I don't see this going forward at this time.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.280]   It doesn't mean the relationship is over forever
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.880]   and ever and ever, but you can just be honest
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.720]   and say, hey, I don't think it makes sense
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.640]   for us to continue dating and moving forward at this time.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.840]   You do it in person.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.120]   You're considerate of the other person involved.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.960]   You seek to leave them better than you found them
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.920]   throughout the entire thing.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.360]   Matthew 7, Jesus says the golden rule
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.800]   is that you treat other people
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.480]   as you wish they would treat you.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.400]   You treat other people as you wanna be treated.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.000]   And he says that the entire Bible
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.960]   is summed up in that verse.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.180]   And so even when we break up,
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.720]   we do so gently, caring about the other person
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.120]   or considerate with kindness as best we can,
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.080]   and we communicate the truth and speak in love.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.160]   But let's say they didn't break up.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.440]   So it just got really dark in here.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.960]   So the relationship continues going forward.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.120]   And it's early enough to where Jacob decides,
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.600]   man, I wanna honor her family.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.860]   I wanna honor her father.
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.080]   I wanna express to them, even him, if I get a chance,
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.060]   hey, here's my intentions for dating your daughter,
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.640]   and he's gonna have a chance to do that.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.720]   So Jacob has found himself at, he goes over,
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.160]   he initiates to set up a time
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.040]   to meet with Elena's father.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.040]   So Elena exits the scene, and here, Jacob,
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.420]   you're at the house, just go ahead and knock on that door
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.620]   or ring the doorbell, whichever one.
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:13.980]   (knocking)
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:14.800]   (doorbell rings)
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:17.700]   Hey, Jacob.
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.700]   (audience cheering)
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:29.900]   Good to meet you.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:30.720]   - Good to meet you, sir.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.920]   - I was just cleaning my gun.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.380]   - It's sometimes, her dad is Rambo,
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.220]   and in a white beater with a shotgun.
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.460]   - Excuse me while I put his shirt on.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.860]   - Is dad's mic on?
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.380]   All right, let's make sure that, all right.
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.420]   - So there they are.
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.020]   - 'Cause I'm saying some brilliant stuff.
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.180]   - I know you are, okay.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.020]   Hey, get that shirt, buddy.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:54.860]   - He's addressed, okay.
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:55.680]   - It's church behavior.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.520]   - Can you sit down?
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.360]   - Please, have a seat.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.180]   - Hey, you guys, sit down.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.380]   - Why aren't you sitting already?
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.380]   (audience laughing)
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.040]   What do you want?
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.180]   - So really, I just wanted to thank you
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.900]   for taking your time to meet with me,
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.780]   and I know you're a busy guy,
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.700]   and really just wanted to tell you that,
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.980]   you know, I just wanted to talk to you
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.320]   because I've really enjoyed dating your daughter, Elena.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.100]   - Good.
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:31.820]   - Yeah, and you know, the thing is, she's just really hot.
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.400]   - Come again.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.560]   - So this took a turn.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.260]   Mr. Anderson.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.420]   - Yeah, let's, why don't we try that again?
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.260]   - Okay.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.100]   - We should try that again.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:47.920]   - Action.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.820]   - Mr. Anderson, thank you so much for having me over,
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.620]   and really, I just came and wanted to thank you
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.600]   for raising such an amazing daughter,
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.340]   and I want you to know that I'm not wasting her time,
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.800]   and truly, my intentions are to date her with purity,
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.220]   and I wanted to give you my phone number
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.100]   in case you have any questions at all
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.140]   about our relationship.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.380]   - Yeah, man, well, I appreciate that.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.100]   - Absolutely, thank you.
[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.140]   (audience applauding)
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.060]   - Nicely done.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.980]   Okay, so hey, is there a verse that commands this?
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.780]   Yes, the Bible says that you and I
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.100]   are to honor our father and mother,
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.780]   and so out of that principle,
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:27.820]   what you're doing in this scenario
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.820]   is honoring her father and your mother.
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.860]   You may be going, wait a second,
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.380]   but the Bible doesn't say you have to go ask her father
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.560]   in order to date her.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.700]   In biblical times, you wouldn't need to command that
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.300]   because it was a law.
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.700]   You had to speak to the father
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.500]   in order to become the main male figure or guy in her life,
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.460]   and so all this is doing is you are establishing early on
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.900]   and modeling what it looks like to lead really well.
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.460]   What if her father's not a believer?
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.420]   Is it still relevant to do this?
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.860]   Yes.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.400]   It is showcasing how your faith informs
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.260]   the way that you date, live, everything.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.700]   So you're showing how Jesus impacts all of that,
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.840]   and you're being, honestly, a light to even that father.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.140]   So Jacob did a great job of this.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.780]   The relationship continues.
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.460]   They go through merge,
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.020]   watermarks premarital ministry.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.100]   Things continue to just develop.
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.980]   They are very much alike at this point.
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.540]   He decides, man, I wanna move towards marriage.
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.840]   My community is celebrating this relationship.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.580]   Other people in our life look at this thing,
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.380]   and they're like, man, that's a good thing,
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.700]   and so everywhere that I look,
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.020]   it seems like green light, green light,
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.660]   and I wanna move towards this woman
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.180]   being not just someone I'm dating,
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.720]   but someone I wanna spend the rest of my life with.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.980]   So he decides, I'm gonna ask for her hand in marriage.
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.140]   Fast forward six months, here we are.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.540]   They're at the golf range,
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:49.060]   playing golf with possible father-in-law.
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.100]   - So Jacob, how's the relationship going?
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.980]   - Well, Mr. Anderson, things are going well,
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.100]   and I've really enjoyed spending time with your daughter.
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:58.940]   - Good.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.460]   - And really, the reason I initiated golf with you today
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.220]   was I had a question for you.
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:11.600]   And so, Mr. Anderson, that question was,
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.540]   I'd like to ask your permission and blessing
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.860]   to ask Elena to become my wife.
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.700]   - That's interesting.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.900]   I need to switch clubs.
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.980]   I'm just kidding, buddy.
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.340]   Hey, welcome to the family.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:40.260]   Oh, man, what are they, father-in-law?
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.580]   All right, so they get engaged,
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.980]   or they're about to get engaged.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.380]   And he's decided, man, I'm gonna propose.
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.460]   So he buys a ring, plans it all out.
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.820]   He plans something that he believes
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.620]   that his girlfriend, hopefully fiancee, would like.
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.240]   That's just free, men.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.080]   You're gonna wanna make sure
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.580]   if she's not a jumbotron kind of girl,
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.820]   you don't do the jumbotron.
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.940]   And so he plans it all out, he thinks through it.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.460]   Probably he's gonna contact her friends and family,
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.980]   maybe to be a part of it.
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.860]   Head to some place that's sentimental to both of them.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.620]   And he's gonna ask her to be his wife.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.660]   So here we are, all alone on this page.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.580]   Anytime, guys.
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:19.940]   And apparently there's trouble in paradise
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.060]   that I didn't realize.
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.740]   And he's gonna ask her to be his wife.
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.580]   Jacob?
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:30.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.380]   Are you pacing?
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.620]   Elena?
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:40.220]   Okay, all right.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.060]   - This is weird.
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.060]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.900]   - Did you just spray on cologne back there?
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:47.860]   Just a little bit.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.700]   One spray, one spray.
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.540]   We'll run it back.
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.300]   (Elena laughing)
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:23:00.060]   Elena, but really, I just.
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.060]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.380]   Guys, we keep moving over here, we gotta come back.
[00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.380]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:20.100]   Elena, I just cannot imagine life without you.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.260]   And-- - Okay.
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.860]   - Have you seen any romantic movies?
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:23.860]   Get on a knee.
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.980]   Hashtag drop the knees.
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:34.220]   Elena, I just cannot imagine life without you.
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.900]   And I want to serve you for the rest of my life.
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:37.820]   Will you marry me?
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:41.260]   Wait, okay, now you're supposed to do the girl thing.
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.700]   You know, the (laughing)
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.900]   - Yes, I would love to marry you.
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.460]   - Okay, it's just a skit, okay.
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:03.100]   I apologize.
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:08.100]   They're married, they've been married for six months.
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.020]   It's legal to kiss on stage.
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.580]   Hey, give it up for our volunteers
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.620]   who took us from the ask out to the altar.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.420]   JP's gonna come back up, Father JP,
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.100]   and shut us down tonight.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.580]   Actually, he's cleaning the gun.
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.420]   Oh, there you are.
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.420]   (laughing)
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.660]   - How we doing, guys?
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:32.980]   Hey, is that fun or what?
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:33.820]   We learn anything?
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.860]   (audience cheering)
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.340]   Hey, here's the deal.
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:41.020]   The reason we do that is as JP, as David,
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.660]   David is his name, as David said up front,
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.660]   you know, the number one thing that we get asked is,
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.580]   "Hey, can you make it practical?"
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.540]   Like, show us what it looks like.
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.460]   And can you explain it to us in images?
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.860]   And I love that because that's what Jesus would do.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.620]   You think about the Sermon on the Mount, right?
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.700]   He would say, "Look at the birds.
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.380]   "The birds are flying by."
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:03.860]   And he would teach through imagery so much so,
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.140]   I think more than you would ever imagine,
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.980]   this idea of marriage and relationships,
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.820]   it's all about him.
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.820]   And I want you to hang in there with me for a moment, okay?
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.300]   I want you to think about this.
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:22.300]   I want you to travel back with me to about 300 BC.
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.820]   So about 300 years before Christ.
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:28.340]   Let me kind of explain some traditions to you.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.700]   There'd be a young Jewish boy, a Hebrew child.
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.260]   He would grow up in his father's home
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.180]   until he hit the adult age
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.060]   and it was time to go look for a wife.
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:42.100]   What he would do is he would leave his father's house
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:46.140]   and he would go to a foreign land looking for a partner
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.620]   to spend the rest of his life with.
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.900]   And he would begin to ask people
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.060]   to find out who had a reputable reputation,
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:59.060]   who was someone that would make an incredible helper to him.
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.860]   And when he would find her,
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:06.860]   then his father would come and pay what was called a dowry.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.580]   It literally was like a down payment, if you will.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:15.580]   It was a ton of money to step into a legal agreement,
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.620]   not illegal, but a legal agreement.
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.100]   So not just an engagement,
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.940]   but a legal binding agreement with her.
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.940]   And then what would happen is the two would make a toast.
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.180]   And the reason I tell you this
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.620]   is because this is where our traditions come from today.
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.860]   The reason you do a wedding toast
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:36.380]   dates back to biblical ideas and Jewish traditions.
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.660]   And so they would drink from the same cup.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.580]   And at that time, those two were bound together,
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.300]   but they were not married.
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.760]   And so what he would do then
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.940]   is he would go back to his land.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.940]   He would go back to his father's home.
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.740]   And because that was his home
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.820]   and inheritance was everything at that time,
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.980]   he would begin to build a room for them
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.980]   on his father's house.
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.420]   And so he would spend the next year or so
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.520]   building a room for them.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.360]   Where was she?
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:10.260]   She was back in her land making preparations.
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.460]   She was gathering a group of women.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:16.520]   Listen, you know where we get the tradition bridesmaids?
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.240]   It comes from this.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.920]   She would gather a group of women.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.080]   And at that time, it wasn't just to like,
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.800]   you know, stand up there with you.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.960]   You would actually do something.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.440]   You would begin to make her dress.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.040]   You would begin to help her prepare
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.000]   for a lifetime of marriage.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.120]   And then when that Hebrew child was done making that room,
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.700]   that girl would have no idea the time or the hour.
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.500]   All right?
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.520]   And he would leave his father's house now
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.160]   with the room prepared for them.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.280]   And he would go back
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.980]   and he would send some men ahead of them.
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.960]   You want to know where we get the tradition groomsmen?
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.420]   These guys would travel ahead of him
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.380]   as he goes back for his bride to take her home,
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.820]   to be his wife.
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.360]   And they would say, "He's coming.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.440]   "Your groom is coming for you."
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.400]   And sometimes they would blast trumpets
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.440]   and the sound would travel ahead of them from town to town.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.760]   It would move ahead of them.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.800]   "Oh, a groom is coming.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.480]   "Hey, pass it on to the next town.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.020]   "A groom is coming for his wife.
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:15.980]   "This is her name.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.220]   "Go and tell her."
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.420]   And then when her bridesmaids would catch word,
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.480]   there was, "He's coming.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.440]   "He's coming for you."
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.320]   And they would get all excited and do that thing,
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.240]   you know, they do.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.800]   And then she would get ready.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.080]   She would put on that dress
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.600]   and she would prepare herself for her groom-to-be
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.920]   to come and take her.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.960]   And he would.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.400]   And he'd take her home.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.040]   But what was waiting for them there was a party,
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.360]   a celebration.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.840]   And they would go, and this is where it gets PG-13.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.080]   They would go into the bridal chamber
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.480]   or that room that he prepared,
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.180]   and they would be in there for seven days.
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:57.480]   Seven days, sealing the marriage.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.760]   And she was veiled.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.000]   No one had seen her yet.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.520]   And there's a party outside.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.360]   Now, consider how awkward that is.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.920]   Everybody's just partying outside for seven days.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.880]   Guys, this is where we get a seven-day honeymoon.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.200]   These traditions are entrenched.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.600]   Deep, deep, deep traditions.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.520]   Where do you think they come from?
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.520]   And then she would come out
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.200]   and he would present her to his family
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.160]   for the very first time.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.960]   "This is my bride."
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.620]   Now, consider what Jesus says.
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:37.000]   He's talking to Thomas.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.800]   Even before that, consider what it says
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.560]   in the scriptures, that he's gonna come,
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:46.000]   the hour, the date, the time, that is not aware.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.600]   We're not, we don't know.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.040]   With a trumpet blast, he's gonna show up.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.040]   But if you consider what he says to Thomas,
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.680]   he says, "Hey, we don't know the way."
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.360]   Thomas says, "Jesus, we don't know the way."
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.320]   He says, "You do know the way."
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.480]   It's John 14.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.760]   He says, "You do know the way.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.640]   "I've told you, if it were not so.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.760]   "See, my Father's house has many rooms.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.600]   "I go to prepare a place for you.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.280]   "I go there to prepare a place for you."
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.640]   And then we see the time and the hour
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:18.000]   is not known to us, that he's going to come back for us.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.080]   Don't you see this life and this world
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.080]   and your existence and the fact that your heart beats
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.960]   in your chest and you have breath in your lungs
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:31.080]   is about so much more than an earthly relationship.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.360]   I did a wedding two weeks ago
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.480]   and that groom was up there.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:44.280]   And I watch him, right, before those doors open in the back.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.480]   The groomsmen have come down and he's there
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.960]   and I'm standing there and the whole place
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.120]   is filled with hope.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.800]   You know, the mother is about to stand to her feet
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.720]   and the whole place is filled with hope.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.840]   And I'm watching him because his eyes
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.160]   are glued on that back door and it's about to swing open
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.500]   and he doesn't know when.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.040]   And he's about to see his bride for the first time
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:13.160]   on that day and she's been preparing herself.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:17.640]   And it always, when the doors swing open, man,
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.420]   I watch them, they can't hold it together
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:22.360]   no matter how big and how strong and, you know,
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.440]   how macho and even if they hadn't cried in 10 years.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.800]   And she's like, that lip starts to quiver,
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.880]   starts to do that thing.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.880]   I watch him and she walks down the aisle
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.480]   and she just, ear to ear.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:40.120]   And that's our job.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:44.040]   That's what you're doing right now.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.920]   You didn't even know it.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.760]   Right now, you're waiting for the sky to crack open
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.140]   and roll back like a scroll.
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.960]   And your bridegroom, he's coming on a white horse
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.140]   and he's returning for you.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.640]   And he's gonna take you home to his father's house.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.920]   He's gonna take you home to his father's house.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.440]   And not just that, but he's gonna present you pure and holy
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:11.000]   like a spotless virgin, clean.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.200]   And you think, but I'm not clean.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.160]   That's what he does.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.680]   That's his job description.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.080]   He makes you clean.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.160]   He takes all the stuff you've been involved in,
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.840]   all the thoughts you've had and the things
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.480]   that have happened to you and the things
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.680]   you've been a part of and he cleans you up
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:34.080]   and he presents you in his father's court, pure and holy.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.880]   What a humbling thing.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:40.700]   Pure and holy, spotless, his bride.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.380]   And so all the pleasure that you think of
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:45.840]   that you've been waiting for,
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.400]   or maybe you've experienced in a really cheap form,
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:53.360]   through intimacy, that's a metaphor.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.000]   Like God made us.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.080]   That's like heaven all the time, expounded upon.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.620]   It's us in the bridegroom, Jesus.
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.560]   And so you don't need to get married
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.080]   to learn more about God, but you can understand
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.900]   that he's given us relationships
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.080]   to teach us something about him.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.520]   And that's why we've been talking about,
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:19.400]   when we say first comes love, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.760]   He loved you first.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.240]   First comes love indeed.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.160]   So what is our right response, yours and mine?
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.000]   It's to worship.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.760]   So that's what we're gonna do now.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.120]   We're gonna worship.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.320]   So Father, we love you and we thank you
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.560]   for the gift of relationships.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:44.400]   We thank you that while we were yet sinners,
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.280]   you sent your son here.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.000]   And we thank you that he didn't just stay here,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.640]   but he went home to prepare a place for us
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.040]   in your house.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:59.340]   In your courts, we will live forever.
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:06.360]   We will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.520]   Forever and ever and ever.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.000]   Father, now as we sing to you,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.940]   would you renew our hearts and minds around that reality?
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:17.600]   That we get to be with you forever.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.600]   God, thank you for laughter.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.840]   And thank you for simple truths.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.360]   And thank you for biblical ideas
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.760]   that you didn't leave us here just to flounder.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.280]   And God, for those of us that we hear all of that
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.640]   and we just feel like, man, we have no one to apply it with.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.860]   God, would you fill our hearts with hope, with Jesus,
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:39.560]   that we're gonna be with you forever and ever and ever
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.400]   and ever.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.680]   Would you make that enough for us today?
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.640]   Please, God.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:50.160]   In the name of Christ, your son, amen.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:53.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
