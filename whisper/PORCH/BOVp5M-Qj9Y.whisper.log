[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.240]   All right, Porch, how are we doing tonight?
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.240]   You doing OK?
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.040]   It's great to see you.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.760]   Thanks for making the time to join us.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.120]   I never take it for granted that you would step away
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.640]   from whatever else you could be doing
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.480]   and you would be in the room with us.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.080]   I think God has something special in store for tonight,
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.720]   not just for the people in Dallas, Texas,
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.880]   though I think that's true.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.920]   Also for all of you that are tuning in online
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.360]   all over the place, thanks so much
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.160]   for being a part of the Porch.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.760]   Special shout out to Porch Live Midland and Springfield
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.040]   and Greater Lafayette.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.120]   We love you guys.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.520]   We think that God genuinely can meet with anybody
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.200]   at any time and in any place, and that includes you.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.960]   So we're really grateful that you're here with us tonight.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.920]   Well, a couple of years ago, Brooke and I
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.360]   took a cruise where one of the stops along the way
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.400]   was to the island of Belize.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.560]   Anybody been to Belize before?
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.880]   OK, yeah.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.760]   If you haven't been, which we had not,
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.920]   what you need to know is that in order to get to the island,
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.640]   you actually have to take a ferry from the ship
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.840]   to arrive at the port.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.480]   You can't just dock the ship right against the shoreline.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.560]   You have to catch a ferry.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.240]   And so knowing that we were going
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.880]   to have to catch a ferry to get there,
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.960]   the recommended pathway is to know
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.360]   what you're going to do should you go to the island.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.680]   And we didn't have any plans.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.120]   And so we thought, OK, we need to figure it out.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.440]   We don't want to necessarily miss out on an opportunity
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.680]   to experience a new country.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.200]   And so let's go visit with the excursion guide.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.760]   Let's figure out what they would recommend we can do
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.520]   and assess our options and pick something
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.560]   that could be really fun.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.520]   So we go and we visit with the tour guide.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.400]   And they tell us all the different things,
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.200]   the smattering of opportunity that
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.600]   exists within the cruise that you
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.720]   can participate on the shore.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.720]   And yet, as we finish our conversation with them,
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.280]   they share with us one very critical rule
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.040]   to live by, which was do not go to shore unless you
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.680]   book an excursion through us.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.280]   Don't go to shore unless you book an excursion through us.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.920]   And so naturally, we chose to book an excursion
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.240]   through someone else entirely.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.880]   No offense to the cruise line.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.360]   It's just way cheaper to book through something like Expedia.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.920]   And so we were excited.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.720]   The day arrived.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.800]   We had made this incredible plan of what we would
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.160]   do when we got to the shore.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.120]   And so we get up, and the sun's shining,
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.320]   and the birds are singing, and the weather's perfect.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.720]   And we go down, and we get on the ferry.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.200]   We make our way to shore.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.400]   And as we take a look around the town square of Belize
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.960]   for our reputable tour agency, they
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.080]   were nowhere to be found.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.440]   Instead of a tour agency, there was one Captain Tom
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.960]   waiting for us with his quote, unquote,
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.040]   "company van," which was suspect, to say the least.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.360]   You see, we had been duped.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.920]   We had shown up expecting one thing, promised
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.120]   the experience of a lifetime.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.400]   And yet, here we were in the middle of a foreign country
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.800]   about to journey into a random jungle with a total stranger
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.120]   that we knew nothing about.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.400]   How do you think we felt in that moment?
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.120]   Betrayed would be a really good assessment of the situation,
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.320]   because that's what we felt.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.120]   We were expecting one thing, but we'd
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.200]   received something else instead.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.280]   And I'm not judging Tom.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.160]   I don't know the guy.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.660]   I want to believe the best about him.
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.680]   And yet, what I know is this is the stuff of 60 Minutes.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.760]   You know, it's a young married man
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.520]   with his newly betrothed wife in the middle of a foreign country
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.400]   journeying into a jungle of unknown proportion
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.380]   in the back of a serial killer van with a stranger
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.960]   that we know nothing about.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.400]   This is the kind of stuff that makes the headlines back home.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.780]   So I was having no part of it.
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.640]   We were not going to take this trip.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.800]   You ever been in a spot like that, where you thought
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.720]   you were going to get one thing, but you ended up
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.680]   getting something else?
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.800]   You were promised something, but you received something else
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.300]   instead?
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.440]   Maybe it was that product you ordered off of Timu.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.080]   It showed up.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.040]   And it was just a couple sizes too small
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.200]   whenever it finally arrived.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.160]   Looked promising, but it just didn't deliver.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.660]   Maybe it was the perfect car at the perfect price.
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.440]   And you've been searching for a long time,
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.360]   and you finally make your way, and you see it.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.880]   And you start to look it over.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.880]   They hand you the car fax, and you realize it's a lemon.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.560]   It won't even crank up.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.080]   Maybe it's not a product you bought.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.880]   Maybe it's someone you matched with online,
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.240]   because that never happens.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.420]   You show up expecting them to be one person,
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.800]   and yet they're a completely different person in real life.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.640]   Maybe it's not that.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.440]   Maybe it's a three-carat diamond ring
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.440]   that in your responsible adulting,
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.200]   you decided to go and get appraised only
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.360]   to learn that it's the highest quality CZ on the market.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.320]   You see, we've all been there.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.560]   And while the cost varies depending on the situation,
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.120]   the reality is it's costly nonetheless.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.040]   But what if it isn't just something physical?
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.000]   What if it's something spiritual?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.960]   What if it's something that you didn't just lose money on
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.800]   that you bought?
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.840]   What if it's some part of yourself you lost
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.820]   because of someone you believed in?
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.580]   What if you placed your trust in that pastor,
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.920]   or that religious leader, or that parent,
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.880]   or that student leader from your childhood,
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.500]   or some spiritual seeker that was giving you guidance,
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.900]   and what you realized is though you had placed your trust
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.040]   in them, they did not deliver what you expected.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.380]   They betrayed that trust.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.700]   If that's you, then this night's for you.
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.300]   See, last week we shared that we're in the middle
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.220]   of a new series called Deconstructed,
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.600]   where we're trying to rebuild your reality,
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.700]   because the truth of the matter is,
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.420]   many of us have had our reality totally wrecked
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.100]   by somebody at some place at some point in the past.
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.580]   And often it's most tragically done
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.180]   by those that should have been building our reality,
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.180]   boosting our belief, constructing our faith, Christians.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.100]   And what do we do when we find ourselves
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.940]   in the midst of something like that?
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.940]   Well, according to Pew Research, just last year,
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.500]   they found that many people choose to
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.300]   unaffiliate with religiosity entirely.
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.980]   In their study, they found that 28%,
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.300]   meaning over a quarter of Americans
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.780]   religiously identified as nones,
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.100]   not N-U-N-S, but N-O-N-E-S.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.900]   They were religiously unaffiliated.
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.740]   And what's surprising, it actually made them
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.460]   the largest religious group in America today.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.020]   Bigger even than Protestants or Catholics.
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.980]   When asked why people had become irreligious,
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.020]   their responses ranged between one of two things.
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.620]   Either they didn't like the religious organization,
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.580]   or they had a bad experience with that religious group
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.300]   at some point in the past,
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.100]   meaning that we no longer live in a post-Christian age.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.860]   We actually live in an anti-Christian age,
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.220]   where people are no longer just indifferent to Christians.
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.540]   They're actually antagonistic towards Christians.
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.940]   They've had some experience with us at some point
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:24.780]   where they look and say,
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.220]   "Man, I just don't know that this is worth it."
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.500]   And oftentimes, they have good reason.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.740]   Many people have tried Christianity,
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.740]   and they've found antiquated answers for modern problems,
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.580]   and yet whenever they pushed it up against the real world,
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.860]   they found those answers were lacking.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.820]   Others found that the religion they were ascribing to,
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.140]   it demanded their obedience,
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.100]   and in the process, it distorted their personality,
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.940]   and it damaged their mental health forever,
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.660]   and they're still working to this day
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.380]   to pick up the pieces.
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.660]   Others, they know that,
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.380]   man, someone that they trusted,
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.580]   they ended up getting betrayed by
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.420]   because they played the part of the hypocrite.
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.660]   They hid something in secret.
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.980]   They did something egregious.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.580]   They abused someone innocent,
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.820]   and at the sight of all of that, once exposed,
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:04.940]   they said, "I have to get out of this
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.260]   "because this does not seem like something
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.980]   "I want to be a part of."
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.780]   Others, they just look at Christianity,
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.840]   and they think it is synonymous with political idolatry.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.840]   They think that it's the stuff
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.040]   of hysterical conspiracy theory.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.420]   In 2021, there was a survey conducted
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.900]   that found one in four Christians
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.540]   agreed with this statement.
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.580]   "The government, media, and financial worlds in the US
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.180]   "are controlled by a group of Satan-worshiping pedophiles
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.220]   "who run a global child sex trafficking operation."
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.420]   One in four Christians agreed with that statement.
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.400]   We hear stuff like that,
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.340]   and we don't know how to feel about it.
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.180]   Like, if that's what these people think,
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.140]   I don't know that I want to be a part of these people
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.080]   because it sounds like their way of thinking is too narrow.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.020]   It's too violent.
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.180]   It's too imperialistic.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.380]   It seems pretty toxic.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.980]   It's probably homophobic.
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.260]   It's likely patriarchal in some sense,
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.860]   and I don't know that I actually find it believable.
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.540]   If that's you, and you're here tonight,
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.780]   and you've thought one of those things
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.220]   at some point in the past,
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.700]   and you would honestly identify
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.060]   that you're on the road to deconstruction
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.860]   at some level, maybe you're at the beginning,
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:12.900]   maybe you're in the middle,
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.780]   maybe you're at the final stop,
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.780]   what you need to know is you're in good company
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.140]   because nobody defended the religiously ridiculed
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.300]   and the spiritually traumatized like Jesus.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.880]   You see, when you read the Gospels,
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.440]   what you find is Jesus, he stands up for those
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.260]   that the religious would beat down or push aside.
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.780]   He defends the woman caught in adultery
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.460]   as she's thrown at his feet.
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.140]   He kneels down beside her,
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.540]   and he tells the people to cast stones,
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.600]   yet none of them can because none of them are without sin.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.420]   He defends her.
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.300]   We find that he protects the woman of the city
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.260]   as he's sitting at Simon the Pharisee's house.
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.100]   We know that the woman at the well,
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.820]   he takes time to actually listen to her story,
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.540]   which catches her so off guard
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.700]   because he's a religious leader,
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.620]   and typically her experience has proved
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.560]   that those people are harsh.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.740]   Instead, we know that there was a series where,
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.980]   there was a scene where a man was brought to him
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.300]   and Jesus decided to heal him on the Sabbath,
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.780]   which violated one of the Old Testament observances,
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.780]   and yet Jesus raises the bar and actually identifies
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.900]   what that rule was always intended for.
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.540]   We see that he sits with sinners and tax collectors
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.260]   over dinner despite the fact
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.680]   that the religious ridiculed them,
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.100]   and what we know is Jesus himself
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.540]   was even religiously wounded by those
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.940]   that claimed to love the same God.
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.720]   He came to promote himself.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.340]   Jesus knows a thing or two about church hurt,
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.740]   and so if you're here and that's your story,
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.140]   then you're in good company.
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.980]   I think he wants to meet you in yours.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.420]   Like this is not a message of hype.
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.960]   This is not a series of hype.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.180]   These are evenings of help.
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.700]   We just wanna read the scripture
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.140]   and we wanna see the heart of God
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.420]   and we wanna have him meet us in whatever it is
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.980]   we find ourselves in because many of us tonight,
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.660]   we are in the middle of church hurt,
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.420]   and my belief is that he wants to restore
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.620]   your relationship to the church.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.400]   Like just because you've had bad doctors
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.260]   doesn't mean you give up
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.500]   on the idea of hospitals altogether,
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.580]   and yet before Jesus restores your relationship to the church
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.900]   he wants to restore your relationship to himself
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.260]   because he is the one that leads the church.
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.980]   He wants you to have a right relationship with the bride,
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.500]   but he wants to get a right relationship
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.760]   with the groom first and foremost,
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.620]   and to do it he's gonna talk to us
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.820]   through Matthew chapter 23.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.340]   So if you have a Bible, turn with me to Matthew chapter 23.
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.040]   While you're turning there, we are catching up with Jesus
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.020]   on what's traditionally understood to be a Tuesday
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.460]   in the midst of the Holy Week.
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.220]   The Holy Week would have been the last week of his life,
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.120]   meaning that he's in the final two minute drill
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.180]   of his existence.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.860]   Every play he makes, every conversation he has,
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.940]   everything he does, it matters a lot
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.060]   because there's still some work that needs to be done
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.900]   at this point in his life
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.420]   before he decides to die, rise,
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.260]   and ascend to the Father in heaven.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.500]   And so we find him in the middle of a conversation
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.540]   with the religious leaders of his day.
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.260]   You've got issues with religious leaders in your day?
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.980]   Just wait till we read what we're gonna read tonight.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.740]   Jesus takes a massive issue
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.460]   with the religious leaders of his day
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.060]   because in the conversation we find him,
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.820]   and he is going to confront all of them
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.640]   in the areas that they have failed miserably.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.700]   And as we do, we're gonna see that he pronounces seven woes
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.200]   or seven judgments against them
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.280]   for the ways that they have misled the people,
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.980]   that they have taken the people farther
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.860]   from the heart of God
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.220]   and led them further into religiosity, empty religiosity.
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.740]   And as we do it, as we read these seven woes,
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.180]   here's what I think we're gonna try and pick up.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.180]   I think we're going to find a series of warnings
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.780]   that we should pay attention to
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.780]   that will tell us what we should be on the lookout for,
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.140]   but not just warnings as well as ways
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:01.300]   that we should be looking for in ourself.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.180]   So here's what it says, Matthew chapter 23,
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.220]   we're gonna take it verse by verse, starting in verse 13.
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:10.620]   It says, "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.620]   "hypocrites, for you shut the kingdom of heaven
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.580]   "in people's faces, for you neither enter yourselves
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.560]   "nor allow those who would enter to go in."
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.540]   You see, the first thing that Jesus wants us to know
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.900]   is that we should beware of those
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.320]   who stress aptitude over attitude.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.660]   We should beware of those
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.820]   who stress aptitude over attitude,
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.740]   which doesn't exactly raise any eyebrows
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.000]   until you realize who Jesus is speaking to in this moment.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.740]   He is talking to the Pharisees and scribes.
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.580]   You see, what you need to know about the Pharisees
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.940]   and scribes is they are one of four religious sects
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.340]   in ancient Judaism that actually would have
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.780]   theologically aligned closest with Jesus,
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.760]   and most likely closest to all of us.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.340]   They believe in things that we believe in,
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.700]   things that Jesus believes in.
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.500]   They believe in the resurrection from the dead,
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.260]   and they study the Old Testament scriptures,
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.360]   and they agree with the reality of a spiritual realm.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.860]   They believe that God's gonna send a Messiah
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.340]   that's going to deliver the people of God,
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.660]   the nation of Israel, from their oppressors.
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.460]   They believe the same things we believe.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.340]   They are theologically precise,
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.620]   so much so that they're the kind of friends
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.100]   you'd cheat off of in high school just to get a good grade.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.220]   They knew better than you.
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.820]   They know better than all of us
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.660]   with respect to their religion,
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.420]   and yet what we know is that Jesus is judging them
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.780]   because they're shutting the door
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.740]   on the kingdom of heaven in people's faces.
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.820]   Why is he judging them?
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.160]   Because of that.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.900]   Because while they know much about the study of God,
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.400]   they do not know much about the God of their study.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.320]   While they know much about the doctrine of God,
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.820]   they don't know much about the God of their doctrine.
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.700]   Again, these are the spiritual leaders of the day.
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.020]   Like, these are the kind of people
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.620]   that you would've followed on social media.
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.960]   You would've gone to conferences to hear speak,
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.900]   reading their books at night.
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.740]   You would've tuned in to see
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.660]   what new insight they had to offer.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.260]   You would've made sure to follow them on social media.
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.860]   Like, they had great things to say about who God is.
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.300]   They had great things to say about the word of God,
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.340]   and they had great things to say about the kingdom of God,
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.980]   and yet here's the thing we learn
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.500]   is though they knew who God was,
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.820]   they didn't recognize him when he stood face-to-face
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.520]   with them in the person of Christ.
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.440]   Though they studied the word carefully,
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.440]   they did not recognize the voice of God
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.160]   when he spoke to them from Jesus's own mouth.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.800]   And though they anticipated the coming kingdom,
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.720]   they didn't receive it
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.340]   when Jesus actually came to bring it to them.
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.380]   They thought they knew so well,
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.340]   but what we realize is they didn't know anything at all.
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.180]   They had more of a relationship to religion
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.760]   than a relationship with God.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.500]   And the consequence is they not only failed
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.820]   to enter the kingdom,
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.780]   but they kept others from entering the kingdom themselves.
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:48.220]   It's kind of like movie critics and famous films.
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.980]   You see, there are experts in the field of cinema
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.520]   that make great judgments on a variety of different options,
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.860]   and yet what you find is smattered
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.580]   throughout the history books are a variety of criticisms
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.720]   that are really pretty unjustified.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.900]   You see, some famous critics,
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.100]   the experts in their industry,
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.820]   have looked at some of the most famous movies of all time,
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.740]   and they've given mixed reviews, if not scathing reviews.
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.740]   Movies like "Forrest Gump," "Star Wars, A New Hope,"
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.740]   "Casablanca," "The Wizard of Oz," and "The Sandlot."
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.860]   They look at these films
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.860]   and initially give really poor reviews upon their debut,
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.100]   and yet what we realize is the people
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.260]   that know everything about movies
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.280]   actually don't know anything
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.700]   about the most famous movies of all time.
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.900]   That's who the Pharisees are in this moment.
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.860]   You see, they misjudge Jesus completely.
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.980]   They write a scathing review.
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.560]   And sadly, because others listen to them,
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.260]   they cause them to miss out on the kingdom as well.
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:52.820]   Porch, it's not enough that church leaders,
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.040]   Christians in general, have theological proficiency.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.180]   We want that, to be clear.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.460]   We wanna be theologically precise.
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.340]   We wanna be accurate.
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.220]   We don't wanna have cheap grace in our services.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.400]   We want to be theologically proficient,
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.940]   but that's just not enough.
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.580]   Theological proficiency is insufficient
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:10.240]   without relational proximity to God.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.820]   It's one thing to love the teachings of God
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.380]   and the doctrine of God and the history of God
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.940]   and the study of God and the word of God,
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:22.160]   but not love the person of God himself in Jesus Christ.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.100]   That makes no sense.
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:28.200]   But as Christians, we're called to look at the world
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.460]   and say, "Hey, I don't just have the appearance of religion.
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:35.800]   I actually demonstrate the reality of a relationship to God.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.940]   You can look at me and you can see I've been marked.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:38.780]   I've been changed.
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.420]   I've been transformed, not just informed,
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.800]   but transformed in my life."
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.740]   This is who Jesus is calling us to be.
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.840]   And yet so often Christians miss out on it.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.300]   Dallas Willard said it like this
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.100]   in "Spirit of the Disciplines."
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.860]   He said, "How many people are radically and permanently
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.980]   repelled from the way by Christians
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.100]   who are unfeeling, stiff, unapproachable,
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.740]   boringly lifeless, obsessive, and dissatisfied?
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.340]   Yet such Christians are everywhere.
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:10.420]   And what they're missing is the wholesome liveliness
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.900]   that springs forth from a balanced vitality
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.600]   within the freedom of God's loving rule.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.900]   Spirituality wrongly understood or pursued
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.220]   is a major source of human misery and rebellion against God.
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.060]   Some of you are miserable at the thought of God
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.300]   and rebelling against all his ways
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.340]   because you have been given a spirituality
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.460]   that is wrongly understood.
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.620]   So what does a spirituality
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.700]   that is rightly understood look like?"
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.500]   Well, Zachariah tells us.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.340]   He says this.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.100]   He says, "This is what the Lord of heaven's armies says.
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.340]   In those days, 10 men from different nations,"
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.880]   meaning people that do not know God,
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.060]   "they will clutch the sleeve of one Jew.
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.440]   And they will say, 'Please let us walk with you
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.380]   for we've heard that God is with you.'"
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.940]   Porch, let me ask you.
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.560]   Have people heard that God's with you?
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.100]   Or have they just heard about God from you?
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:10.020]   There's a massive difference in those two things.
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.340]   One is intellectually acquainted.
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.700]   One is intimately acquainted with Jesus.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.020]   The world is wondering
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:21.420]   what is true of the Christian faith?
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.060]   What's characteristic of the church?
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.280]   And what they should see is not just knowledge,
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.300]   but genuine belief,
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:32.020]   not just learning, but life's meant to be lived.
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:35.180]   And thus give convincing.
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.060]   That's what they should see.
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.900]   Jesus tells us what to look out for.
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.480]   And then here in this moment, he's saying,
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.860]   "Hey, look, there's something you should look like.
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.380]   You should not merely look intellectually informed,
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.260]   but you should look intimately transformed."
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.900]   That's what should be true of my people.
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.900]   That's the first way that he intends us to look.
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.300]   The second is in verse 15.
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.500]   It says this, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.980]   hypocrites, for you travel across sea and land
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.380]   to make a single proselyte.
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.540]   And when he becomes a proselyte,
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.940]   you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves."
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.980]   The second thing that Jesus warns us
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.380]   is that we should beware of those
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.740]   who convert to their cause before the kingdom.
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:21.220]   We should beware of those who convert to their cause
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.100]   before the kingdom, because according to Jesus,
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.680]   leaders can not only dissuade you
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.700]   from believing the right things,
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.620]   they can persuade you to believe the wrong things.
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.900]   That's what the Pharisees and scribes
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.100]   are doing in this moment.
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.340]   Like when Jesus says, when he uses the word proselyte,
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.140]   that's just another word for convert.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.380]   It's to take somebody that believes one thing
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.640]   and lead them to believe something different.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.060]   Instead, and this was actually a really important thing
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.780]   to the nation of Israel, because God had called them
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.580]   in the Old Testament to be a light to the nations.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.060]   Like they were meant to present a convincing case
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.480]   to the watching world that God is true
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.480]   and he is worthy of walking with.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.140]   And so the Pharisees and scribes,
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.700]   they're living into this command.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.380]   They know this is what's meant to be true of us.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.980]   And yet they give a different kind of light
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.820]   than the light that God intends us to give.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.340]   You see, the kind of light we should give to the world
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.280]   is sort of like a space heater.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.360]   What's a space heater do?
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.500]   When you see it, you move out from the cold
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.980]   and into the warmth.
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.660]   And as you spend time in the presence of that space heater,
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.380]   near that light, you feel good.
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.980]   It takes away the chill.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:38.980]   It dusts off the cold and it comforts you in its company.
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.740]   That's what the people of God are meant to be like.
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:43.820]   And yet the Pharisees and scribes,
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.540]   they're not really a space heater.
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.740]   They're more of a bug zapper.
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.180]   They have a magnetizing effect.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.060]   They're drawing people in.
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.460]   And yet the closer you get,
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:59.300]   like you get, you get not life, you get death.
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.120]   Like you get electrocuted.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.700]   Like you find out this is not actually going to lead
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.540]   to my flourishing.
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.260]   This is going to lead to my perishing.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.540]   That's what we find with these Pharisees.
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.600]   They have a similar magnetizing effect.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.100]   And yet their light leads to death,
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.740]   not life like God intended.
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.360]   That's what Jesus is getting at in this verse.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.540]   He's telling the Pharisees that rather than convert people
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.260]   to the kingdom, what they have chosen to do
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.780]   is they have chosen to convert them to their cause.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.180]   So what's the cause that he's converting them to?
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.380]   The cause of the Pharisees and scribes
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.500]   are trying to convert people to
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.660]   was a set of oral tradition.
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.580]   They had developed over 1500 commands
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:38.380]   known as fence laws that surrounded God's own mosaic law
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.880]   to protect people from actually doing
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.800]   what they shouldn't do.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.360]   It was a preventative measure.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.600]   And yet it was so cumbersome.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.560]   Like while the idea seemed to make a lot of sense,
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.960]   what we realize is it actually perpetuated
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.320]   something really damaging.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.260]   It led people to think that they could actually
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:58.720]   make themselves righteous through manmade legalism.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.160]   And if not that, it would dissuade people
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.960]   from going all in with Jesus and following after God
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.200]   and instead indulging whatever it is they wanted
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.260]   in their selfishness.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.940]   It had a repulsive effect.
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:15.620]   And it damaged people in ways it never meant to happen.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:20.140]   You see, we may not adhere to the oral traditions
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.900]   of the Pharisees, but many Christians nonetheless
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.320]   advocate personal projects or social causes
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.580]   that are similarly damaging.
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.940]   And some of you have lived through that.
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.660]   Like whether it's seeing your church compel people
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.180]   to vote a certain way or watching a religious system
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.180]   perpetuate poverty and racism or sexual abuse
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.540]   or seeing Christians tolerate brokenness and sin
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.980]   out of a desire to love other people
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.180]   or advocating social reform at the expense
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.580]   of biblical truth, religious people and leaders
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.540]   most of all frequently convert people to their cause
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.300]   and not to Christ's kingdom.
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:24:00.140]   We're not called to convince people
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.460]   of the merits of our passion points.
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.140]   We're meant to convince people
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.500]   of the passionate pursuit of Christ for them.
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.260]   That's what we're called to do.
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:13.660]   So many people are disillusioned with what we believe
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.340]   as the people of God because we have given them
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:20.300]   poor reason to follow him and a reason that God
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.600]   never intended to be offered in the first place.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.980]   No, everything the world is looking for,
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.060]   everything many of you are looking for,
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.260]   freedom and fullness and purpose and love
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:35.260]   and acceptance and community and a deep sense
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:40.260]   of abiding joy, all of that is actually found in God.
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.820]   It's not found anywhere else.
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.100]   It's not going to be achieved through some other cause.
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.300]   It's going to be found in Christ.
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.460]   And the amazing thing is while none of us
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.700]   could actually receive that on our own,
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.200]   he came to bring that and give it to you as a gift.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.300]   If you'd step into relationship with him
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:00.820]   and walk with him today, tomorrow and the rest of your life,
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.920]   this is what's available.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.460]   There's a beauty to the character of God
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.740]   that affords for us all the luxury we want in life.
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.820]   Not material luxury, but intrinsic luxury,
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.500]   a luxury that's characteristic of heaven and not earth.
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.140]   That's what he comes to give.
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:25.180]   And yet many of us, we look to some sort of earthly
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.900]   social cause to achieve that end instead.
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.640]   Jesus comes to rescue us from that.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.540]   You see, the second way he intends his people to look
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:37.340]   is he intends for us to look as a people
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.220]   passionate for the kingdom
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.700]   and not just passionate for our causes.
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.540]   But he doesn't stop there.
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.360]   He keeps going.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.980]   He says this in verse 16, he says,
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.720]   "Woe to you, blind guides who say
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.040]   "if anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.820]   "But if anyone swears by the gold of the temple,
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.740]   "he's bound by his oath.
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:02.860]   "You blind fools, like for which is greater,
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.200]   "the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred?
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.740]   "And you say, if anyone swears by the altar, it's nothing.
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.580]   "But if anyone swears by the gift that's on the altar,
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.900]   "he's bound by his oath.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.560]   "You blind men, for which is greater,
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.460]   "the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.240]   "So whoever swears by the altar,
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.180]   "swears by it and by everything on it.
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.180]   "And whoever swears by the temple,
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.020]   "swears by it and by him who dwells in it.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.220]   "And whoever swears by heaven,
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.500]   "swears by the throne of God
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.700]   "and by him who sits upon it."
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.660]   The third thing that Jesus is warning us tonight
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.180]   is that we should beware of those
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.580]   who leverage authority to escape accountability.
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.580]   We should beware of those who leverage authority
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.500]   to escape accountability.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.420]   Now at first, this woe can seem pretty confusing
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.200]   because things like swearing on the altar
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.820]   versus a swing on the gift on the altar,
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.700]   swearing on the temple versus
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:49.700]   swearing on the gold of the temple
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:53.940]   seems pretty irrelevant to our day and age.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.540]   And yet it would have been totally commonplace
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.060]   for the people that Jesus is speaking to in this moment,
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.200]   not just the crowds,
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.240]   but particularly the Pharisees and the scribes.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.540]   You see, what they would do
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.380]   is they would often make a binding oath.
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.780]   They would commit by way of their word,
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:10.420]   by swearing to something of special significance.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.980]   It would intensify and legitimize the fact
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.220]   that they really meant what they were saying.
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:19.660]   We do this today in a similar modern equivalent
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:23.260]   when we're sworn in for testimony at court.
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.860]   What do you do?
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.740]   You place your hand on the Bible,
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.080]   something significant,
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.140]   and you swear to tell the whole truth
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:32.980]   or the truth, the whole truth,
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:33.820]   and nothing but the truth.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.460]   So help you God, right?
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.900]   That's what we do today.
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:37.820]   We do something similar.
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:41.180]   We commit our way and we legitimize our word
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:42.940]   and our vow and our oath
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.820]   by swearing upon something significant.
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.700]   That's what they're doing.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.980]   That's what Jesus is referencing in this moment.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.060]   And yet what we realize is the Pharisees,
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.140]   they're not just giving their word.
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.380]   They're actually creating a loophole
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:58.620]   to get out of whatever their commitment may be.
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:01.360]   So the way it works is they would swear
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.980]   to something of significance.
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.140]   And yet if they decided that a better offer came
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.420]   or they wanted to get out of their binding oath,
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.180]   they would swear to something of even greater significance.
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.900]   And because it's more significant,
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.160]   this previous oath is invalidated.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.940]   And now I have a new commitment.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.260]   And yet Jesus is looking at him.
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:22.400]   He's saying, no, let your yes be yes.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.140]   Let your no be no.
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.240]   Like God is faithful.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.420]   And so we should be too.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.980]   Like we don't have to base our integrity
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.260]   upon something of significance
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.580]   when all the significance we need is found
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.600]   in the fact that we're made in God's image.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:42.020]   As he is, so we too should be.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.620]   And yet what we know is just as the religious leaders
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.820]   of Jesus' day used their authority to escape accountability,
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.220]   Christians do this today.
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:59.820]   We've all seen it, particularly a lot in the last decade.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:05.300]   Leaders covering up some kind of scandal,
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.220]   pushing away some sort of habitual sin,
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.280]   doing their best to control a narrative
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.140]   or blame shift some accusation
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.400]   that they don't have to take accountability for.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.940]   And yet what we know is this is not the way of Jesus.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.300]   Psalm 15, one, two, it says,
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:27.460]   oh Lord, who shall sojourn in your tent?
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.660]   Who shall dwell on your holy hill?
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.700]   Is he who walks blamelessly and does what is right
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.980]   and speaks truth in his heart.
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.180]   And then you jump to verse four,
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:37.740]   it says who swears to his own hurt and does not change,
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.540]   who gives his word, who gives her word.
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.220]   And even when the going gets tough
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.700]   and this becomes really inconvenient,
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:48.500]   they don't bend, they don't break, they don't flake.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.480]   So I remember when I worked in college ministry,
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.800]   I would meet students all the time
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.300]   that were so excited to hop in
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.140]   with the things we were doing.
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.340]   Like they would learn about the ministry
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.460]   and the opportunities they're in,
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.620]   and they would apply and come to orientation
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.060]   and learn all of our expectations
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.820]   and be super geared up until a better offer would come.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.900]   And then as they proceeded to try and flake out,
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.180]   there would be a series of conversations
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.140]   we would have with one another
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.420]   that always went one of two ways.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.980]   They would come to me and they would say,
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.060]   Kylan, I've really been praying about it.
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.980]   And I just think God's calling me to this.
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.660]   Or they would come to me and say,
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.060]   Kylan, I've really been praying about it.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.860]   I think God is telling me to do that.
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:31.860]   And I, with love in my heart and kindness in my eyes,
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:35.980]   would graciously tell them they're wrong.
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:42.540]   Because God will not say something now
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:46.660]   that disagrees with something he said then.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:50.180]   He tells us when you make your commitment,
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.860]   you hold fast to it.
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.940]   When you say yes, you let it be yes.
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:59.580]   You keep your oath, even to your own hurt.
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.420]   We should be faithful, 'cause he's faithful.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.820]   Like God has never not kept his word, has he?
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.100]   He's always kept his word.
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.500]   He's never covered up some kind of evil, has he?
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.660]   No, he exposes it.
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.340]   He's never kind of snuck out of a commitment
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.300]   that he had at some point in the past.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.500]   No, he honors it, he keeps it.
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.980]   This is who our God is,
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.460]   and this is who the people of God should be.
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:26.700]   And yet so many of us, we become just disenchanted,
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:29.900]   disoriented, disappointed by the fact that,
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:34.220]   man, the Christians I know and the leaders
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.300]   of God's people don't look like this.
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.720]   They sneak around.
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:42.120]   They act more faithlessly than faithfully.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.620]   They do what they know they should not,
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.340]   and yet they don't own up to it.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.560]   They don't take accountability.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.380]   Jesus is looking at us, he's saying,
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.040]   "Don't let this be true of you.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:57.980]   "This is not the way of God, nor is it the way of my people."
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:03.180]   No, we're meant to walk in transparency.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.700]   Like we don't hide aspects of who we are.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:09.980]   We walk in the freedom that the gospel has afforded.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:14.160]   Like we walk in transparency,
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.560]   but we also, we express authenticity.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:22.140]   Like we say what we mean, and we mean what we say,
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.700]   but we don't just do that, we also embrace accountability.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.500]   Like we bring people into our lives,
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.500]   and we give them permission to hold us accountable,
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.580]   to keep us to task, to make sure we're honest,
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.820]   to help us remain reliable.
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:35.840]   Like this is what we do.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.300]   We try to walk in transparency, express authenticity,
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.660]   embrace accountability,
[00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.780]   because this is what Jesus intends for his people.
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:47.160]   He wants us to be knowable, not hidden.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:55.580]   The last thing that he warns us is found in verse 23.
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.260]   It says, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:02.380]   "hypocrites, for you tithe mint and dill and cumin,
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.200]   "and have neglected the weightier matters of the law,
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:09.140]   "justice and mercy and faithfulness.
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.460]   "These you ought to have done
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.900]   "without neglecting the others,
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.840]   "you blind guides, straining on a gnat,
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.220]   "and swallowing a camel."
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.940]   What the heck is he talking about?
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.140]   [congregation laughing]
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.580]   What's the last thing that he wants us to know?
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:24.580]   That we should be aware of those
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.980]   who emphasize small matters over big matters.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.180]   Should be aware of those who emphasize small matters
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:30.180]   over big matters.
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:33.240]   You see, Jesus' criticism here is not
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.320]   that the Pharisees and scribes have tithe,
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.660]   dill, cumin, and mint.
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.300]   He's not getting onto them for doing that.
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.540]   He's not belittling their observance
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.300]   and obedience to the law.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.860]   What he's doing is he's bemoaning the fact
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:49.860]   that they have honored the smallest of things,
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:55.580]   and yet they have dishonored the weightiest of things.
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.180]   They pay attention to the things
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:03.020]   that are so individually insignificant,
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.580]   and in light of doing that,
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.740]   they have missed out on what is
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.820]   eternally significant instead.
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.260]   He's not getting onto them because they're doing
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.660]   what the Old Testament requires.
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:15.740]   They're giving a tenth of what they have to God,
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.560]   even to the degree of measuring out
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.140]   the smallest garden crop possible.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:21.300]   He's not getting onto them for that.
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.620]   He's getting onto them
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:26.820]   because they've forgotten the important things,
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.060]   things that today, here in our world,
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.380]   we too as Christians have forgotten ourselves.
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:38.180]   How much of our witness has the church lost
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:40.220]   because it's focused on immaterial,
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:43.180]   meaningless, and irrelevant matters
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:45.720]   while the world is burning around us?
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:50.020]   Like, I'm not trying to shame anybody here,
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.020]   and I am certainly not trying to make myself
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.820]   the moral example to follow.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.300]   I have plenty of room to grow in this too,
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:01.320]   and yet it looks odd to the watching world
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.780]   when we disagree over doctrinal distinctions
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:06.620]   and denominational differences
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:08.240]   while there are refugee crises
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.120]   in places like Syria and Ukraine.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:15.500]   It looks odd to the world when they watch us
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:20.500]   squabble over social causes of insignificant matter
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.940]   when they know we're called to love the widow
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.100]   and the orphan instead.
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:33.140]   It's odd to the world that we would follow God's allegiance
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.640]   less so than the allegiance we hold
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:40.000]   to some political party or social issue.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.920]   It's confusing.
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.700]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:49.000]   Now, to be clear, I'm not saying that we shouldn't wrestle
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.540]   for theological precision
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.480]   and advocate for objective morality in life
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.520]   or pursue kingdom values for our country.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.320]   We should do all of those things, but here's the thing.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:05.680]   When Christians lose their minds over small things,
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:10.060]   the world loses its faith over big things.
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:15.000]   When we lose our mind over small things,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.520]   the world loses its faith over big things.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.360]   Woe to us if we strain out the gnat
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.360]   and yet we swallow the camel.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.240]   What's Jesus saying there?
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.120]   He's saying, "Woe to you, ugh,
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.800]   "if you choose to be clean in the smallest of matters
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.060]   "and yet you allow yourself to be unclean
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.280]   "in the areas of life that matter most,
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:40.080]   "which are justice, mercy, and faithfulness."
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:44.200]   The prophet Amos recounts it like this from God.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.820]   It says, "I hate, I despise your feasts.
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:51.860]   "I can't stand the stench of your solemn assemblies.
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.360]   "Even if you offer me your burnt offerings
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.560]   "and grain offerings, I will not accept them.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.760]   "I will have no regard for your fellowship offerings
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.420]   "of fattened cattle.
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.300]   "Take away from me the noise of your songs.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.740]   "I will not listen to the music of your harps,
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:09.740]   "but let justice flow like water
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.960]   "and righteousness like an unfailing stream."
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.800]   What good is our religiosity
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.040]   if we forget God's priority porch?
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.760]   What good is it if we're so focused
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.800]   on the things that matter to us
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:29.600]   that we forget the things that matter most to God?
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.500]   What does God care most about?
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.600]   He cares most about people,
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.980]   that which will never perish,
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.080]   that which will go on for eternity.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.960]   Everything in this room, all the material in your life,
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.840]   the things of this earth, they will fade and grow to dust,
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.580]   except for the people next to you.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.840]   God cares about people.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:59.720]   That's why he calls us to justice and mercy and faithfulness.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.000]   Like he cares about justice,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.160]   about righting the wrongs
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.080]   that have been afflicted against people.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:04.960]   He cares about mercy,
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.040]   about lavishing love where those cry the loudest.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.780]   He cares about faithfulness,
[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.200]   about leading people to truth,
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.680]   that he wants a relationship with them
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.520]   so much so that he would have great compassion
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.200]   to race towards them wherever it is they are.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.320]   This is what he cares about.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.280]   And it's what we should care about too.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.680]   We should be purposeful of what's important
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.060]   and not neglectful of it.
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.120]   The last thing that Jesus cares to see.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:35.580]   You know, when Brooke and I were sitting
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.820]   in the middle of Belize,
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:44.640]   on the curbside, right next to Captain Tom
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.000]   in his suspect van,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.420]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:56.080]   I was so convinced there was no way
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.000]   we were going on this ride.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   I thought the whole thing was a farce.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.300]   I felt totally betrayed by the fact
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.440]   that we were showing up for one thing,
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.480]   but we got something else entirely.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.860]   And I was out.
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.120]   I was ready to walk away.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.640]   I was ready to swim back to the ship
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.420]   if that's what it took for me to get as far away
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.840]   from this situation as possible.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.960]   That is until a fellow traveler walked up.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.360]   Someone that had a similar credential
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.660]   from the same cruise that we had come from.
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:30.200]   And he looked at us in the midst
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.100]   of our uncertain situation,
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:35.540]   in the face of the distrust we were feeling.
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:40.540]   And he assured us, hey, this may all look pretty odd.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.760]   It may even feel untrustworthy,
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:51.100]   but what you need to know is the journey's worth it.
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:55.200]   The adventure ahead is everything you hope.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:00.260]   And you don't have to go there alone.
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.600]   I've been there before.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:06.000]   You can trust me, even if you don't trust this,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.460]   and we can go there together.
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:11.920]   So we did.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.540]   And we had an amazing time.
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:20.680]   It was an experience we speak about to this day.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:26.040]   Not because the circumstances around
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:29.760]   or the situation itself seemed trustworthy,
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:34.120]   but because someone showed up who we could trust in
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.880]   that had been where we were
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.440]   and had gone where we were going.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.000]   If you're here and
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.880]   you feel religiously ridiculed, spiritually traumatized,
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.240]   then what you need to know is
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.880]   Jesus is not asking anything of you
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.480]   that he has not done so himself.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.800]   You see, you may be here and you're like,
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.640]   man, I feel so betrayed.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.720]   Like everyone I trusted,
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.960]   like they ruined everything for me.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:04.960]   I thought this was one thing
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.960]   and it ended up being something else.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.880]   And they showed up to be the most untrustworthy
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.140]   and unlikely of people.
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.560]   I feel betrayed and Jesus looks at you and goes,
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.400]   I get it.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.760]   I was betrayed too.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.800]   Not just by those I trusted,
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.660]   but by those who trusted in me.
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:24.200]   They were the ones that sold me out.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.160]   They were the ones who changed my situation.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.200]   They were the ones
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.780]   that left me broken.
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:33.840]   Some of you were here and you feel like,
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.180]   man, I'm so hurt.
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.840]   Like I was taken to places and brought to points
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.120]   that I never thought I would be at.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.040]   And yet Jesus looks at you and goes,
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.400]   hey, I've been hurt too.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.320]   I've been hurt by the religious,
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.840]   the spiritual, the leaders.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.200]   I've been hurt, not just at some point in the past,
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.400]   I have been hurt even to the point of death.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:59.920]   And some of you are here and all you see in your story
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.120]   are religious scars.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.080]   And yet Jesus comes to you and he says,
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.440]   I have those too.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:09.280]   For these scars,
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.840]   for the price of a people such as you.
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:18.160]   If you're here and you're religiously wounded,
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.960]   then know this,
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:25.760]   Jesus heals our religious wounds by his wounds himself.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:29.160]   And he wants to do it with you tonight.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.600]   So let me pray that he would.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.680]   God, I'm grateful.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.840]   When we've all but given up,
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:44.520]   when we feel totally betrayed and we're ready to walk away,
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:48.240]   you chase us down.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:53.560]   When we feel hurt, you bring healing.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:57.680]   When we feel wronged, you come to make it right.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.040]   This is your heart, God.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:04.000]   And it's a heart that God, we want to be reacquainted with
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.360]   if we have grown distant from it at any time in the past.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.200]   So God, I pray that you would do it here tonight.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.680]   I pray that you would do it right now in this moment.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.360]   I thank God about the opportunity for healing in this place.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.920]   And I'm asking you, God, please, would you do that?
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:23.000]   Would you provide a healing balm
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.120]   to the broken parts of our lives?
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.840]   Would you lead us, God, back to a place
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.840]   where we have restored relationship in you
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.000]   and a restored relationship to your people?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.240]   We love you, God.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.640]   And we want to deal with you now.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.320]   It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.560]   Hey, porch, let's stand to our feet real fast.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.480]   Hey, one thing that I realized
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.280]   as I was making my way through that sermon
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.600]   is there was no way we were gonna get through
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.960]   all seven woes, and so we took four tonight.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.480]   We'll clean up the last three
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.160]   the next time we are all together.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.320]   I think this is a topic
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.520]   that deserves a little bit more time anyways.
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.400]   Some of you are really wrestling
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.800]   with some of the ideas we've spoken about tonight,
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.480]   some things that resonated with you,
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:08.120]   and yet you're not real sure how to process them.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.960]   What we wanna encourage you to do is,
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:14.760]   is to wrestle well,
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.840]   which often means you don't wrestle alone.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:21.120]   Maybe a conversation, an internal dialogue
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:24.560]   has stirred up within that you need to get out.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.240]   We've got a team down here to the front,
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.480]   my right and my left, that would love to process with you.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.840]   You will not tell us something that we haven't heard before.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.680]   You will not tell us anything that we haven't heard.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.440]   Anything that catches us off guard.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:40.600]   But this is an opportunity for healing,
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.400]   and so we wanna give you a place
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.480]   where you can do that at whatever pace
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.400]   feels most helpful as we sing together.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.920]   So let's do that together now.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:58.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
