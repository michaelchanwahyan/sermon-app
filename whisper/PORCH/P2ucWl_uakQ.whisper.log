[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:26.320]   What's up, Porch?
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.320]   How are we doing tonight?
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.800]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.160]   You guys out there just want to make sure.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.120]   How we doing?
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.160]   OK.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.800]   Hey, good to see you.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.720]   If this is your first time ever at the Porch, welcome.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.040]   I am glad you made it.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.680]   Thank you for trusting us with your Tuesday night.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.240]   My name is Timothy Atik, and I'm one of the teaching pastors
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.080]   here at Watermark on Sundays, as well as here
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.080]   on Tuesdays at the Porch.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.960]   I want to give a special shout out to all of our Porch Live
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.920]   locations tuning in at different places in the nation.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.520]   I'm thinking about Porch Live Cincinnati tonight,
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.880]   Porch Live Tulsa, Porch Live Scottsdale.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.320]   So glad y'all are tuning in.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.840]   I also just want to give a special hello
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.040]   to our deaf and hard of hearing friends that
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.280]   are in the room tonight.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.960]   So I'm just going to try something new out tonight.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.360]   I don't know how it's going to go,
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.760]   but I'm going to give it a whirl.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.040]   OK?
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.520]   We are glad that you are here.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.320]   Thanks for coming.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.640]   Hey, I want you to know, let's be clear.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.600]   If you have any friends that are deaf or hard of hearing,
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.320]   they belong here at the Porch.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.560]   They belong here, not just on one night, every Tuesday night.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.440]   So make sure that they know that we
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.560]   have a place for them to come and worship with us.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.000]   So several years ago, my wife and I,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.200]   we made a very, very unfortunate decision
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.800]   that I want to share with you tonight.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.960]   We chose to try and fly on an airplane with a small child.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.440]   And that's it.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.520]   That was a poor decision.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.000]   You should never make that decision ever in your life.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.480]   Because here's the reality.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.120]   When you are traveling with an infant,
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.440]   you are basically handing that child all of the control.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.760]   And your trip just became one big coin toss, that is.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.280]   Like, it's a game.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.760]   You're either going to come out a big time winner or a big time
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.260]   loser.
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.400]   And Cat and I, we came out massive losers.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.240]   We were traveling from Austin to Birmingham, Alabama
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.240]   with our first son Noah, who was about eight months old
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.400]   at the time.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.960]   And we came out major losers.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.840]   It was the type of thing that when we landed in Birmingham,
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.400]   we felt like we had flown to Europe and had jet lag.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.080]   We were contemplating only vacationing
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.880]   from that point forward in either Waco or San Antonio
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.720]   for about the next 18 years.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.120]   Because it was so miserable.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.320]   We were on the flight.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.120]   And for the majority of the flight,
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.720]   Noah was just losing his ever-loving mind.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.640]   And we were trying everything that we
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.680]   could to just help him get comfortable and calm down.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.360]   And that just wasn't working.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.040]   And so it was a frantic situation.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.920]   And because it was a frantic situation, I was frantic.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.160]   And Catherine was frantic.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.280]   So we were frantic individually.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.840]   And then we were frantic collectively.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.680]   And I guess that people around us
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.600]   could tell, because at the end of the flight,
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.240]   a man slid a note through the seat to me.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.840]   And I opened up the note.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.560]   And on the note was a drawing.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.360]   And the drawing was of a triangle.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.480]   And at the top of the triangle was the word God.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.160]   And then in the two corners was husband and wife.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.640]   And then there was a note that said,
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.840]   the closer you get to God, the closer
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.320]   you will get to each other.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.440]   Now that's an interesting note to get when you're a pastor.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.520]   I don't know what you do with that.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.880]   I was like, no duh, sign Pastor Timothy Attiq.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.480]   And I folded up and handed it back.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.160]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.600]   But when I think about that experience, here's the reality.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.960]   That guy was watching us.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.880]   And at least in that moment, that guy
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.960]   could not see Jesus at work in my life.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.080]   That's what you call, at least for that moment,
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.560]   that's what you call hypocrisy.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.720]   Hypocrisy is knowing the truth and not living the truth.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.280]   At least in that moment, I was struggling
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.040]   as a pastor with hypocrisy.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.840]   I was a person that knew Jesus, but I wasn't living like I did.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.800]   I knew the truth, but I wasn't living the truth.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.360]   There was information here, but there was no application here.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.600]   And I tell you that because, hey, here's the reality.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.640]   If you're a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.880]   we're all going to have times in our lives
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.040]   where we struggle with hypocrisy.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.560]   And if you're not a Christian and you're like,
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.440]   that's why I'm not a Christian,
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.960]   because when you look at different Christians,
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.040]   you're like, sometimes what you say you believe
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.560]   doesn't match how you live.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.920]   And so I'll just apologize on behalf of all Christians.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.440]   It's something that we're going to be working on
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.920]   for the rest of our lives.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.440]   We never claim to be perfect.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.040]   We only claim to know the one who is perfect,
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.280]   and that's Jesus Christ, who came
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.920]   and he was perfect in our place.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.800]   And he made a way when there was no way
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.720]   for very imperfect people to be made right
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.400]   with a perfect God.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.960]   But the reality is that we're all going to have times
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.880]   where what we know doesn't match how we live.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.000]   So if you think back to science in high school,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.640]   if you think about the classroom
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.640]   and you think about the lab,
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.920]   if Tuesday nights are the classroom
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.920]   and the rest of the week is the lab
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.920]   where we go out and live what we learned in the classroom,
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.480]   sometimes we struggle in the lab.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.440]   Interestingly, as we step back
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.320]   into the book of Ecclesiastes tonight,
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.760]   and we listen to the wisest man to ever walk the face
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.040]   of the earth besides Jesus Christ,
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.880]   as we listen to the words of King Solomon,
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.840]   you know what he's gonna say?
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.280]   He's gonna say, "Hey, the problem goes even deeper.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.960]   "The issue isn't just that we struggle in the lab.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.440]   "We can actually struggle in the classroom."
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.560]   So we don't just struggle with hypocrisy sometimes
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.080]   when we go out and live out the rest of our weeks.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.080]   We can actually struggle with hypocrisy
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.080]   doing what we're doing right now,
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.640]   like when we gather together on Sundays for worship
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.760]   or we gather together on Tuesday nights for the porch.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.760]   And so tonight is gonna be a very unique type of message.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.560]   Like it might throw some of you off
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.760]   because you're kind of looking for the truth
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.480]   that you need to go out and live.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.320]   And I'm actually gonna talk about the truth
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.560]   that you need to come in and apply
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.440]   when you come to the porch or you come to church.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.480]   Like I wanna talk about Solomon
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.480]   as he's going to instruct us in how we live here.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.960]   Because here's the reality,
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.760]   God cares a lot about what is happening right now
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.720]   on Tuesday night.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.400]   He cares a lot about what is going on with you
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.280]   in this moment.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.840]   He cares deeply about it.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.500]   And so tonight might feel a little bit uncomfortable
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.960]   because we're gonna talk about the hypocrisy
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.720]   that might even be happening in our lives
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.320]   and in our hearts right now, right this second.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.320]   And that's okay.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.640]   Because while we wanna identify the hypocrisy,
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.440]   like we have an opportunity even in this moment to pivot
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.560]   and move towards authenticity in relating to God
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.880]   even right now.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.260]   So because this is gonna be a different type of message,
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.520]   here's what I wanna do.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.160]   I wanna ask everyone in the room to take a moment
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.000]   and just pray for yourself.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.160]   Just real quick, take a second and just say,
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.900]   "God, would you speak to me tonight?"
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.740]   Just pray those words,
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.080]   "God, please speak to me tonight."
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:26.640]   Lord, I pray that you would do just that.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.800]   That our ears would be open,
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.080]   that our hearts would be receptive
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.360]   to whatever you wanna say to us.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.680]   Speak to us now in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.280]   Hey, if you're here and you're not a Christian,
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.880]   this is actually a great night for you to be here
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.440]   because tonight you're really gonna at least
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.160]   get an explanation for why we're even doing this.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.120]   Like why thousands of young adults
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.600]   chose to get all of their steps
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.300]   in just walking from the parking garage
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.680]   to this building tonight.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.600]   Like what's the point?
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.880]   Why are we doing this?
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.240]   You're gonna find that out right now.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.240]   If you have a Bible, turn with me to Ecclesiastes.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.360]   Chapter five, Ecclesiastes chapter five.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.280]   We're gonna be looking tonight at verses one through seven.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:12.280]   King Solomon is going to address how we worship
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.520]   when we come together on Tuesdays and Sundays.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.760]   Here's what he says.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.820]   Verse one of chapter five, he says,
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:27.820]   "Guard your steps when you go to the house of God
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.860]   "to draw near to listen is better than to offer
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.360]   "the sacrifice of fools,
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.680]   "for they do not know that they are doing evil.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.920]   "Be not rash with your mouth,
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.780]   "nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God.
[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.620]   "For God is in heaven and you are on earth,
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.900]   "therefore let your words be few.
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.020]   "For a dream comes with much business
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.040]   "in a fool's voice with many words.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.640]   "When you vow a vow to God, do not delay paying it,
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.440]   "for he has no pleasure in fools.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.180]   "Pay what you vow.
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.880]   "It's better that you should not vow
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.520]   "than that you should vow and not pay.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.000]   "Let not your mouth lead you into sin
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.080]   "and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.280]   "Why should God be angry at your voice
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.780]   "and destroy the work of your hands?
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.620]   "For when dreams increase and words grow many,
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:22.080]   "there is vanity, but God is the one you must fear."
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.040]   Solomon is targeting our hypocrisy
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.840]   when we come together to worship.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.240]   So tonight what I wanna do is I wanna look at this passage
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.280]   and give you five keys to moving away from hypocrisy
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.640]   and moving towards authenticity
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.240]   when we come together to worship.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.960]   Okay, the first key is this,
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.960]   true worship ascribes worth to God, not man.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.860]   True worship, when we come together, when we sing,
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.280]   when we open up the Bible,
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.280]   true worship ascribes worth to God, not man.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.680]   Look again at what Solomon says in verse one.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.980]   He says, "Guard your steps when you go to the house of God."
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.040]   Why is he saying that?
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.160]   All he's saying is,
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.800]   "Hey, when you come to the porch on Tuesday nights,
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.460]   "think about what you're doing.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.980]   "Be careful, take caution.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.680]   "Don't go into the porch flippantly."
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.520]   Why?
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.140]   Because God cares what is happening here.
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.600]   God cares about it.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.360]   God cares about the quality of our worship.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.920]   And then he goes on in verse one
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.760]   and look at what he says.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.920]   The wording is very important.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.920]   He says, "To draw near to listen is better."
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.840]   It's better than what?
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.760]   It's better than to offer the sacrifice of fools.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.000]   And so Solomon is basically saying,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.240]   "Hey, there's two different ways to worship
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.580]   "on a Tuesday night or a Sunday morning,
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.960]   "and one is much better than the other."
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.920]   The better way, the true worship,
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.560]   is one where when you come on Tuesday night,
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.880]   you are drawing near.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.180]   The wording is you are drawing near to listen.
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.920]   The question you should be asking right now
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.660]   is to listen to who?
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:09.640]   Like just evaluate, who did you come here tonight to hear?
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.480]   Like it is our conviction here at the porch.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.440]   And I think what Solomon is getting at
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.360]   is when you gather together,
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.900]   you come with the conviction that God is here.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.040]   God is here and he wants to speak to you.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.560]   Did you come tonight with the expectation
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.000]   that the God of the universe
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.640]   actually wants to speak into your heart tonight?
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.400]   The reason that we teach the Bible every single week
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.240]   is that we believe that this book
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.640]   is actually the word of God.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.480]   Like God went to great lengths to give it to us
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.940]   so that he could speak to us through it
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.600]   as we open it and study it together.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.000]   And so we are convinced that God is here.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.320]   He wants to meet with us.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.880]   He wants to speak to you and to me.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.600]   And yet we can often come together and worship
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.900]   for other reasons than to hear from God.
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.420]   I remember years ago when I was in my early 20s,
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.680]   my best friend and I,
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.480]   we decided to drive out to Denton to a church
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.480]   where Tommy Nelson,
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.080]   who spoke at the beginning of the Ecclesiastes series,
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.680]   we drove out to his church.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.080]   We had heard a lot of great things about Tommy Nelson.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.080]   We totally wanted to hear him.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.360]   So we made the 45 minute drive out there
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.280]   and we sat through the worship.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.280]   And then someone other than Tommy Nelson got up to speak.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.820]   And when that guy got up, we got up.
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.280]   And now like I cringe thinking about it,
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.880]   doing what I'm doing right now.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.540]   'Cause that guy got up, everyone is seated,
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.600]   everything's quiet and we're like,
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.840]   yeah, it's time to go to dinner.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.960]   So we stood up and we left.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.080]   Why?
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.480]   We weren't there to hear from God.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.220]   We were there to hear from Tommy Nelson.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.600]   So my question to you is,
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.560]   who did you come here tonight to hear from?
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.260]   Did you come to hear from me?
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.920]   Did you come to hear from the porch band?
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.840]   Some of y'all are like, I didn't come to hear from anyone.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.160]   I came to meet someone and her name or his name
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.340]   is not Jesus.
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.740]   And that's fine.
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.400]   Like if that's what God you hear,
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.160]   hey, I'm glad you made it.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160]   And I hope that that works out for you.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.680]   But now that you're here,
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.360]   let me just encourage you to trade up.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.920]   Trade up to an even better meeting.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.880]   Like trade up from something natural
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.840]   to something supernatural.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.020]   Where the Lord of Lords and King of Kings
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.720]   actually wants to meet you tonight
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.520]   and wants to speak to your heart.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.400]   Who did you come to hear?
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.240]   I'll just say this.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.840]   One of my concerns with your generation
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.760]   is that we live in a time
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.480]   where Christians are being celebritized.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.200]   Like we are turning normal followers of Jesus
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   into celebrities.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.600]   But I don't find that anywhere in the Bible.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.500]   Like when I look in the book of Acts,
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.760]   which is where the people who started the church,
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.960]   like if anyone was going to be a Christian celebrity,
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.840]   it would be the guys that got this thing kicked off.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.680]   It's the guys that, like Peter, when he spoke,
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.280]   3,000 people became Christians just like that, one message.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.400]   And yet when I look at these guys,
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.020]   these guys aren't being exalted.
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.120]   These guys are getting stoned.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.120]   And I'm not talking about that type of stone.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.760]   Some of y'all, for a minute there,
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.520]   you were like, the Bible has never made more sense to me
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.360]   than right now.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.060]   That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.920]   I'm talking about rocks being thrown.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.800]   Enough of them that the people throwing them
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.240]   think that the people they're throwing them at are dead.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.200]   And then those people that they think are dead,
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.400]   once the stone throwers are gone,
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.440]   they just get up and move to the next town
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.600]   and keep preaching the gospel.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.640]   And many of them ended up dying for preaching the gospel.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.600]   And yet we find ourselves in this point in history
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.160]   where there's a lot of podcasting,
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.080]   there's a lot of following and reposting,
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:19.800]   and there's a lot of church hopping where it's like,
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.840]   where are the best speakers speaking?
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.240]   And you hear that someone's gonna be here,
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.520]   and so you go and listen to that.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.560]   And there's a lot of listening,
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.120]   and there's a lot of celebritizing.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.720]   But there's little life change.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.240]   And so let me just encourage you,
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.600]   don't turn messengers into messiahs.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.960]   They are terrible messiahs.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.960]   They are sinners just like you and me.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.600]   They are trying to follow Jesus one day at a time
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.200]   just like you and me.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.560]   God has given them something to steward.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.280]   God has entrusted them with a gift,
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.280]   and that gift exists for them to glorify Christ.
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:09.480]   And so join them as they seek to glorify Christ,
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.520]   but don't glorify them as they glorify Christ.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.640]   Don't be more in tune
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.440]   with what your favorite Christian celebrity is saying
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.560]   than what the word of God says.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.240]   'Cause in the end, when you stand before Jesus,
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.160]   it's not gonna work for you to be like,
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.680]   well, you know what JP says?
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.560]   Jesus is gonna be like, yeah, I know him.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.880]   Do you know me?
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.040]   Okay.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.280]   So what's the better way?
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.280]   What did we say?
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.280]   We said true worship ascribes worth to God, not man.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:57.520]   The word worship descends from a Saxon word
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.040]   that eventually became the word worth-ship,
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.200]   which I think is really telling about what true worship is
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.800]   because true worship is ascribing the proper worth to God.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.360]   So when we come to the porch to worship,
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.320]   here's what we're saying.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.960]   We're saying, Jesus Christ, you're worth it.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.680]   You're worth it for me to park in that parking garage
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.120]   on the third story and walk down all those stairs
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.640]   and across the parking lot.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.960]   You're worth it.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.800]   You're worth it for me to fight traffic.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.000]   You're worth it for me to skip dinner
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.960]   because I was running late out of work.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.160]   You're worth it for me to put work on hold
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.200]   for a couple of hours.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.080]   You're worth it for me to come into this place
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.360]   and find a seat.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.600]   You're worth it for me to tune everything else
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.720]   out in my life.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.320]   You're worth it for me to put my phone on do not disturb.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.000]   You are worth it for me to lift my hands in praise
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.440]   or to get on my knees.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.740]   You are worth all of it.
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:48.640]   That's who you are.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.840]   You are worthy of it.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.600]   You are worth it.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.600]   That's what we wanna do when we gather together here.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.720]   We're not just here to like have a big event
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.480]   to see how many people we can get into this place
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.120]   'cause if we all gather together
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.400]   and we all snap a picture that we were here
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.040]   but no one seeks Jesus more,
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.380]   this was a royal waste of time.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.840]   And so we are here to meet with God.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.920]   Here's the reality.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.960]   If the God of the universe wants to speak to me,
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.480]   I don't wanna hear from anyone else.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.980]   And I hope that that's true for you as well.
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.040]   Think about this.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.020]   What will your story be tonight?
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.720]   Like when you leave here and you go home,
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.480]   if you walk in and your roommate was like,
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.240]   what'd you do tonight?
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.160]   Like your story could be, you know what?
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.080]   I had an encounter with the God of the universe.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.320]   What have you been up to?
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.160]   That's a pretty good story.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.800]   It's a pretty good night.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.860]   True worship ascribes worth to God, not man.
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.800]   Number two, true worship has no autopilot.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.840]   True worship has no autopilot.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.900]   Like we are not trying to compete with Tesla here.
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:03.560]   Tesla is trying to make life efficient.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.900]   You can push a button and the car will drive itself
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.100]   so you can do whatever you want.
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:15.100]   Autopilot enables you to multitask, to do other things.
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.940]   That doesn't work when it comes to worship.
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.780]   True worship has no autopilot.
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.120]   Look again at Solomon's wording in verse one.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.620]   He says, "To draw near to listen is better than," what?
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.180]   "It's better than to offer the sacrifice of fools,"
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.220]   which begs the question, what's the sacrifice of fools?
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.620]   Well, the sacrifice of fools is simply the opposite
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.560]   of drawing near to listen.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.800]   So if God is here and he wants to meet with us,
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.260]   if he wants to speak to us,
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:46.960]   then the sacrifice of fools must be going to all the effort
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.400]   to come into this place and leaving.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.340]   Like you walk across the parking lot, you find your seat,
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.660]   you sit for an hour and a half,
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.380]   and then you walk back across the parking lot
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:02.140]   and you sit through traffic and you never meet with God.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.100]   That's the sacrifice of fools.
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.100]   Here's the reality.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.500]   It's a lot easier than you think
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.620]   to offer the sacrifice of fools.
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:14.620]   I'm a pastor and I am confessing that over the years,
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.980]   there have been plenty of times where I've gone to church
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.500]   and gotten nothing out of it,
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.180]   and it has been 100% my fault.
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.860]   'Cause the worship has been great, that's not the issue.
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.280]   People have been preaching the word of God faithfully,
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.980]   they've been proclaiming the gospel.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.420]   The issue hasn't been with what's going on,
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.140]   it's been with what's going on with me.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.620]   So what can it look like to offer the sacrifice of fools
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:43.460]   here at the porch?
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:47.280]   Well, what it looks like is you're coming in hot,
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.180]   the first song has started,
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.420]   and so it takes you kind of the first song
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.100]   to text your friends and to find your seat
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.940]   and to just get settled.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.860]   And then the second song gets going,
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.220]   and you click into autopilot worship pretty quickly,
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.780]   which is amazing,
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:10.260]   because you will be singing every word to every song
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.500]   while your mind is somewhere totally different.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.620]   Like you can be singing every word and you're like,
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.740]   oh my gosh, I've got so much to do tonight
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.900]   and I'm way behind on laundry and I haven't eaten,
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.540]   so where am I gonna eat tonight?
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.660]   And it really bothers me that she said that
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.380]   and I can't believe that he did that and she's wearing that,
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.100]   that's crazy, and he's good looking,
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.580]   and your brain can be everywhere
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.600]   while you are singing every word to every song,
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.820]   that's autopilot worship.
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.500]   And then we pray and then I come up
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.140]   and I've got about one or two minutes
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.660]   to captivate your attention before some of y'all be like,
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.060]   you know, he's not that funny tonight
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.020]   and I don't know if I'm really feeling
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.000]   what he's talking about,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.380]   so maybe this is a good time for me to leave
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.220]   because I still do have all that work
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.020]   and it would be nice to get a jump on my laundry
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:01.100]   and if you stick it out and I pray
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.740]   and then we get into the response song,
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.060]   you're like, now's my time to get a jump on traffic.
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.340]   If I don't leave now and get out of here early,
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:12.940]   I'm gonna be sitting in a line out of that parking garage.
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:17.060]   And so from the time you got here to the time you leave,
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:22.820]   nothing happens, there's no connection with God.
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.620]   What a waste of a night.
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.400]   What a waste of a night.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.620]   It's not worth it, there's something
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.660]   so much better here for you.
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.460]   Like we're just inviting you to reject autopilot worship,
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.940]   why, because the Lord of Lords and King of Kings is here.
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:43.060]   He wants to meet with us, he wants to speak to you.
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:46.980]   So we're just inviting you in to more.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:47.860]   Number three.
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:56.180]   True worship is honest, it's honest.
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:00.080]   Look back at what Solomon says in verses two and three.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.380]   He says this, "Be not rash with your mouth,
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:09.920]   "nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God,
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.420]   "for God is in heaven and you are on earth.
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.220]   "Therefore let your words be few,
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.960]   "for a dream comes with much business
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.860]   "and a fool's voice with many voices."
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.200]   So Solomon is now targeting the words
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.740]   that actually come out of our mouths
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.020]   when we are singing songs together on a Tuesday night
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.500]   or on Sunday morning, and here's his point.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.500]   Because you are talking to God, think before you speak.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.920]   Because God actually cares about the words
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.060]   coming out of your mouth.
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.440]   Like he cares what we say in this moment.
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.760]   God is most glorified when what comes out of our mouth
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.320]   on Tuesday nights or Sunday mornings is honest.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.680]   That we aren't saying things that aren't actually true.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.560]   But here's the thing, if we're not careful,
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.760]   then we might find ourselves in an emotional moment
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.200]   just saying something that we don't actually believe.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.520]   It's kind of like this.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.880]   Like some of y'all might find yourself
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.280]   in a dating relationship where y'all kind of
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.880]   jump headfirst into this thing,
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.440]   and it gets very serious very quickly.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.240]   Where you guys are spending all of your time together
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:24.380]   every single day, and it gets very physical
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.920]   and very emotional very quickly.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.840]   And so some of y'all might find yourself
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.220]   a month into dating, and it's late at night,
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.640]   and you're having this very physical,
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.160]   very emotional moment, and the only thing
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.000]   that seems right to say in that moment is,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   I love you, and as it comes out of your mouth,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   you're like, no, but it's already out.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.720]   And then in the morning, you wake up
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.840]   and check your phone, and it's like,
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.560]   I love you, my perfect man, and you're like,
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.800]   gosh, that escalated quickly.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.660]   And you said something in an emotional moment
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.760]   that you didn't actually believe.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.680]   Some of y'all are like, you are in my head.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.200]   I can't help you with that situation,
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.260]   but when it comes to what's happening in here,
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.960]   maybe I can come down afterward, we'll talk about it.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.660]   But here's the thing, the same thing can happen here.
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.520]   I mean, we've got this massive LED screen,
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.640]   we've got lights, we've got smoke,
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.120]   we've got an amazing band that leads us,
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.340]   amazing worship leaders.
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:38.700]   It's loud, there's energy, look around,
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.700]   and everyone's got their hands raised.
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.320]   And in that moment, it can be so emotional
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.800]   that you find yourself singing words to songs
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.560]   that you don't actually believe.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.440]   I mean, just think about what we have sang tonight.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:58.120]   Like one of the songs that we sang tonight,
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.280]   here's what we said.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.900]   We said, oh, I'm not here for blessings.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.120]   Jesus, you don't owe me anything.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.100]   And more than anything you can do, I just want you.
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.320]   I just want you.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.460]   Is that like nothing else?
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.980]   It says nothing else, nothing else will do,
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.060]   I just want you.
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.780]   Is that what you really believe?
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:25.900]   Like I don't want anything else.
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:31.440]   Like Jesus, if you don't give me another thing in my life,
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.700]   if you don't give me a boyfriend or girlfriend,
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.260]   if you don't give me a job, it doesn't matter
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.200]   because the thing that I want most is you.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:44.760]   Or maybe the right words instead of nothing else,
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.880]   it was something else, something else will do,
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.280]   but it's not you.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.360]   You know, maybe that was more what we,
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.780]   if we were honest.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.760]   Or like this, and I don't know if this is gonna connect
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:02.600]   with you guys or not, but over the years,
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:07.040]   do you wanna know what song people have messaged me,
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:12.040]   asked me about the most, asking if we could sing it
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.380]   in the different ministries I've led,
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.600]   do you wanna know what the number one song is?
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.540]   Over the years of working with college students,
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.380]   do you know what it is?
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.600]   It's the song "Oceans."
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.920]   I don't know if you remember the song "Oceans."
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.800]   Some of y'all, if we sang "Oceans," you would be wrecked.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.280]   You would just be weeping.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.300]   You'd just be on the floor.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:38.500]   But I want you to think about what you're singing
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.500]   when you sing "Oceans."
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.180]   Here's the words.
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:48.180]   Spirit, lead me where my trust is without borders.
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.780]   Let me walk upon the waters wherever you would call me.
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:55.860]   Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander,
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.740]   and my faith will be made stronger
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.000]   in the presence of my Savior.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.260]   Do you understand what you're saying?
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.580]   You're saying, "God, I want you to take me to a place
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.720]   "where I don't know what's happening.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.800]   "It's very, like, it's unpredictable.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.060]   "It can feel unstable.
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.700]   "I can't see the result.
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.020]   "I can't see how things are gonna turn out.
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.900]   "I can't see if all my dreams are gonna be fulfilled,
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.260]   "but I'm there, and you're there,
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.140]   "and that's all that matters, and that's all I want.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.020]   "I just wanna be led by you.
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.460]   "I just want you, but right now,
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.800]   "I just want you to lead me
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.420]   "where my trust is without borders."
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.020]   Is that really what you want?
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.580]   If so, awesome, that's a great song to sing.
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.880]   That's a great prayer to pray.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.460]   But what we don't want is you've got the lights,
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.900]   and you've got the screens, and so you're like,
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.020]   "Yeah, I guess so, yeah, let's do it."
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:52.860]   And then you walk out, and you're like, "Not exactly that."
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.740]   You know what I wonder is sometimes
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.100]   the most worshipful thing we can do
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:06.940]   during the time of singing is to just be honest with God,
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:10.240]   like to just look at the words and to just say,
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.080]   "God, I don't think I'm there yet,
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.740]   "but I wanna get there."
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:18.840]   Or maybe, "God, you know what, I'm singing this,
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.020]   "not because it's true now,
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.040]   "but because I'm singing it in faith
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.180]   "that you, by the power of your Spirit,
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.500]   "could help it become true."
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.900]   Or what would it look like, honestly,
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.620]   for you to say, "God, I need you to know
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:32.060]   "for the last 10 minutes, I've only been thinking
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.540]   "about what other people are thinking about me,
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.020]   "because we all think that everyone
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.820]   "is always looking at us.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.620]   "And so, honestly, I've been singing and worshiping
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:43.940]   "for the approval of other people,
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.020]   "that other people would look at me
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.740]   "and think that I'm one of the spiritual people in the room."
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.900]   Or what would it look like to just be honest and say,
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.360]   "God, I'm playing games with you,
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.920]   "because I want something from you.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.200]   "So I feel like if I get here and I go
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.960]   "to all the effort to be here and I sing passionately,
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.420]   "then you're finally gonna give me what I'm asking for."
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:09.620]   Or maybe, what if you were just honest and say,
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:14.620]   "God, I feel so much guilt, I feel so much shame,
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.600]   "I feel so unworthy of being here.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.180]   "I feel like you don't wanna have anything to do with me,
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.860]   "so how could I even begin to sing these songs?
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.940]   "Would you do something in my life?
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.620]   "Would you forgive me?
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.200]   "Would you wash me clean?
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.580]   "Would you give me a new start?"
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.580]   That's honest, that is worship.
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.660]   That is true worship.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.820]   Solomon's message is, "Hey, think before you speak.
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.180]   "Think before you speak."
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.020]   Why?
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.500]   Look back at the wording.
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.560]   What does he say?
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:49.020]   He says, "Be not rash," this is verse two,
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.180]   "Be not rash with your mouth,
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.180]   "nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God."
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.020]   Why?
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:58.060]   "For God is in heaven and you are on earth."
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:02.700]   He's just saying, "Hey, don't be too casual
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.100]   "when you're talking to the God of the universe."
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.260]   Sometimes the best thing we can do
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.100]   when we come into a moment like this is to just pause.
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.820]   That's why every Tuesday night,
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.820]   I don't know if you've noticed it,
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.200]   but one of the worship leaders, whenever we start,
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.560]   they always just give a moment.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.580]   If you could just be quiet before the Lord, why?
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:24.860]   It's a great opportunity to just remind yourself
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.780]   of who you're meeting with.
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.340]   You're reminding yourself of who you're talking to.
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:33.720]   So it's good to remind yourself that our God is Father,
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.740]   Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:41.400]   He's a perfect Father who is loving and forgiving,
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:45.420]   and he delights in meeting with his children.
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.460]   He's Jesus.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.540]   He's Savior.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.380]   He's friend.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.620]   God is Holy Spirit, which means he's counselor and helper.
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.860]   And at the exact same time,
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:03.500]   Jesus is also the King of kings and Lord of lords.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.540]   And the God that we're meeting with is the same God
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:10.660]   that the nation of Israel met with
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.860]   at the base of Mount Sinai.
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.820]   I don't know if you've ever read this in the Old Testament,
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:20.300]   but God speaks from the mountain.
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:24.620]   And the nation of Israel hears God speak audibly,
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.900]   and for them, it is a near-death experience.
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.260]   They run to Moses and they're like,
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.020]   "If God speaks again, I don't think we're gonna live,
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:32.920]   "so here's the deal.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.300]   "We trust you.
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.100]   "You go talk to God for us."
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:36.940]   Good luck with that.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:39.320]   "You go talk to him, and then you come back
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.540]   "and tell us what he says."
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.900]   It's the same God that John in Revelation,
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.160]   when he sees Jesus, he falls on his face,
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.420]   and he's like, "I think I'm dead."
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.620]   And Jesus is like, "You're not dead, man.
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:50.460]   "Get up."
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:51.500]   [congregation laughing]
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.580]   It's the same God.
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:56.540]   He's loving, forgiving, gracious.
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:01.540]   And at the same time, he is holy, holy, holy.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.940]   So I'm gonna put this on the screen
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.220]   because I don't want you to miss it.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:10.220]   Okay, because God is holy,
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.700]   because he is holy,
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:16.180]   because he is holy, holy, holy,
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:21.120]   let your words be few and sincere
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.400]   instead of many and fake.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.260]   Okay, because God is holy, holy, holy,
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.060]   let your words be few and sincere
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.040]   instead of many and fake.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:36.860]   Number four, true worship impacts tomorrow.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.100]   It changes tomorrow.
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.620]   Look at what Solomon goes on to say in verse four.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.100]   It says, "When you vow a vow to God,
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.940]   "do not delay paying it,
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.840]   "for he has no pleasure in fools.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.860]   "Pay what you vow.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.520]   "It's better that you should not vow
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.240]   "than that you should vow and not pay.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.240]   "Let not your mouth lead you into sin.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.120]   "Don't say before the messenger that it was a mistake.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.820]   "Why should God be angry at your voice
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:05.400]   "and destroy the work of your hands?"
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.060]   Here's what he's saying.
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:10.100]   He's saying, "Do what you say you're going to do
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:10.940]   "and do it quickly."
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:12.620]   So here's what's really happening.
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.440]   Don't miss this.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.480]   This is so important.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.780]   There's gonna be times where you come into this place
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.260]   and you're meeting with God
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.620]   and you're gonna sense that God is calling you
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.920]   to do something very important.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.540]   He's gonna call you to do something important.
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.940]   So maybe even tonight you sense
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:31.780]   like you came into this place kind of one foot in
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.740]   and one foot out of Christianity.
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.580]   Maybe you've put Jesus on the back burner of your life
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:39.540]   and you just sense that Jesus is reaching into your life
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.220]   saying, "You're with me.
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:44.020]   "Go all in with me.
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:46.200]   "Surrender fully to me.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:51.200]   "I want you and I want you, all of you to come with me."
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.440]   Or maybe you sense that God is reaching in just saying,
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:00.040]   "It's time to get out of that toxic, unhealthy relationship."
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.440]   Or maybe you sense that God is calling you
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.640]   to go on the mission field.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.360]   Or maybe you sense that God is calling you
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.480]   to forgive someone that you've harbored bitterness,
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.440]   anger, and resentment towards for years.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.380]   Maybe you sense that he's finally calling you
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.540]   out of an addiction to pornography.
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.920]   So you need to go to Regen on Monday night
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.280]   or go to Courageous Hope if you're a woman
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.420]   who's experienced sexual abuse.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.700]   Or maybe you need to go to one of the other ministries here,
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.440]   Divorce Care, if you're a single mom in the room.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.340]   Or Grief Share if you've lost a loved one.
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.020]   Or maybe he's calling you out of isolation
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.500]   and he's calling you to membership here at Watermark
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.820]   or to get into a community group.
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:46.620]   And here's the thing, God, in moments like this,
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:47.900]   he can be very clear.
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.780]   And as he speaks into our lives,
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.700]   we might find ourselves in the moment saying,
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.340]   "Yes, God, I want to go all in with you.
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:58.300]   Yes, I agree I need to get out of this relationship.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.620]   Yes, God, I want to do what you're asking me to do."
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:05.860]   But if we don't go and do it quickly,
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.180]   then a fog can kind of roll into our minds
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:11.500]   and our enemies, Satan, can begin to lie to us.
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.780]   And he can tell us things like,
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.580]   "Can you really imagine your life
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.140]   without him or her in it?
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:21.380]   Can you imagine how much you would be acquiescing
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:25.540]   if you went and forgave that person who hurt you?
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.540]   Can you imagine what people would think of you
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.260]   if you confessed that sin?"
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.980]   And so we might find ourselves in a place
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:36.660]   where a yes in here becomes a no out there.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.580]   So just think real quick.
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.880]   Is there anything that you've already agreed with God on?
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.380]   At some point in the past,
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:46.060]   like God has called you to do something
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.700]   and you said yes to it in a moment like this,
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:53.220]   and yet the yes in here became a no out there.
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:55.860]   If there's anything that comes to mind,
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:58.140]   look, there is grace.
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.700]   You don't need to feel shame.
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:03.740]   But my encouragement to you is to just take seriously
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.220]   the words of verse four.
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.260]   Let me read it again.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:11.080]   "When you vow a vow to God, do not delay paying it,
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.380]   for he has no pleasure in fools.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.640]   Pay what you vow."
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.740]   Pay what you vow.
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:20.320]   Do what you say that you are going to do.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.620]   You know what unbelievers need to see in Christians?
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:29.280]   Like, I think that a lot of people who don't know Jesus,
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.480]   they don't wanna know Jesus
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:35.240]   because they look at the Christians and they see hypocrisy.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.220]   But do you wanna know what the unbelievers at your work
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:41.740]   or at your gym or at your apartment complex need to see?
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:42.860]   You know what they need to see?
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:46.940]   They need to see Jesus changing your life.
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.580]   I'm not talking about you just going out
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.420]   and trying to muscle up and be better.
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.520]   No, I'm talking about you every day
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:57.300]   just surrendering to Jesus, you leaving here tonight,
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:00.840]   just saying yes to Jesus and whatever he's calling you to.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:04.080]   That begins to change you.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:08.280]   When I say that true worship impacts tomorrow,
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.040]   I'm talking about getting up tomorrow
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.600]   and your yes tonight still being a yes in the morning.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:20.260]   Unbelievers need to see that Jesus actually is
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.520]   in the business of changing lives.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.880]   Because when unbelievers look into your life
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.920]   and they see more peace, more joy, more selflessness,
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:35.360]   more freedom than an invitation to the porch
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.720]   or an invitation to churches,
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.900]   it's no longer an invitation to come hear music
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.680]   and a message.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.940]   It's an invitation to meet Jesus
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:48.100]   who is in the business of changing lives.
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:53.720]   The final key to stepping away from hypocrisy
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.800]   and taking a step towards authenticity
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.920]   in a moment like this is this true worship
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.800]   is how we say thank you to Jesus.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.440]   It's how we say thank you to Jesus.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.920]   I just want to be very clear.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:08.160]   This message, I told you all from the beginning,
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.580]   this is going to be a unique message.
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:10.960]   It's going to feel different
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.480]   because we're talking about what we're doing right now.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.960]   My goal of this message isn't to introduce
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.360]   more restrictions into our worship.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.740]   It's to introduce more reverence,
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:27.760]   more gratitude, and more authenticity.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.680]   So remember why Jesus went to the cross.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.520]   This is the key.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.880]   Remember why Jesus Christ went to the cross.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.640]   And if you're not a Christian, here it is.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.400]   This is the point of Christianity.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.520]   The point of Christianity is not bad people
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:46.320]   trying to become good people or moral people
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.080]   trying to be morally superior to other people.
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.540]   That's not Christianity.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.760]   This is Christianity, 1 Peter 3:18.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:58.760]   For Christ, Jesus Christ, also suffered once for sins,
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:03.200]   the righteous for the unrighteous.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.520]   The righteous, that's Jesus Christ, perfect Son of God.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:10.400]   The unrighteous, that's us, imperfect human beings.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.240]   Why?
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.280]   Why did he do that?
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.160]   Why did Jesus go to the cross and suffer,
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.920]   which means he went to the cross
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.040]   and he was punished for all of our sins,
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.600]   all of our imperfection.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:26.480]   He did it that he might bring us to God.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.800]   That's it.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.280]   That's the reality.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.720]   No one is born right with God.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:37.720]   And nobody gets right with God by just trying harder.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:41.240]   Because imperfect people cannot get themselves right
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.920]   with a perfect God.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.040]   And the great news is that a perfect God left heaven
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.840]   and came to earth in the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.200]   He lived the perfect life that we couldn't.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.240]   And he died a perfect death.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.840]   And the reason I say it was a perfect death
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.560]   is because it was perfectly suitable
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:03.300]   as a replacement for all of the imperfection
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.720]   of anyone who had put their trust in Jesus.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.840]   And then he walked out of a tomb,
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.960]   conquering our sin and death,
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.000]   making a way when there was no way.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.840]   This is the beauty of Christianity.
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.320]   This is the beauty of Jesus.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.280]   He's made a way for imperfect people
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.120]   to come into a place like this
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.800]   and to stretch out our hands
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.280]   and to worship God and to hear from God.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:25.960]   For God, the God of the universe,
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.260]   to delight in us as his children.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:33.640]   And the beauty of Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:38.280]   is even in the moments, even on the Tuesday nights,
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.720]   where we just go through the motions mindlessly
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.700]   and we're kind of offering the sacrifice of fools.
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.000]   You know what the beauty of the cross is?
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.240]   Is that every moment is a new moment with Jesus.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.840]   Every moment is a new moment with Jesus.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.880]   God is quick to forgive,
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.200]   and he's quick to welcome you
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:59.360]   into deeper intimacy and fellowship with him.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.500]   So, hey, here's the reality.
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:06.960]   If you've been tuned out for the last hour and 20 minutes,
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.300]   God still wants to speak to you tonight.
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:14.720]   This is a moment now for you to meet with God.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.640]   Solomon finishes the passage by simply saying this.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.720]   He just ties it up.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.920]   Verse seven, he says,
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.960]   "For when dreams increase and words grow many,
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:29.280]   there's vanity, but God is the one you must fear."
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.380]   All he's saying is, look,
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.440]   when you just go through the motions mindlessly,
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.680]   babbling on, just moving your mouth,
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.800]   going through the motions,
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.620]   you know what that is?
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:38.780]   That's vanity.
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.720]   You know what that means?
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.460]   It means that is frustratingly empty.
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.280]   It's like trying to hug a cloud.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.060]   You're looking for satisfaction.
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:48.480]   You're looking for fulfillment,
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.960]   and you're not gonna find it.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.820]   What's the key?
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.640]   True worship.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.400]   Fear God.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.800]   It means come into this place.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:03.680]   Believe God is here, and he wants to meet with you.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.960]   So here's how we're gonna end tonight.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.120]   It's gonna look a lot like last week.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.080]   I'm gonna pray in just a minute,
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.200]   and then when I say amen, here's what you need to know.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.400]   You are free to go, but you're also free to stay.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.400]   Like you're free to go, and if you're ready to go,
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.000]   when I say amen, you totally can.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.840]   I would just ask that you leave quietly
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.920]   so that anyone who wants to stay in worship
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.840]   for a little bit can worship.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:28.720]   And if you wanna stay, the band's gonna come,
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.200]   band's gonna lead us, and you have the freedom
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.080]   to raise your hands or to get on your knees,
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.240]   to sit in your seat and pray,
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.580]   to just do business with the Lord.
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.680]   Like if you need a quieter place to worship,
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.640]   you can go up those stairs and out those doors
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.280]   into the prayer chapel, and you can just sit
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.460]   in a quieter place, meet with God.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:50.600]   If you need to come down front and pray with someone,
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.520]   like we'll have people down front.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.540]   If you need to go out to the welcome desk and say,
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:57.340]   "Look, I don't have a Bible."
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:00.480]   Like if God speaks to us through the word, I want that.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.360]   We'd love to give you one for free tonight.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.520]   If you don't have a Bible, let us give you one.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:06.960]   Maybe tonight you're gonna walk out there
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.560]   and you're gonna finally sign up for lunch
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.600]   because lunch is an opportunity
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.360]   not just to meet people, but it's an extended weekend
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:18.140]   of just meeting with God together.
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:22.480]   Maybe you just need help taking your next step with Jesus.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:25.400]   Like you need to talk one-on-one with someone
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.280]   who can just help you take your next step
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.480]   with the church or with the community group.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:32.520]   You can go out that door and up those stairs
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.840]   to the loft, which will be our next steps.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.760]   Like we just wanna help.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:42.760]   This is a place for us to meet with God.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.080]   And so I'll pray.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:47.320]   And then the time is yours to worship.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.520]   Lord Jesus,
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:56.200]   you're worthy of everything, Lord.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.400]   I thank you that thousands of young adults
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.400]   have gone to all the effort they have to get into this room.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:05.320]   But since they're here, Lord,
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.180]   I pray that every one of them would meet with you.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:12.560]   That God, in your kindness, you'd just speak to their hearts
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.840]   that they would sense that you're meeting with them.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.640]   If there's anyone here who doesn't feel worthy of that,
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.800]   I pray that they would experience your grace
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.080]   and your forgiveness tonight,
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:26.080]   that they would know that no one is too far gone
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.820]   and there is no one that can outrun your love
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.600]   for them tonight.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.320]   So come and have your way in our lives.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.680]   We love you.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.160]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.920]   (wind whooshing)
