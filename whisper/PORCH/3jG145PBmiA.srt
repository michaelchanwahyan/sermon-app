00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,940
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:32,040
 All right, let's do this.

4
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,920
 How we doing tonight, y'all?

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,520
 Woo!

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,360
 Hey, tonight-- thank you so much.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,280
 New shoes, thank you.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,440
 Hey, tonight we are wrapping up, like Carson said,

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,320
 the Matchmaker series.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,200
 And we have talked about amazing things-- singleness, dating,

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,560
 marriage, all of those things.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,680
 And they brought me up tonight to finish

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,040
 strong talking about heartbreaking breakups.

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,560
 Yeah!

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,040
 Something we all can resonate with in some way or the other,

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,080
 sadly, I bet.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,000
 And they were like, hey, going around the room,

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,600
 who can communicate about heartbreak?

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,760
 And I was just like, I volunteer as tribute.

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,720
 I'll do it.

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,760
 So they got me up here.

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,160
 And before I get to that, I want to bring you

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,960
 all into a moment in college where I was in my room alone.

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,480
 And I want to go ahead and confess.

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,360
 This was a sin.

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,760
 And thank God for the Lord's redemption in my life.

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,920
 But I was doing something I think we all have done,

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,280
 more than we like to admit.

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,720
 I was downloading music illegally off of YouTube.

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,240
 Yeah, LimeWire, or whatever it's called, that was me.

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,040
 And I was that guy.

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,800
 And iTunes was full of the sketchy, weird names

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,560
 of each of the songs, like the underscores and stuff.

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,400
 And I was downloading music.

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,640
 And as I'm copying the link, pacing it

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,320
 into this sketchy website, like interlink here,

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,160
 begin download, this notification popped up.

38
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,800
 And it was like, warning, warning,

39
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,240
 your Mac is under attack.

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,280
 It is a virus.

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,040
 You need to call Apple support immediately.

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,080
 And they gave me a number.

43
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,160
 I was like, seems legit.

44
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,120
 So I called the number.

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,400
 And I was like, I don't want a virus on this computer.

46
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,160
 So I called them and I'm like, hey.

47
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,520
 And they're like, hey, how's it going?

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,440
 How can we help you today?

49
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,520
 And I'm like, my Mac has a virus.

50
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,400
 I need you to get rid of it, whatever.

51
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,880
 And they're like, yeah, we do this all the time.

52
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,320
 What you need to do is click here, click there,

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,880
 bada bing, bada boom, type in your password.

54
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,840
 We're gonna have access to your Mac.

55
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,560
 We will start to take control.

56
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,920
 And then we will, some of you already know where this is going.

57
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,120
 We will start to take control.

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,280
 And then before you know it, virus gone, no problem.

59
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,120
 And so I'm like, sweet.

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,760
 So I give them access to everything.

61
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,600
 It's really cool.

62
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,240
 I'm like, wow, you guys can really, where are you?

63
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,120
 Like, watching them, you know, click on things.

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,400
 I hear like really fast typing.

65
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,840
 And I'm like, man, you guys are like really fast typers.

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,800
 And I'm like, hey, I'm gonna call my friend by the way

67
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
 and just tell him what's going on

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,200
 in case I need to do anything else on my end.

69
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,600
 He was like super smart IT tech guy.

70
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,520
 I call him.

71
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,880
 Oh, and by the way, before I left the phone call,

72
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,800
 the guy didn't say anything.

73
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,640
 I'm like, are you good?

74
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,460
 You good?

75
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,300
 I just hear typing.

76
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,840
 And so I call this guy and I'm like, hey,

77
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
 here's the problem, don't worry.

78
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,160
 My Mac has a virus and there's this guy, he's fixing it.

79
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,680
 He was like, JD, bring me your computer right now.

80
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,520
 And I was like, why?

81
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,120
 And he was like, Macs can't have viruses.

82
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,440
 So you're being hacked.

83
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,840
 You are literally being hacked right now.

84
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,560
 Someone is trying to get everything on your Mac,

85
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,080
 steal all your money, bring me your computer.

86
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,160
 And I was like, what?

87
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,000
 And so I hang up with him.

88
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,380
 Guy is still typing on the phone.

89
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,520
 I'm like, you imposter, I'm gonna find you.

90
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,320
 Wherever you are, I'm gonna find you.

91
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,160
 I hang up, I take the Mac, I seatbelt it in.

92
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,000
 I'm driving to my friend's house.

93
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,280
 And the Mac is, I'm just screaming.

94
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,120
 I don't know if he can hear me.

95
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,440
 I'm like, wherever you are, Italy, China,

96
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,200
 FBI is coming, buddy.

97
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,440
 And I'm just watching him go to work on my Mac.

98
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,440
 And I bring it in, I'm like, fix it, fix it, fix it.

99
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,920
 He takes the Mac, he just starts doing the same thing.

100
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,740
 That kind of hacker.

101
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,920
 I'm like, how do you know how to do this?

102
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,320
 Coding is coming up.

103
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,300
 And he looks at me and he says, JD, we can fix this,

104
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,200
 but only under one condition, you might lose everything.

105
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,680
 And I'm like, everything?

106
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,880
 I was a video editor.

107
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,800
 I was, school, you know, college is on that Mac.

108
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,880
 All these different things.

109
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,720
 I'm like, everything?

110
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,600
 He's like, everything.

111
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,680
 And I was like, send it.

112
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,360
 And so he goes and he goes and he pushes a button

113
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,520
 and it's like wiping everything, resetting MacBook.

114
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,360
 And I was just watching it, you know,

115
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,480
 it was like one of those, like in the arms of,

116
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,520
 and it was like slow motion going away.

117
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,040
 And it was so sad.

118
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,120
 And I remember just being so mad at that person.

119
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,920
 But the reality was is I thought that that relationship,

120
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,880
 hacker guy, was there to help me.

121
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,000
 Reality was, is he was actually hurting me.

122
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,760
 He was there to take from me.

123
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,920
 And I start there because just like I needed to go

124
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,960
 to the professional of all things Mac,

125
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,920
 my friend that's all high tech,

126
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,720
 and he had to tell me, hey, that relationship is harming you.

127
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,920
 You need to get out immediately.

128
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,480
 I think some of us need to go to the expert

129
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,740
 on all things love, all things dating, all things marriage,

130
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,320
 and go, hey, you're in a relationship

131
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,920
 that you think is helping you and it is harming you.

132
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,140
 It is taking from you.

133
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,320
 And tonight, as we wrap up the dating series,

134
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,840
 I hope that every person here flourishes in love.

135
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,160
 Like I truly hope you all find love.

136
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,240
 It would be amazing.

137
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,200
 But the reality is, is sometimes and most times,

138
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,200
 a lot of us don't get to love without experiencing hurt

139
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,080
 and experiencing heartbreak.

140
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,160
 And so I think it's important that we talk about it

141
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,200
 from a biblical perspective.

142
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,600
 And so I wanna go to God, the person who knows all,

143
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,760
 knows the condition of the heart because he created it,

144
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,480
 and see what he has to say about love

145
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,860
 and make sure that we are all aware,

146
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,080
 hey, you might have to get out of this relationship.

147
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,920
 You might need to break up because a breakup now,

148
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,880
 heartbreak now in the temporary

149
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,880
 is better than a broken marriage in the future.

150
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,280
 And so if you don't deal with this now,

151
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,200
 you could end up not just breaking yourself,

152
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,560
 but breaking a lot of people in the days to come.

153
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,560
 And so I wanna go into heartbreak and breaking up tonight

154
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,280
 by talking about two things, really simple,

155
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,340
 when to break up and how to heal from your heartbreak,

156
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,500
 when to break up and how to heal from your heartbreak.

157
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,420
 Because it's better that we go ahead.

158
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,100
 And like I said, put in the work now to go,

159
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,940
 do I need to get out?

160
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,140
 Like, do I need to flee?

161
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,100
 And here's the reality.

162
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,780
 When I had to delete everything off my Mac,

163
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,540
 when I lost all the things that I had worked for

164
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,520
 and all the time I put into all the things on that Mac,

165
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,220
 it was better for me to lose things willingly,

166
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,980
 to make the choice to lose it all

167
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,080
 than to unknowingly have it taken off from me

168
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,920
 and have everything taken from me

169
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,280
 like that guy was planning on doing.

170
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,100
 And so tonight, let's see if we didn't make that choice

171
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,320
 to experience what might be heartbreak now

172
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,320
 to experiencing something more whole in the future.

173
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,080
 So when to break up?

174
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,380
 Now that I've got this super heavy

175
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,100
 and we're all like, yay, breakups.

176
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,400
 When to break up?

177
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,980
 I wanna talk about just four easy reasons

178
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,240
 to identify when to break up.

179
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,080
 The first one, when you are dating their potential.

180
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,620
 Reason number one, when you are dating their potential.

181
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,940
 Here's what that looks like.

182
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,640
 When it comes to like, if you're dating someone

183
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,900
 and trying to figure out if they're legit or not spiritually,

184
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,020
 like if they're truly a man or a woman of God,

185
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,760
 you start to do this thing where you compromise

186
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,400
 because maybe they're like a 10 on hotness,

187
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,100
 but like a four on spiritualness.

188
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,620
 And you're like, it seems legit.

189
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,460
 And like, we go to church every now and then.

190
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,900
 He loves the Christmas service.

191
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,740
 I mean, he just loves it.

192
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,380
 He loves Christmas carols.

193
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,260
 Maybe guys, you're like, yeah,

194
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,220
 like we totally like hooked up three times this week.

195
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,340
 But like on Sunday, she texted me a verse

196
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,140
 and was like, thankful God gave me you.

197
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,140
 And it's like, there is like a hint of God

198
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,060
 in this relationship.

199
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,460
 So like, it's legit.

200
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,420
 We are spiritual, we're good.

201
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,220
 And you start to go, even though I know deep down

202
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,380
 this isn't good, I have hopes.

203
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,620
 I see glimpses of hope that this person will one day be good

204
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,020
 and you start to date their potential.

205
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,380
 But I want to make you aware

206
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,980
 that if you are dating someone's potential

207
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,000
 over their present reality,

208
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,460
 you are going to end up hurting yourself.

209
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:02,340
 You want their present reality to be all about the Lord.

210
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,580
 You want someone who's not hopefully one day

211
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,340
 going to stop verbally abusing you.

212
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,180
 Hopefully one day, potentially out there,

213
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,860
 they'll start wanting to go to church

214
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,660
 and not just wanting to watch football all day.

215
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,020
 You'll hope that one day they're not just like,

216
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,140
 they're wanting to read the Bible

217
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,700
 and like go through Bible studies together

218
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,100
 and serve the church together.

219
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,260
 You're not just going one day, one day,

220
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,420
 you know, when we get kids,

221
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,900
 I'm sure when he's a father,

222
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,980
 he'll take this stuff more seriously.

223
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,540
 Or man, when she starts, when we get a house,

224
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,200
 when I buy a house and put a ring on it,

225
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,380
 that's when we'll start going to church

226
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,620
 and doing the God thing.

227
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,740
 But for now, like, let's have fun.

228
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,040
 And there's this idea of like a potential future

229
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,820
 that like is laced with spiritual things.

230
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,180
 And you have to ask yourself and be honest with yourself.

231
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,100
 Hey, if this person isn't pursuing God now,

232
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,900
 if this person doesn't want as an individual

233
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,300
 to lead me now towards Christ,

234
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,380
 what do I think is gonna change?

235
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,660
 Like, what's it gonna take for this person to change?

236
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,460
 And if they didn't get it right as a single person

237
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,420
 before they met me,

238
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,880
 if they'd never had a desire for God without me,

239
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,060
 apart from me, what do I think is gonna happen?

240
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,180
 And you're living in this fantasy potential world

241
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,340
 and not realizing the present reality that you're in.

242
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,740
 Second Corinthians 6.14 puts it like this.

243
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,580
 Don't team up or date or be in a relationship

244
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,540
 with those who are unbelievers.

245
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,480
 How can righteousness be a partner with wickedness?

246
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,300
 How can light live with darkness?

247
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,060
 What harmony can there be between Christ and the devil?

248
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,980
 How can a believer be a partner with an unbeliever?

249
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,400
 And what union can there be between God's temple and idols?

250
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,580
 For we are the temple of the living God.

251
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,460
 I think a lot of times we don't see ourselves

252
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,220
 as the temple of the living God.

253
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,420
 We don't understand what it means

254
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,800
 to be God's son or daughter.

255
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,600
 So we're okay with dating trash.

256
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,180
 And I think a lot of times who you date

257
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,180
 says a lot about who you think you are.

258
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,000
 Because if you saw yourself as the temple of the living God,

259
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,480
 meaning that if I am walking in relationship with God,

260
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,960
 that literally the Holy Spirit, the Bible says,

261
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,580
 comes inside of me and I am like the host.

262
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,000
 I am the house that God dwells in.

263
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,660
 I'm not dating trash.

264
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,640
 I'm not taking a spray paint and spray painting myself.

265
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,000
 No, I am representing Christ.

266
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,080
 And I'm wanting someone who's going to also next to me,

267
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,240
 beside me, represent Christ.

268
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,640
 You can't say, "Hey, I'm light and be around darkness."

269
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,560
 It doesn't work.

270
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,640
 And so the first thing you have to ask yourself is,

271
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,200
 am I dating their potential?

272
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,840
 Because if you are, you're gonna end up making excuses.

273
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,020
 You're gonna end up lowering your standards.

274
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,580
 And before you know it, you're gonna be pulled further

275
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,520
 and further away from being about God yourself.

276
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,640
 It's like the idea of missionary dating.

277
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,420
 You're supposed to be on mission together,

278
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,700
 not on mission for them.

279
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,560
 Okay?

280
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,840
 And we've used this illustration a lot.

281
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,680
 Emma, where are you at?

282
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,640
 Can you come up here?

283
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,720
 Or down here, I guess.

284
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,540
 You've probably seen this,

285
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,480
 but a lot of times what this looks like is like,

286
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,040
 let's say I'm someone who's really trying to follow God.

287
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,680
 Like I've been going through my devotional.

288
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,840
 I've been reading my Bible.

289
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,240
 I've been coming to church every Sunday.

290
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,640
 I'm even going through membership class.

291
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,320
 I never thought I'd be going through membership class.

292
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,640
 And then I meet this person at the bar

293
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,120
 and I'm kind of in this in-between world.

294
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,320
 And they're like, "Yeah."

295
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,160
 You're like, "Hey, are you spiritual?

296
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,040
 Are you religious?"

297
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,120
 He's like, "Yeah, I've gone to church.

298
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,940
 I was raised Catholic.

299
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,240
 I was this, I was that."

300
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,760
 And he starts sending you like, "Okay, yeah, yeah.

301
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,520
 God box, check."

302
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,840
 And you start to date and you start to notice patterns

303
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,680
 and you start to realize, okay,

304
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,200
 this person doesn't really read their Bible.

305
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,680
 This person doesn't really like to go to church.

306
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,040
 I feel like I'm kind of like pulling them to church.

307
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,840
 And you start to say, "Hey, come up here.

308
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,640
 Come on, come on.

309
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,460
 Hey, what are you doing?

310
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,600
 Come with me to church.

311
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,520
 Emma, come on.

312
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,880
 Don't you want to go to church?"

313
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,360
 And you're sitting here

314
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,640
 and you're trying to pull this person

315
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,920
 up to where you are spiritually.

316
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,480
 Like, "Hey, it's amazing up here.

317
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,360
 You should come try it.

318
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,520
 Come on, come on."

319
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,400
 And the reality is, is it's actually easier.

320
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,600
 The law of gravity would say that it's easier

321
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,600
 for Emma to pull me down here

322
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,800
 than for me to pull her up there.

323
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,640
 Thank you, Emma.

324
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,720
 Let's give it up for Emma really quick.

325
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,000
 (congregation applauding)

326
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,480
 And I think so many of us,

327
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,040
 that's our reality is we're sitting here mentally,

328
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,560
 spiritually in this struggle of going,

329
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,280
 "I just, I'm seeing their potential.

330
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,240
 I know they can do it.

331
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,360
 If you would just come on, buddy,

332
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,100
 get there so I can stop feeling so guilty about dating you."

333
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,120
 And they're pulling you down

334
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,000
 and they're pulling you lower

335
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,440
 because they're asking something of you.

336
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,680
 And you're operating as something

337
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,960
 that you were never supposed to be.

338
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,520
 Your dating life, your love life

339
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,120
 was never supposed to look like you pulling someone.

340
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,820
 It's supposed to look like you two pushing each other.

341
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,300
 Not pulling, not forcing, pushing, respecting, honoring,

342
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,620
 and growing together towards Christ.

343
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,240
 So quit dating potential.

344
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,440
 If they don't want Christ now, break up with them.

345
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,320
 It's that simple.

346
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,600
 Second reason to break up.

347
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,580
 When you're dating is only physical.

348
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,340
 When you're dating is all about the physical.

349
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,500
 This is what this looks like.

350
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,540
 When you're dating,

351
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,320
 like let's say you, you know, just to say it plainly,

352
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,680
 people call it makeup sex.

353
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,320
 You're in conflict, you're yelling at each other,

354
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,700
 you're going through all these problems,

355
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,920
 and then somehow you always end up having sex.

356
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,180
 It's just mind blowing.

357
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,000
 Like you end up doing the most intimate thing

358
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,980
 after all of the hurting.

359
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,780
 And you think, okay, well, the sex is good.

360
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,020
 Okay, the physical is good.

361
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,420
 Or, hey, we're making out all the time.

362
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,260
 Every time we're hanging out,

363
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,580
 we like kind of get to the kissing.

364
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,160
 I'm kind of like not acknowledging,

365
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,300
 just like you weren't acknowledging

366
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,440
 like the spiritual component,

367
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,860
 you're kind of not acknowledging that,

368
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,620
 hey, we don't really seem to talk about real things,

369
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,180
 deep things, we don't really seem to like go there.

370
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,600
 I can't have like a deep conversation with this person,

371
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,100
 but man, we can get physical.

372
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,780
 Man, he seems to really change

373
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,720
 when I talk about having sex.

374
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,020
 Or, hey, when I'm kind of showing a little bit of freaky,

375
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,820
 that's when he kind of gets into me.

376
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,020
 And girls, I want to first say to you, get out.

377
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,020
 Like if he doesn't respect you enough

378
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,120
 to not just see you as a physical being

379
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,460
 that just brings him pleasure,

380
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,740
 get out.

381
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,220
 And guys, if you are just seeing a woman

382
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,040
 or if she honestly in 2020,

383
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,020
 if she's just seeing you as some physical object

384
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,380
 to make her feel more affirmed

385
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,620
 and fill a void in her life, get out, bro.

386
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,460
 Because relationships, God never designed for such intimacy.

387
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,500
 Sex is a gift from God.

388
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,300
 And if you are using that gift and distorting it

389
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,020
 and breaking it and bringing it into the dating world,

390
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,580
 you are fogging up all of your perception.

391
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,280
 You're fogging up all of the reality,

392
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,340
 and sex is like this thing that like,

393
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,820
 it like puts drunk goggles on you

394
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,060
 and you can't see clearly.

395
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,540
 And all of a sudden your relationship

396
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,180
 becomes all about the what, rather than the who.

397
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,980
 And you start to not be able to see clearly

398
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,680
 that the who I'm dating is not a good person.

399
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,900
 But hey, the what, the physical is pretty good.

400
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,840
 So I'll stick around.

401
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,420
 It kind of like, it's like a bandaid.

402
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,540
 It fixes the problem.

403
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,460
 We're good, I'm good.

404
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,300
 It's just fun, noncommittal.

405
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,100
 And that's just not God's design for dating.

406
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,880
 If your dating revolves all around physical, breakup.

407
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:30,660
 If you think that, hey, if we just live together,

408
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,760
 play house, shack up, hey, we can have sex,

409
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,260
 we're never gonna get married.

410
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,620
 Like we're gonna get married, okay?

411
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,760
 So it's like, why wait?

412
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,760
 You know, it's okay, sex isn't that bad.

413
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,900
 And you're doing all the things

414
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,260
 that God intended for marriage.

415
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,940
 Here's what that communicates about your reality.

416
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,700
 You want all the benefits of marriage,

417
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,460
 but you're not willing to put in the commitment.

418
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,360
 You're not willing to put in the work.

419
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,680
 And so if everything always seems to go back

420
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,900
 to the physical, or when the physical is the only time

421
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,280
 that you feel alive and something going on

422
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,180
 between you and your significant other, get out, breakup.

423
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,900
 The next reason to break up,

424
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,000
 when you're dating pushes you away from people.

425
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,140
 Proverbs 18, one says,

426
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,980
 "Whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire.

427
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,340
 "He breaks out against all sound judgment."

428
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,400
 Guys, your relationship is meant to happen

429
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,380
 within the context of other relationships.

430
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,780
 You should allow people to constantly be speaking

431
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,640
 into your relationship, knowing what's going on.

432
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,340
 If you are dating in private,

433
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,260
 if your person is asking you to isolate yourself,

434
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,740
 if people are coming around you saying,

435
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,480
 "Hey, it seems like ever since you started dating so-and-so,

436
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,940
 "we don't see you very much."

437
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,780
 You need to see that as a red flag.

438
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,140
 If you're someone that maybe your best friends

439
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,100
 are coming up to you and they're saying,

440
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,420
 "Hey bro, she seems kind of like crazy.

441
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,860
 "You might wanna like get out of that."

442
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,360
 You're like, "No man, like trust me,

443
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,540
 "it's just like this thing we got, it's like special bro."

444
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:05,740
 Or girls, if your sisters or girls or whatever

445
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,420
 are coming over to you,

446
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,820
 I don't know if they should call each other.

447
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,020
 (congregation laughing)

448
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,520
 If they're coming over to you and they're like,

449
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,320
 "Hey, he seems like not good for you.

450
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,580
 "Like, hey, I'm actually being serious, I'm begging you.

451
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,400
 "You might wanna get out of that.

452
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,340
 "Something seems off.

453
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,000
 "Why doesn't he wanna be around?

454
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,420
 "Or why do you always seem more sad?

455
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,820
 "Why are you always crying?

456
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,780
 "Why have you changed?

457
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,260
 "Why are you getting more gloomy?"

458
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,240
 If they're saying that to you,

459
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,080
 you need to wake up and listen.

460
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,020
 I think so many people like all before a significant other,

461
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,860
 we were so down to listen to everyone's advice.

462
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,740
 "Tell me what I should do, tell me what I should do."

463
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,180
 But how come sometimes when we're in a relationship

464
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,900
 with a bad person, a jerk,

465
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,860
 any kind of person that's not good for us,

466
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,460
 we suddenly think we're experts?

467
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,460
 Like, what is that?

468
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,340
 And so if you're dating in private,

469
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,660
 if you're dating and it's pushed you away from your people

470
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,340
 and you're not dating in community,

471
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,840
 I would encourage you to either fix it or break up.

472
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,020
 And the last reason you should break up

473
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,180
 is when you're dating has no purpose.

474
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,940
 We say this a lot here,

475
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,100
 you're dating should have a destination.

476
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,260
 It should have an end goal and that end goal

477
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,180
 by God's design biblically is marriage.

478
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,940
 And if you are dating someone

479
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,740
 who is making you constantly wonder, question,

480
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,740
 insecure, uneasy of where you're at, like, what is this?

481
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,380
 Where is this heading?

482
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,500
 Does he actually like me?

483
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,340
 Am I actually the only one?

484
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,200
 How many girls does he Snapchatting?

485
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,500
 How many guys, how many ex-boyfriends

486
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,860
 is she reaching out to when she gets a little too drunk?

487
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,380
 Like, where are we at?

488
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,620
 Where is this?

489
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,440
 And if you are with someone

490
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,520
 that you can't even talk about the future,

491
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,880
 get out because you're not ready.

492
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,420
 And if you aren't ready for commitment

493
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:59,740
 or if they aren't ready for commitment, you need to get out.

494
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,940
 You need to break up

495
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,380
 because dating needs to have a destination.

496
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,580
 Dating is a exploration that leads to a confirmation.

497
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,820
 That confirmation could be yes or no.

498
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,460
 This is good, this is bad.

499
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,500
 We're gonna get married, we're not gonna get married.

500
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,540
 It can be a confirmation, but even if it's yes or bad,

501
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,460
 it was dating, it was right.

502
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,380
 But if it's just dating with a question mark,

503
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,480
 that's not right.

504
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,040
 Your dating needs purpose.

505
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,220
 Men, be clear with your women.

506
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,100
 Say, girl, it is you and only you.

507
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,380
 Let them know, hey, I'm just about you.

508
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,580
 I'll delete Snapchat, I'll get off Instagram.

509
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,440
 Dating apps, obviously, I hope they're gone.

510
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,940
 Girls, if he still has dating apps on his phone

511
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,820
 and he's dating you, break up, okay?

512
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,260
 Let me just say that.

513
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,760
 Hey, you can take my text messages.

514
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,820
 You have an open invitation into my life

515
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,220
 because I have nothing to hide.

516
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,300
 I am about you.

517
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,540
 I am pursuing the Lord.

518
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,740
 I'm committed to the Lord.

519
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,660
 I'm about you.

520
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,660
 Women, the same for you.

521
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,900
 Hey, I am so in love with Jesus.

522
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,820
 I'm so about you.

523
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,780
 Therefore, I'm willing to lay down my passions.

524
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,740
 I'm willing to set physical boundaries.

525
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,060
 I'm willing to do whatever it takes

526
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,920
 to make sure that we are walking in God's design

527
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,860
 and what's best for us because I am so about you

528
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,420
 and I'm so about what God wants for us.

529
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,180
 That is love.

530
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,340
 That is how you feel alive with someone.

531
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,460
 When you choose to be on mission together

532
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,300
 towards the destination that God designed.

533
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,620
 And if you're not with someone who wants to do that,

534
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,380
 bounce, okay?

535
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,220
 Okay.

536
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,660
 Okay.

537
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,620
 A scripture for that.

538
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,020
 Ephesians 5 31, I don't want my tangent.

539
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,180
 Says, "As the scriptures say,

540
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,980
 a man leaves his father and mother

541
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,820
 and is joined to his wife

542
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,380
 and the two are united into one."

543
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,540
 That's just God's design.

544
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,660
 Like leave mom and dad, leave the old life,

545
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,620
 leave the talking to other women and other men

546
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,300
 and all the flakiness and all the uneasiness

547
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,260
 and all the lack of clarity and pursue her,

548
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,340
 commit to her, commit to him,

549
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,660
 sacrifice and pursue God's design, which is marriage.

550
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,380
 And fellas, as I close the section of when to break up,

551
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,460
 you might be some of the reasons

552
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,260
 that she needs to break up with you

553
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,120
 and don't make her do it.

554
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,220
 If right now you are listening to what I'm saying

555
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,700
 and you're going, I'm that,

556
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,820
 I'm the toxic person for her,

557
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,380
 I'm the bad influence for her,

558
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,340
 I am not the spiritual leader for her,

559
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,480
 I am not being a man of God,

560
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,540
 you need to go end it with her.

561
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,740
 And yeah, it might hurt her for now,

562
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,780
 but it will help her later.

563
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,560
 And you need to go get it right

564
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,260
 because your most important relationship

565
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,380
 is your relationship with God.

566
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,880
 And if you are not God's man,

567
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,620
 then you don't need to be her man.

568
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,740
 Okay.

569
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,580
 No, no, no.

570
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,620
 Keep going.

571
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,620
 Ladies,

572
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,060
 men, it's coming.

573
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:12,660
 If you are pointing fingers right now and going,

574
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,500
 you know what?

575
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,340
 He's not that, he's not that, he's not that, he's not that.

576
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,620
 Why are you with him?

577
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,180
 And if I had to look at your track record,

578
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,220
 I bet you've been with more guys like him before.

579
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,020
 And so you need to ask yourself,

580
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,820
 guys, I know we're kidding, having fun,

581
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,620
 but this is serious.

582
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,200
 You need to ask yourself why?

583
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,340
 I talked about this like with the last talk,

584
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,300
 wasting my time right now,

585
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:38,300
 but I'm saying you need to make the move of I'm done.

586
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,880
 I'm pursuing the right relationship first and foremost,

587
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,860
 and then that will impact the future relationships I'm in.

588
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,100
 And so if you keep going back

589
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,880
 to hurtful, harmful relationships,

590
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,580
 break up and get the right relationship right.

591
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,080
 I'm begging you.

592
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,260
 And if you do, you'll be okay.

593
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,720
 It might hurt for a season, both of you, it'll be okay.

594
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,840
 You're gonna get through it.

595
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,420
 And I'm gonna tell you how in the next section.

596
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,500
 After you identified when you break up,

597
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,280
 let's say, hey, JD, okay, I'll break up, I'll end this,

598
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,460
 but I know this is gonna result in loneliness

599
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,420
 and hurts and heartache.

600
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,980
 What do I do with that?

601
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,080
 Which I'm glad you asked.

602
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,220
 The next section is how to heal from heartbreak

603
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,060
 or how to heal from your breakup.

604
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,940
 I'm gonna give it to you in two steps.

605
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,300
 It's so amazing.

606
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,380
 The Lord, I think He intentionally gave us the answer

607
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,060
 to how we help heal our heart

608
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,000
 is the same way that we heal anything

609
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,860
 on our body that's broken.

610
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,060
 One time I, in college, made a stupid mistake

611
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,460
 the first day of summer to go off a zip line unattached,

612
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,260
 like not attached to it, just like my body.

613
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,300
 And I like held onto the things.

614
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,760
 I was like, Geronimo, I went off the zip line,

615
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,440
 fell 22 feet, broke my ankle.

616
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,160
 Yeah, it's a long story, I'll tell you another time.

617
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,620
 So my ankle, like my foot is literally,

618
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,520
 my toes are supposed to be going up like this.

619
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,740
 They were going like this, okay?

620
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,060
 They were like over here.

621
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:08,980
 And I was like, oh, okay.

622
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,660
 So the first thing I did was pass out.

623
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,320
 And then once I came back,

624
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,100
 I wasn't like, take me to Burger King.

625
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,180
 I don't know why I said Burger King,

626
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,180
 but take me to Burger King.

627
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,820
 No, I was like, take me to the hospital.

628
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,260
 Take me to the doctor.

629
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,620
 Take me to someone who knows what to do with this.

630
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,620
 And they take me to the doctor because why?

631
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,740
 The doctor knows how to fix my broken leg.

632
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,520
 In the same way, you need to go to the expertise,

633
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,300
 the expert, the creator of your heart

634
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,660
 when your heart is broken.

635
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,520
 You need to stop going to everything else.

636
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,960
 You need to stop going to alcohol, addiction, pornography,

637
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,880
 Netflix, ice cream, bickering about your ex.

638
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,360
 You need to stop going to all these different things

639
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,880
 to look for healing when there's only one person

640
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,800
 who knows how to actually bring healing to your heart.

641
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,900
 It's the great physician.

642
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,280
 His name is God.

643
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,720
 And you need to stop going to all these different places

644
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,200
 thinking, okay, this is the doctor of my life.

645
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,040
 This will heal me.

646
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,820
 No, they'll just put Band-Aids on it.

647
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,880
 They won't heal you.

648
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,920
 And you need to go to church.

649
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,360
 You need to get into community.

650
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,920
 You need to start opening up your Bible and reading it.

651
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,600
 And you need to start developing a relationship

652
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,600
 with the only person who truly knows how to heal your heart.

653
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,880
 And then after you go to him,

654
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,080
 after you go to the great physician, to God,

655
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,480
 and you bring him your broken heart,

656
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,960
 just like I brought to the doctor my broken leg,

657
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,480
 that doctor healed it to me and said, what happened?

658
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,320
 Tell me everything.

659
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,140
 Where is it hurting?

660
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,980
 What are you feeling?

661
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,480
 He started touching my leg and my foot and going,

662
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,300
 what's going on?

663
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,140
 He's analyzing.

664
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,240
 He's wanting all the details

665
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,560
 because the more I can give him,

666
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,320
 the more he better knows how to help me.

667
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,920
 In the same way, God,

668
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,600
 he doesn't want you just to come and be like,

669
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,440
 hey, are you good?

670
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,800
 And you're like, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

671
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,640
 Like, it's good.

672
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,700
 Like, no worries here.

673
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,540
 That's what we do.

674
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,680
 Why does our first instinct,

675
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,960
 we're sitting there crying, hurting.

676
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,760
 Our friends are walking up, they're like, hey, are you good?

677
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,080
 Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

678
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,520
 I'm fine, I'm really fine.

679
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,880
 Yeah, are you sure?

680
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,400
 Yeah, I'm good.

681
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,880
 Or you become just the worst person to work with at work.

682
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,560
 You're invalidating, you're quick-tempered,

683
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,320
 you're rude, you shut off your friends

684
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,780
 because you're not fine.

685
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,680
 And people are checking in on you

686
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,920
 and they're saying, hey, you good?

687
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,040
 I know that breakup was hard.

688
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,000
 Are you good?

689
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,440
 And you're like, I'm fine, I'm fine.

690
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,200
 Look at me, back to me, back to my self-care,

691
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,400
 back to my self-help.

692
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,520
 I don't need to go to the helper.

693
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,640
 I don't need to go to the word.

694
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,600
 I can go to the world.

695
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,000
 I can do all these different things and I can fix myself.

696
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,840
 I'm fine and you're not fine.

697
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,480
 And you know it and I know it.

698
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,740
 You are not fine.

699
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,040
 If the best thing you can do tonight

700
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,440
 is look at yourself in the mirror and say out loud,

701
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,280
 I'm not okay.

702
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,840
 Some of you haven't done that.

703
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,400
 You've suppressed and you've suppressed and you've suppressed

704
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,280
 and you have not dealt with your pain.

705
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,880
 You have not dealt with your heartbreak.

706
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,480
 And just like if I chose to not go to the doctor that day

707
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,880
 and tell him how I'm broken,

708
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,400
 if you don't choose to go to God

709
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,680
 and tell him the broken pieces of your heart,

710
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,440
 you're gonna walk around with a limp and hurting

711
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,920
 and making everyone around you concerned, awkward,

712
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,680
 all these different things for the rest of your life.

713
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,540
 And you're gonna end up hurting yourself even more.

714
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:20,220
 And so it is time to go to the doctor

715
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,380
 with your broken heart.

716
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,160
 Go to the Lord and tell him how you're feeling.

717
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,360
 It hurts here.

718
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,660
 When he did this, it hurts.

719
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,440
 When she cheated, it hurts.

720
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,980
 I wanna address something really quick.

721
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,620
 I have talked to more guys this year

722
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,340
 who have been cheated on by women than I can count.

723
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,780
 And I started thinking about it.

724
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,700
 I'm like, you know, one of the things I hear a lot for women

725
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,820
 is all guys are jerks.

726
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,720
 And then I was thinking about it more and I was like,

727
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,560
 you know what?

728
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,920
 I don't actually think all guys are jerks.

729
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,960
 I think they're hurt.

730
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,860
 I think at some point in that guy's life, he was broken.

731
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,460
 Guys hate rejection.

732
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,980
 That's why they're afraid to ask a lot of girls out.

733
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,900
 And he was broken and he was hurt.

734
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,660
 And instead of going to the Lord

735
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,420
 and going to God's people and talking about it,

736
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,800
 he choose to just, I'm fine.

737
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,700
 And now he hurts a lot of women.

738
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,100
 Now he's scared to commit and you call him a jerk.

739
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,300
 I just go to him and say, bro, you're just hurt.

740
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,240
 Who hurts you?

741
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,460
 Was it your dad?

742
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,620
 Your mom?

743
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,720
 Who cheated on you?

744
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,860
 Who broke up with you?

745
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,020
 Let's go to God.

746
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,020
 Let's deal with it.

747
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,880
 And ladies, I know that you also too, like,

748
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,300
 well, hey, me too, I've been cheated on.

749
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,500
 I've been hurt.

750
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,580
 Same to you.

751
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:53,180
 Quit going to Tinder, dating apps, Instagram,

752
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,600
 self-help books.

753
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,180
 Go to God.

754
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,140
 Go to his word.

755
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,700
 Go to fellow Christ followers and say,

756
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,080
 I am broken and here's where it hurts.

757
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,220
 If you wanna give God the broken pieces of your heart,

758
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,380
 you just can't give him some.

759
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,120
 You can't just go to church and call it fixed.

760
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,660
 You have to give him all of your heart.

761
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,400
 It's the idea of surrender.

762
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,180
 God, I give you all my heart,

763
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,860
 the good, the bad, the ugly, the brokenness.

764
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:28,460
 And once you do that, step two will begin to take place.

765
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,620
 He'll begin to tell you the process towards healing.

766
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,420
 And your call is to trust the process.

767
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,580
 Matthew 11, 28 through 30 says,

768
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,860
 then Jesus said, come to me,

769
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,540
 all of you who are weary and carrying heavy burdens,

770
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,620
 and I will give you rest.

771
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,740
 Take my yoke upon you.

772
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,580
 Let me teach you because I am humble and gentle at heart

773
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,220
 and you will find rest for your souls

774
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,660
 for my yoke is easy to bear

775
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,560
 and the burden I give you is light.

776
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,980
 Another verse that comforts me in hard times

777
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,900
 when I feel broken.

778
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,060
 Psalm 34, 18, the Lord is close to the brokenhearted.

779
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,780
 He rescues those whose spirits are crushed.

780
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,740
 Psalm 55, 22 says, give your burdens to the Lord

781
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,980
 and he will take care of you.

782
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,180
 He will not permit the godly to slip and fall.

783
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:21,300
 Guys, God is near to the brokenhearted.

784
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,380
 He's not afraid of your feelings.

785
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,060
 He's not afraid of your hurt.

786
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,700
 He's not afraid of your past sex life or your addiction.

787
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,620
 He wants it all because doctors love to see patients healed.

788
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:39,220
 When you bring your troubles and your sickness

789
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,020
 and your brokenness to God, he is like, yes,

790
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,420
 you are using me for my design.

791
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,540
 And now I am giving to you

792
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,420
 what I was designed to give to you.

793
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:56,020
 And there's no better way to deal with heartbreak

794
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,580
 than to come to the creator of your heart.

795
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,300
 Psalm 147, three says, he, being God,

796
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,020
 heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.

797
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,780
 I think for me, when I hear that word bind,

798
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,260
 I think of something that's withholding, restricting,

799
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,180
 holding me back.

800
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,100
 And right now you could think,

801
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,220
 God wants me to break up with her

802
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,660
 because he wants me to be lonely.

803
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,680
 Or he doesn't have, well, you know,

804
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,900
 what's gonna happen after that?

805
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,620
 And you can think that God is out to get you

806
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,780
 and bring harm to you and hurt your life.

807
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,380
 And that word binding actually

808
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,440
 is like the illustration of a cast

809
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,020
 because that's what the doctor did to me.

810
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,540
 After he reset my bone in surgery,

811
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,440
 he then wrapped it in a cast.

812
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,900
 And the purpose of a cast to heal the bone that is broken

813
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,900
 is to do two things, reset and restore.

814
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:46,940
 In the same way, God's purpose in your breakup,

815
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,820
 his healing to your breakup is to reset you

816
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,960
 and to restore you.

817
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,600
 The problem is, is you would rather rebound than reset.

818
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,780
 You would rather go and chase after anything

819
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,940
 that will give you attention.

820
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,700
 You'd rather go hook up with any guy or any girl

821
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,740
 that will hook up with you.

822
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,920
 You'd rather run to the bars.

823
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,160
 You'd rather run to every other scene

824
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,460
 than actually coming to God.

825
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,520
 You would rather rebound than reset.

826
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,420
 That thing that makes me actually have to address this hurt.

827
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,780
 And I don't wanna start over, frankly.

828
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,220
 I had something good there.

829
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,380
 I don't wanna end this.

830
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,180
 But I'm telling you, if it is time to break up,

831
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,020
 your breakup, just like that cast,

832
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,020
 its purpose is to stabilize and make me,

833
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,520
 force me to rest the use of my leg.

834
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,420
 So breakups are meant to put you on a break

835
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,700
 and to put your heart on a break.

836
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,440
 Your heart was not designed to fall in love,

837
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,260
 to date and then break up and then date and then break up,

838
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,620
 then date and break up.

839
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,700
 No, God is using that breakup

840
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,260
 and he brings healing to that breakup

841
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,860
 when you let your heart have a break.

842
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,580
 And when you let your heart have a break,

843
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,020
 he is gonna do those two things.

844
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,500
 He's gonna reset you, reset your focus,

845
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,700
 reset your attention, reset your heart,

846
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,220
 reset your ability to love, reset your trust,

847
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,300
 reset your peace.

848
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,540
 He's gonna reset all of these things

849
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,860
 and then he's gonna restore the broken pieces.

850
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,940
 As he is resetting you, he will be restoring you.

851
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:18,420
 And so you need to stop turning to all of these things

852
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,740
 to experience healing and running to all these things.

853
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,740
 You need to go and let God put a cast around your heart

854
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,340
 that is his love, his word, his people, his truth,

855
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,940
 and you need to be still and let restoration happen.

856
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:39,920
 Learn how to love again, how to trust again,

857
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,880
 how to hope again.

858
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,740
 There is hope on the other end of surrender.

859
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,780
 When you surrender the good and the bad,

860
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,740
 the broken pieces of your heart and your love to God,

861
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,740
 there is hope and that hope all lies within Jesus.

862
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:03,100
 And guys, I want y'all to know,

863
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,800
 like as I close up here, like firsthand, I have been there.

864
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,860
 Heck, I was there last year.

865
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:15,120
 Two-year relationship,

866
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,940
 thought it was going like towards the destination of marriage

867
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,000
 and God said, nope.

868
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,620
 And I moved to Dallas all alone,

869
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,740
 didn't know anyone, starting a new life.

870
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,260
 And last summer I sat in heartbreak,

871
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,940
 just like, God, what are you doing?

872
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,040
 Like, where are you?

873
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,200
 And guys, breaking up,

874
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,820
 you're not just losing like a relationship,

875
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,160
 you are mourning a loss of a person.

876
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,700
 It's not easy.

877
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,500
 I'm not sitting here like, so go do this

878
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,980
 and you know, best of luck.

879
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,340
 No, you will grieve, you will mourn.

880
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,740
 You will start to like look at your phone,

881
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,300
 wondering like, when will the next text come?

882
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,260
 Oh wait, it's not coming.

883
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,740
 I've experienced death.

884
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:02,340
 I've experienced people close to me dying.

885
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,720
 And when I experienced heartbreak, it was very similar.

886
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,780
 I remember sitting there like, where are they?

887
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,880
 And then naturally you want to share something with them.

888
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,340
 You want to text them something.

889
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,540
 At night, you're sitting there like wanting to call them.

890
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,400
 And your driving songs come on,

891
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,260
 all these different things are reminding you

892
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,420
 and you have to literally learn how to grieve

893
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,060
 and move on from that person that you lost.

894
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,740
 But I'm telling you, when you surrender that to God,

895
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,020
 there is hope.

896
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,380
 He is enough.

897
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,020
 He will sustain you.

898
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:37,020
 And this light temporary moment of hurt will lead to hope.

899
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,280
 And when I am hurting and I'm losing perspective,

900
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,140
 I go to this scripture.

901
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,480
 Second Corinthians four, 16 through 18.

902
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,000
 It says, that is why we never give up.

903
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,900
 Though our bodies are dying,

904
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,220
 our spirits are being renewed every day.

905
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,140
 For our present troubles are small and won't last very long.

906
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,620
 Yet they produce for us.

907
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,220
 This is what our troubles, our heartbreak,

908
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,660
 here's what it produces in us.

909
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,860
 It produces for us a glory that vastly outweighs them

910
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,260
 and will last forever.

911
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,980
 So we don't look at the troubles or the heartbreak.

912
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,220
 We can see now rather we fix our gaze on things

913
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,260
 that cannot be seen.

914
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,300
 For the things that we see now will soon be gone,

915
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,940
 but the things we cannot see will last forever.

916
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,820
 Here's what that means.

917
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,580
 I get to not just look at my circumstances

918
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,980
 and look at my heartbreak and look at my breakup

919
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,680
 and look at all of the hurt and the loss

920
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,780
 and the things I'm experiencing.

921
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,820
 Some of you right now are like,

922
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,140
 it would be nice to have some heartbreak.

923
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,240
 It'd be nice to be broken up with.

924
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,540
 I'm that desperate right now.

925
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,220
 My singleness, I'm sitting here going,

926
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,380
 buddy, I haven't even been broken up with ever in my life.

927
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,340
 And your heartbreak is going, why does no one want me?

928
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,220
 Why does no one choose me?

929
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,580
 That's where your heartbreak's coming from.

930
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,380
 Some of you, your heartbreak's coming from parents,

931
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,220
 divorce, the way your dad treated you,

932
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:57,460
 the way your mom treated you, and it broke your heart.

933
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,380
 Some of you have lost deep friendships to death

934
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:05,380
 or addictions or arguments, heartbreak.

935
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,500
 Some of you have been cheated on, abused.

936
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,140
 I don't know what your story of heartbreak is tonight.

937
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,340
 I don't know what your breakup has led to break you,

938
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,500
 but I know that there is hope

939
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,380
 on the other end of your surrender

940
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,940
 and the other end of your trust,

941
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,940
 and that hope, his name is Jesus.

942
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,740
 And for some of you tonight, you're going,

943
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,820
 what do you mean my hope is in Jesus?

944
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,360
 And it's because you've been so distracted

945
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,480
 by all these relationships

946
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,140
 that have caused nothing but hurt and pain,

947
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,220
 and you've missed out on the greatest relationship

948
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,620
 that has ever been known on this planet.

949
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,100
 It is when God sent his son down to earth

950
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,820
 to have a relationship with us.

951
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,820
 He walked in human flesh,

952
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,580
 and he lived a perfect life that none of us could live,

953
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,740
 which made him the perfect sacrifice to hang on a tree,

954
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,940
 a cross, and on that cross, a reminder for you,

955
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,640
 listen, if you're hurting, listen.

956
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,780
 On that cross, he saw your heartbreak.

957
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,660
 He saw the abuse.

958
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,660
 He saw your parents' divorce.

959
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,180
 He saw the cheating and the backstabbing

960
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,860
 and the gossip and the betrayal.

961
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,780
 He saw you laying in your room alone,

962
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,940
 crying in your loneliness and in your singleness,

963
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,580
 and he took it on the cross.

964
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:23,180
 And he took that, not so you could lose hope.

965
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,780
 He was broken, so in your brokenness,

966
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:32,440
 you could come and be made whole, be made new.

967
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,500
 And so tonight you have a choice.

968
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,480
 You can choose further pain.

969
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,460
 You can go back to your addiction.

970
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,700
 You can go back to your alcohol, to your drugs,

971
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,860
 to your pornography, to your bar hopping,

972
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,240
 to your hooking up, to your Tinder.

973
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,780
 You can go back to it and you can choose death,

974
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:52,100
 but I'm begging you tonight to choose life, to choose hope.

975
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,780
 He was broken.

976
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,940
 Again, he was broken, murdered,

977
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,460
 buried in a tomb.

978
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,280
 And he rose again, conquering death,

979
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,720
 conquering your heartbreak.

980
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,560
 So that you don't have to go to the world

981
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,400
 with your brokenness.

982
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
 You can come to him.

983
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:19,480
 And so tonight I ask you, as we respond in song,

984
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,520
 take some time and ask yourself,

985
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,600
 do I need to get out of this relationship

986
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,360
 and focus on the right relationship?

987
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,680
 Do I need to break up with blank?

988
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,960
 And then if you do, or if you've been broken up with,

989
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,580
 or if you're experiencing heartbreak right now

990
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:39,420
 in any way, shape or form, trust, surrender,

991
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,380
 bring the broken pieces to God

992
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,940
 and let him reset you and restore you.

993
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,660
 Let's pray.

994
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:54,700
 Father, thank you.

995
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,380
 Thank you for sending your son to be broken.

996
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,300
 Your word says that he was pierced for our transgressions.

997
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,360
 He was crushed for our sins.

998
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,540
 The punishment that brought us peace was on him

999
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,580
 and by his wounds, by his brokenness,

1000
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:16,660
 we can come with our brokenness and be healed.

1001
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,660
 Freedom can come tonight.

1002
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:25,440
 Hurt can turn into hope tonight.

1003
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,800
 Not by our own power, not by some process

1004
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,820
 or some system or by some ritual.

1005
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,700
 No, it can come tonight by simply believing

1006
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:39,700
 that your death was enough to cover all of the hurt.

1007
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:46,940
 So for those tonight who need to reset their life on you,

1008
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:51,420
 I pray tonight that they would.

1009
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,660
 In this moment right here,

1010
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,300
 I pray that you would restore the broken pieces.

1011
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,800
 In your name that I pray, amen.

1012
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,380
 (gentle music)
