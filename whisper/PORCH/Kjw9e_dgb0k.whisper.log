[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   [Music]
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.600]   All right, let's go, Porsche.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.500]   Let's do this.
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.100]   Y'all ready?
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.200]   Let's go!
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.000]   We are here to have a good time and we just want to go ahead and
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   start off by, like we always do, welcoming our Porsche Live
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.700]   locations.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.500]   I'm gonna let each of these guys welcome a Porsche Live location
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.800]   and make sure we show them some love in the room after each one.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.500]   So David.
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.700]   Welcome, Houston, Texas.
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.100]   Let's go Astros!
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.700]   Porsche Live Houston, welcome.
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.800]   All of you self-righteous people about them being cheaters, like
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.500]   you've never done anything wrong in your life.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.200]   Wow, I was going to not be as excited as that.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.200]   You don't have to be, be you.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.900]   Okay, Austin, we love you.
[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.800]   We're really proud of you.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.400]   Porsche Live Austin!
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.000]   Let's go Phoenix and Boise!
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.800]   Let's go Potatoes!
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.600]   Yeah, Phoenix and Boise.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.500]   And as always, our friends in the room, we're so glad you're here.
[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.100]   And like I said earlier, we are wrapping up the We're All Freaking
[00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.100]   Out series on mental health, anxiety, stress, worry, all the
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.600]   things.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.100]   And so we did this at Awaken just like this, pretty much, and it
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.400]   was, I mean, everyone loved it.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.100]   So, you know, we're diving in.
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.700]   You better keep making them happy.
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.200]   I loved it.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.200]   I'm like, let's do it again.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.700]   At least you guys loved it.
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.500]   Yeah, they're all like, who?
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.300]   What? Awaken?
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.300]   And so, okay.
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.900]   Well, first off, I know that you have all lived in Dallas at one
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.600]   point, the only one who doesn't, JP, you're down in Waco, Texas
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.500]   now, serving at Harris Creek.
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.500]   And, but you have lived in Dallas, obviously.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.200]   What is one restaurant?
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.700]   If y'all only got to eat at one more restaurant in Dallas, Texas,
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.800]   what would it be?
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.400]   Fuzzies.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.700]   I've got mine.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.400]   You said fuzzies down here.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.800]   You ready?
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.600]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.100]   What is it?
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.800]   Yeah, no, if I could only choose one, I would choose Macero, Mico,
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.600]   Matitos, and Velvet Taco.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.400]   Okay, got it.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.900]   Got it.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.700]   Mexican food.
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.900]   Math has never been his thing.
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.300]   Yeah.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.400]   Okay, I never get tired of Jose's.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.300]   Have y'all ever been there?
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.200]   The patio on a fall day.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.300]   Zach introduced me to it.
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.100]   I know, we introduce everyone to it.
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.100]   If you go out to eat with us, we'll probably take you to Jose's.
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.200]   We are Mexican lovers.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   I would say Mico Sina.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.800]   Wow.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.200]   Yeah, Mico Sina.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.600]   Okay.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.700]   And then let's go a little more on the spiritual side, and then
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.400]   we'll dive into the questions on mental health.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.500]   What is, I'll ask this, what book of the Bible are you reading
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.200]   right now, and give us kind of like, what are you learning in
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.400]   it?
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.900]   Are you reading the Bible?
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.600]   No, I actually stopped.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.200]   Do you read the Bible?
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   I actually stopped.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.100]   He's in the Quran.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.300]   It's great, man.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.900]   It's got some really--
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.300]   Running to Joseph Smith, he loves them.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.800]   There's some powerful nuggets in there for sure.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.500]   Today, this morning, I read through Mark chapter 4, and
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.500]   actually I'll share this here in a second, but we was camping
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.600]   out in Mark chapter 4.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.900]   And what did you learn?
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.800]   Oh, you'll share it later?
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.300]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.500]   Okay, a foreshadowing of what's to come.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.200]   Jenny?
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   So I'm actually listening to Galatians this week on Dwell
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.100]   app, and I love listening to books that I know pretty well
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.000]   because you hear it, and I listen in accents that are really
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.400]   interesting, and they read it differently.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.600]   Oh.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.300]   What accent are you on right now?
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.600]   Well, it's Felix, if you know Dwell app, and he reads it like
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.600]   real African.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.200]   It's awesome.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.700]   And he just, I love him.
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.500]   He's real passionate.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.500]   And so he is reading it to me, and I heard in Galatians,
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.100]   his passion make very clear that we cannot go after any other
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.600]   gospel, that there is no other gospel that we can live out, and
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.800]   so let's be sure we're living the true gospel.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.500]   That's good.
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.200]   Yeah, so I'm reading the Psalms in the morning, but where I'm
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.000]   camping out is in Ecclesiastes.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.400]   We're going through that, and I think this past week has kind
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.000]   of stayed with me for a number of reasons, but it's just like
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.300]   learn from your pain before you leave it, Ecclesiastes chapter
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.600]   seven, and so that God, and that's so relevant to what I think
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.600]   where we're going tonight, which is just like God wants to teach
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.200]   us something in pain, and that pain is some of the greatest,
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.400]   pain is one of the greatest teachers under the sun, and so
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.200]   on this earth, it's something that he allows to happen so that
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.400]   we can grow and be sanctified.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.000]   That's good.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.400]   Well, I just want to kind of dive into this conversation, and
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.000]   I'm so glad, thank y'all for making time.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.300]   I know that traveling and all that is crazy, especially in the
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.200]   middle of the week, and I think that this is a conversation
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.600]   that the church needs to be having more because people are
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.500]   having it, and they're looking for a place to look for answers,
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.800]   and I hope that it's always the church.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.900]   I hope that the church can become more and more of a safe place
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.400]   for people to be honest with what they're feeling, experiencing,
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.800]   and to be met with love and truth, and so I hope that tonight
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.700]   is a really helpful resource in this conversation, and so just
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.300]   starting off, because anxiety, mental health, all of these
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.400]   things seem to be plaguing the world, and everyone kind of is
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.200]   talking about it, but it is kind of this like lofty idea that
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.900]   people don't really know how to articulate. Before we try to
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.200]   talk about anxiety itself, where do you, where do y'all feel
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.500]   like, and anyone can answer, we can go, each of you, where do
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.600]   y'all feel like it is stemming from? Like what are the leading
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.200]   causes today of anxiety, depression, stress, worry, all
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.800]   those things?
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.500]   Well, we live in a very disconnected world. We are facing
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.500]   more than ever epidemic of loneliness, of course social
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.600]   media, there's so many right answers, but I'm going to actually
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.100]   go to a way deeper place and say it's definitely strategic, that
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.900]   the enemy, I believe, has spiritual, I mean, you said
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.500]   push the envelope before we came out here.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.500]   Push it, push it.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.100]   Okay, let's go, let's go.
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.100]   So I think the enemy is very strategic. You see Jesus
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.700]   talk about the enemy, he calls him a liar, and a liar is a,
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.000]   especially if he's a good liar, then he's thinking very hard
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   about how he lies and how he does it. And so what you've got
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.900]   is you've got a demonic force, sorry if you're new here and
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.100]   overwhelmed by this, but there's a demonic force working against
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.000]   us. I think it's an important thing to know as a Christian.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.600]   In fact, I'll start with Ephesians.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.800]   Sorry if you wanted to start lighter than that, but let's
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.500]   go. I figure this is a much...
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.200]   I'm riding into the demons.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.100]   Let's go to the demons.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.700]   All right, because if we don't start here, I think we're
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.400]   kind of missing, we're really talking about the things the
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.500]   demons are using, right?
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.100]   Like this is a plan.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.400]   You want to know when everybody in the world is feeling
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.800]   something at the same time, do you think that's an accident?
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.300]   Like the whole world is collectively anxious. And Scripture
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.500]   says, "Be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.200]   might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.100]   stand against the schemes of the devil." That he has schemes
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.900]   that are coming for you. "For we do not wrestle against
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.100]   flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities,
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.600]   against the cosmic forces over this present darkness." And
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.400]   I know that feels like an intense way to start, but if there
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.300]   are cosmic forces coming for us, I think we don't have another
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.600]   place we can start. Because there is cosmic forces coming
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.000]   for us, and there is a devil that is scheming how to take
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.700]   us out. And when you see, everyone you know, when I have
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.600]   elementary age kids that are shut down and cannot attend
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.000]   school because of anxiety, we have a massive problem. There
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.500]   is something happening in the world right now that is so
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.300]   thick and that is so strategic that I think we've got to
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.200]   realize that he's using all these different things. And it's
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   true. We are disconnected. We are on our screens. We are,
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.400]   you know, in a world where we know the problems of the entire
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.100]   planet, and that's all troubling. But ultimately, what the
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.700]   enemy wants is to shut down the church. And he's doing a
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.100]   really good job, I would say.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.500]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:19.000]   Yeah, just add quickly, if I can, that, and I've said this,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.400]   I mean, just this idea that selfishness is satanic. And so
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.200]   when we get so focused on ourselves, and we try to be God
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.800]   and we want glory, like we weren't made to be worshiped.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.500]   Like we have to offload that onto this dirty shelf of Jesus
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.300]   Christ. It will collapse us if we try to be at the center of
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.300]   our world. And so with the enemy, the enemy doesn't need
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.800]   you to worship him. Like there's probably not a lot of Satan
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   worshippers here tonight. Like you're probably not going to
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.700]   go home and like crack open the Ouija board and do the
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.600]   seance thing.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:58.200]   But if you will worship, I was like, okay, JD. But if he
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.100]   can get you just to focus on you, like the opposite of loving
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.900]   God is not loving Satan, it's loving self. And putting yourself
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.200]   or worshiping self rather. The opposite of worshiping God
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.400]   is worshiping self. That's why he said, just to piggyback
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.500]   on what she said, 2 Corinthians 10 5, we demolish all
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.100]   arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.600]   knowledge of God. And we take every thought captive and
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.600]   make it obedient to Jesus Christ. And right before that,
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.900]   it's talking about demonic strongholds. And so the enemy
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.000]   is going to try to distract you with you. When you start
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.900]   thinking about you a lot, that is the beginning of the spiral
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.100]   to despair.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.100]   It's good.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.900]   I don't think I'd add any. I think we are, to her point,
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.500]   or one of them mentioned, we're connected in all the ways
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.400]   that produce anxiety and disconnected in so many ways
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.100]   that prevent anxiety. And so we're not connected in terms
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.500]   of relationally to others that authentically walk alongside
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.200]   where we can talk about the ways that we're struggling.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.300]   The same problem is always causing anxiety, facing uncertainty
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.600]   and sitting in the place of God. And so having other people
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.100]   that are connected to us deeply, relationally, not on a
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.300]   screen, but connected in life is one of the ways that we
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.500]   prevent anxiety and being connected to all of the different
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:13.600]   alerts, problems, challenges, comparisons through digital
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.100]   connections, produce anxiety.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.300]   So we've got really in two different directions, something
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.500]   happening where we're doing things that produce it and
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.000]   not doing the things that prevent it.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.100]   I am.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.100]   You are such teachers because you pretty much just said
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.700]   three points and it was Satan's self in social media.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.400]   Oh, you're the teacher.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.900]   You're the teacher.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.700]   But okay, so JP, I'm going to ask you this because I think
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.400]   I've seen you talk about this on Instagram.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.000]   There's this quote that I've heard a lot around here and
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.600]   then in different spaces that say, it says, "Feelings are
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:50.300]   real, but not reliable." And I think that sometimes I struggle
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.200]   with that quote.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.000]   I'll be honest.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.500]   I get the heart of it, but feelings are God-given, emotions
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.300]   are God-given and they are such a gift.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.000]   And I think sometimes it can sound like feelings and emotions
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.700]   aren't safe at all.
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.100]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.600]   And I'm...yeah, she's like, "Let me finish." Okay.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:16.800]   So what I want to know is the Bible also says, "Do not listen
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.600]   to your heart."
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.900]   It's wicked.
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.600]   It's deceitful above all else who can know its ways.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.800]   And so how do we as young adults who are very much led by
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.700]   feelings, led by emotions, and we have been told that that
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.700]   could potentially cause the anxiety.
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.700]   How do we embrace the God-given gift of feelings and emotions,
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.900]   but also not let them be our God?
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.300]   Yeah.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:40.500]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.100]   So I first heard that quote from Todd Wagner and then I heard
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:49.100]   it over time improved to say, "Feelings are real, but not
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.100]   always reliable." Because sometimes they're very reliable
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.100]   when you touch the hot stove and it says, "That's hot.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.900]   That feels hot."
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.200]   You know, "Wow, it hurts." And that's a reliable feeling.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.100]   One time just south of here, so in Preston Hollow, I was
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.000]   driving around and I was in the midst of the roads where
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   they're not really a grid.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.700]   They're kind of windy and I got really turned around and I
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.300]   was just like, "I'm like a mile from here, but I'm lost and
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.900]   I'm trying to get back to Watermark." And I live here right
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.900]   at the time and I've lived here for 20 years and I can't
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.800]   find my way out of Preston Hollow.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.500]   And everything in me says, "I feel like Watermark is that
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.900]   way." And so I just start driving and eventually as I'm
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.000]   driving, I'm looking for Watermark and I'm looking for this
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.600]   medical tower over here.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.200]   I eventually see taller buildings, which are downtown.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.800]   And I'm like, "How did I get downtown?" And so, yeah, I
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.800]   know y'all are pointing at people.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.400]   You do that.
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:51.200]   And so what I did is I pulled out my GPS, you know,
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.000]   iMaps, Google Maps, right?
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.100]   And I put in the address and I just trusted it.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.600]   And so you need to know there's going to be times where
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.900]   you feel deeply like he's the one, she's the one, you should
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.500]   do this, you should work there, you should drink that, or
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.200]   you should take your life, you should cut yourself, you
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.200]   should end it all, you should despair, you should stay in
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.100]   bed. And in those moments, I would just encourage you to
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.300]   turn to your GPS.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:20.700]   And here it is.
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.200]   I'm going to give it to you.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:21.700]   Write it down.
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.500]   Ready?
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.100]   Gather your group.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.500]   That's believers.
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.900]   My friend, Ginny Allen, has an amazing book coming out in
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.800]   February called Find Your People.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.700]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.700]   Gather your group.
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.400]   Not one person, not your wise uncle, followers of Jesus in
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.100]   your life.
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.000]   Okay, so gather your group.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.400]   Persist in prayer.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.000]   And so begin to pray, "Lord, I don't know where I'm
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.500]   going. Would you speak through them?
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.100]   Would you show me?
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.700]   Would your Holy Spirit whisper to me, the voice behind me,
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.800]   whether to turn right or left?" And search the scriptures.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.300]   Is there a verse that, like, if I believe I should end it
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.800]   or I should stay in bed, but there's a verse that tells me
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.500]   something else, then I'm going to trust this over my feelings,
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:03.800]   right?
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.300]   I want to conform my feelings to what this says.
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.100]   So gather your group, persist in prayer, search the scriptures.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.300]   That's your GPS.
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.200]   When you don't know where to go, you turn there.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.400]   Say, "All right, I need to get my people in a room.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.300]   I need to ask God to speak through them before, during,
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.100]   and after. And I need to ask them, is there any scriptures
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.500]   that align with the counsel that you're giving me?" And so
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.200]   when that aligns, when your GPS aligns with how you feel,
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.100]   trust it. When it doesn't, don't. Your heart is wicked and
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.500]   deceitful and beyond cure, but the Holy Spirit gives you a
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.900]   new heart, a heart of flesh, not a heart of stone.
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.500]   But the problem is your degenerate heart under the sun
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.300]   in this world, detached from God, is kind of always there.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.600]   You can trust your new heart, but you can't trust your old
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.200]   heart. And that's why you have to have people in your life
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.300]   who will help you.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.400]   Good stuff.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.000]   Jenny?
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   I canoe.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.400]   And...
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.200]   Nice.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:56.800]   Or do that.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.300]   Just cook.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.700]   I mean, thank you for your honesty.
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.000]   Who gets lost on a canoe?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.300]   And she uses a GPS when she canoes.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:02.700]   I see.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.400]   I canoe.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.400]   And my husband would laugh because I'm not very good at
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.500]   it, but I do do it.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.700]   Like, I figure...
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.700]   Claire, where do you canoe?
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.000]   How can you be bad at canoeing?
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.700]   I'm going to tell you because it's very...
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.600]   Does anyone know that you can be bad at canoeing?
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.900]   I am a terrible canoeer.
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.600]   We're going to make a support group for all you bad canoeers
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.200]   out there.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.800]   So I am a bad canoeer, but I do canoe.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.600]   And it is a funny word, you know.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.100]   But what I would say about that is when I'm on the river and
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.000]   I'm canoeing, I own canoes.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.500]   I need to really brag that I really do canoe.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.400]   Like, that's something I do.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.300]   We got that part.
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.300]   She canoes.
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.600]   She has those shirts.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.500]   I canoe.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.200]   You know, I felt like I was saying something that wasn't
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:47.700]   true.
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.800]   Okay, like I own a canoe.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.200]   Okay.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:50.900]   She got the canoe.
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.400]   She has a canoe.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.300]   Okay.
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:58.300]   So when we canoe, we go down the river and I am horrible at
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.200]   it and they don't want me in the back and they don't want me
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.200]   in the front, which means you're in the middle because that's
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.500]   the people that don't paddle.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:13.600]   And so anyway, so when we're on the river, there are two
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.000]   options.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.900]   There's two shores and you don't want to hit them.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.100]   You want to go down the river.
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.200]   Okay, getting obvious.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.700]   So when you're doing this, what I would say is that every
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.500]   single one of us, what I learned in adoption therapy before
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.300]   we adopted was everybody has a window of tolerance and the
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.500]   window of tolerance is just like that river that you are
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.400]   going down the river.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.000]   You want to go down the river smoothly, safely, but the reality
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   is there's two shores. On one side of the river, you have
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.300]   the shore of coping, checking out, stuffing your feelings,
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.700]   pretending it's not happening.
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.800]   On the other side, you have chaos, anger, frustration, panic
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   attacks, losing your mind, you know, whatever.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.000]   So you've got these two sides of the river.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.400]   Well, all of us have a certain window of tolerance.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.200]   Nobody has an infinite window of tolerance.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.600]   There are always shores to the ability of things we can
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.600]   actually process and handle.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.300]   The more trauma, I'm just getting really technical here,
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.500]   but the more trauma you've been through, the smaller that
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.000]   river is, the smaller and tighter it is.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.600]   So if you've been through a lot, which let's be real, all
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.600]   of our windows of tolerance just shrunk.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.100]   We have collectively been through a lot.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.100]   So the river is really tight.
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.400]   And if you're not a good canoer, like I can't figure it
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.200]   out, I actually go the fastest and the best if I just
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.900]   don't paddle, like nobody paddles.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.200]   We just ride the river.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.000]   And I would say this actually very much applies because
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.600]   that is largely how we are supposed to go through this,
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.200]   is there is a sense of we really can't control our lives
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.500]   and we really can't control the world.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.200]   And so we are all freaking out.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:46.800]   We are.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.300]   And so when we're all freaking out, there's this sense of
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.300]   what do we do?
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.600]   And so we put our oar in and if you're like me, you hit a
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.300]   shore just because for some reason, every time my oar goes
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.100]   in, I go to the right or I go to the left and I'm trying
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.000]   to control it and I'm trying to make it work.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.700]   And the harder I paddle, the more I go to the right and
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.400]   left. Good for you that are good at canoeing, but I'm not.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.700]   And so when I do it, when I try to get involved overly
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.900]   in my life and try to control this thing, I'm going to
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.300]   the right or to the left.
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:18.700]   And what I would say is that there is a moment right now
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.600]   where we all have kind of put in our paddles and we're
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.800]   like, Lord, we need you.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.500]   Like you're just going to have to help us get down this
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.000]   river. And what's cool is if you go on a good river, there
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   is a current and it will carry you.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.600]   And I would say for all of us that are spinning right
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:40.200]   now, I mean, the reality is you are, and I want to say
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.000]   this as gently and kindly as I can.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.600]   I am so sorry.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.600]   I am so sorry and you are not alone.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.700]   You are not the only one that is feeling like it is
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.700]   absolute chaos.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.100]   Some of you have had a panic attack today.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.700]   Some of you have hit a shore in the last two hours.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.800]   Like you were outside paralyzed before you came in.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.600]   And I just want to say, humanly speaking, we all have
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.600]   a certain amount that we can handle.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.700]   And so do not be overly discouraged if you feel like,
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.100]   gosh, I keep hitting a shore.
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:18.500]   How you grow that window of tolerance, how you expand
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.900]   it and cause it to be larger, so I've learned, it's just
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.000]   impossible thing that you have to do is you have to
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.200]   be honest.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.900]   You have to say out loud how hard this is.
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.700]   And for girls, some of you are better at it.
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:37.700]   I'm not very good at it.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:38.700]   It's very hard for me.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.400]   For guys, you're probably not as comfortable doing it.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.300]   But what therapy has taught me is there is power in
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.300]   saying it out loud to people that nod.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.300]   I call it the universal head nod.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.100]   When you say something that everybody else feels and
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.200]   everybody kind of sits across from you and just does
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.800]   this, because all of a sudden what happens?
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.900]   You know, you're not alone.
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.400]   You know, you're not alone.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.200]   And I think, you know, I mean, I would just be curious
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.200]   like how many people in here, there's a lot of people
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.100]   in here, have struggled with anxiety in the last year.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:12.500]   And I want you to leave your hand up just for a minute.
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.800]   And I want you to feel the power of presence and the
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.500]   power of not being alone and how silly we are to not
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.000]   share that.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.900]   Okay, we can put it down.
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.100]   How silly we are to not share it because we are in
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:24.900]   such good company.
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.000]   And I think most of us do.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.500]   I don't know.
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.700]   Do you feel like people share it?
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.200]   Do you feel like people are honest about it?
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.400]   No.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:34.200]   It's not a long answer, but no, I don't think most
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.800]   people have relationships with people around them
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.300]   where they are willing to open up and share, which
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.200]   is why we hit on community so much here that one of
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.200]   the key vehicles for transformation for widening
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.600]   that tolerance zone is authentic relationships.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.900]   We just weren't made to live this life alone.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.900]   I also think that people don't think that people
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:53.600]   care enough.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.300]   Like they think, what do you care what I'm dealing
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.000]   with inside of here, which is sad, but I think that's
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:00.600]   a whole thing.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.800]   Can we ask the audience?
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.300]   Sure.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.400]   Why is it hard to share?
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.000]   I think it would be great to hear from you guys.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.300]   Pride.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:11.800]   Pride.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.300]   Shame.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:19.600]   It's vulnerable.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.500]   People leave.
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.200]   Feeling like a burden.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:31.600]   Feel different.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.900]   You know, it's funny.
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.200]   None of those have in common things that are of
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.100]   the Spirit of God.
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.500]   And I don't say that to shame anyone, but shame,
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:49.200]   pride, fear, none of those have in common the Spirit
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:49.700]   of God.
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.300]   You know, my wife is a counselor and studies even
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.900]   show one of the reasons therapy is even helpful for
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.500]   people is just talking about it does diminish those
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.500]   feelings of anxiety, kind of gets it out from this
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.300]   vague feeling of fear and worry and anxiety and it
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.000]   puts it out on the table.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.300]   And so sometimes one of the healthiest thing you
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.300]   can do is just try to articulate it because sometimes
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.000]   we get stuck because I don't even know what I'm
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   feeling and just try to put words around it and
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:17.800]   articulate it.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.500]   And when you do, especially with trusted other believers,
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.100]   you'll begin to experience more peace, some sense of
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.000]   deeper freedom.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.700]   Yeah.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.800]   Well, since we're talking about this specifically,
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.000]   where's the next question personally?
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.400]   I know that all three of you have talked about
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.600]   struggling with anxiety or depression, panic, worry,
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.700]   stress in some way and just let us in, maybe one or
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.400]   two of you, let us into whether it was a season,
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.300]   something current and how do you either fight it or
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.900]   how did you get out of that season?
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.200]   What does it look like for you personally?
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.900]   I know you just said bring people in but practically
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.600]   more practical.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.000]   Yeah, say it out loud.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.400]   I think is, you know, I went through this season where
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.300]   I was, I would have a panic attack even around speaking
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.600]   and this is my job.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.800]   And so it feels like, like my livelihood is going
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.500]   out the window and this thing that God called me
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.100]   to do.
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.800]   And when I talked to an expert, you know, who was an
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.500]   expert, he just said you should just tell them that,
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.300]   like you should just say that.
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.900]   And so I learned about something called cognitive
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.200]   behavioral therapy, which if you go to someone to
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.800]   treat anxiety, there's two roads.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.200]   There's medicine and there's therapy and medicine
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.900]   works really well for some people and therapy works
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.200]   really well for some people.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.400]   And so I was in the therapy camp that was very
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.800]   helpful to me and it was interesting what this
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.200]   therapist prescribed to me was, and he wasn't a
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.600]   Christian, which you know, that's just where I was
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.700]   that day, you know, the life raft was this guy who
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.600]   wasn't a Christian, but he knew that I very much
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:03.500]   was and, or I am, and he's still a Christian.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.500]   And it's good news.
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.100]   It's good news.
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.900]   And he was just like, hey, just you should meditate,
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.300]   you should dwell on a thought.
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.700]   You should focus deep into it.
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.000]   He's like, you know, you know what you do.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.400]   I think you call it prayer.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.600]   And I was like, that's so fascinating that what this
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.400]   guy, the latest greatest start of the state of the
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.900]   art treatment was really something David did 3000
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:26.900]   years ago.
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.900]   God prescribed 4000 years ago, right?
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.100]   I meditate on your law day and night.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.000]   It is like honey.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.600]   And just if you think about Paul in the New Testament
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.300]   in Philippians 4, he says, do not be anxious about
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.300]   anything, but in everything by prayer and petition
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.300]   with thanksgiving, present your request to God and
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.900]   the peace of God, which transcends all understanding
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.000]   will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.600]   Jesus.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.200]   And I've heard David teach this even recently.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.500]   He's not saying don't be anxious because that's
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.200]   not helpful.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.100]   He's saying don't be anxious without prayer.
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.800]   And if you think about what he's saying, saying
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.200]   do not be anxious about anything, but in everything
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.400]   by prayer, which is prayer and petition, which is
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.900]   prayer with thanksgiving, which is prayer.
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.900]   He says don't be anxious, but pray, pray, pray.
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.600]   And we think, oh man, like, yeah, you know, preacher
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.600]   man, you're supposed to say that like band-aid on
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.400]   my wound and it's like, but no, no, like deep
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.800]   contemplative prayer actually heals both because
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.900]   God responds to prayer, but also we were made for
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:25.500]   prayer.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.100]   And like we right now we don't have time for prayer.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.500]   This thing is the enemy of prayer.
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.100]   Like it hates prayer.
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.400]   Satan is using this to destroy your prayer life.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.400]   Like, like I don't know how many, like how many
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.900]   of you by show of hands, like prayed for more than
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.600]   30 minutes straight today.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.300]   Like you sat there for 30 minutes and you prayed,
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:47.700]   right?
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.700]   Way less hands.
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.900]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:56.200]   Like lots of us were anxious in the past year, but
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.600]   very few of us prayed for longer than 30 minutes.
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.100]   And again, I'm not saying this to shame you, but
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:01.800]   to help you.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.100]   I think there is a solution.
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.500]   Like nobody here is going to pray for 30 minutes
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.500]   straight and be a worse person.
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:13.000]   Like it's only going to be helpful.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.900]   And then he goes on in verse 8 and says, think about
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.800]   whatever is pure, whatever is right, whatever is
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.200]   true, whatever is noble, whatever is admirable or
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.200]   lovely, if anything is excellent or praiseworthy,
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.100]   think about these things.
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:32.100]   He's saying again, he is prescribing in the New
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.100]   Testament, cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.700]   It's the same thing that I paid $250 an hour to be
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.200]   prescribed to me.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.000]   And it's not a platitude or cliche and you may need
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.600]   medicine.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.800]   Like like some of your own medicine, you may need
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.200]   medicine.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.000]   That's awesome.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.600]   That can be a really helpful tool to get you to a
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.700]   place where you can then pray with a clear mind.
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:27:00.500]   But all of us should practice long-extended
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.900]   contemplative prayer.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:02.900]   That's good.
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.500]   So I'll share about what I'm going through right
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.100]   now, just because I think maybe it could encourage
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:11.400]   you.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.000]   So I came back from a little short sabbatical this
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.100]   summer and I'd done that because I had hit burnout
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.600]   last year in a way that scared me.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.900]   And so I took this break.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.300]   I came back and I had so much anxiety that it was
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.100]   physical again.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.900]   And I'd had that years ago, but I hadn't had it in
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.600]   a while and it hit me in a way that I was having
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:38.600]   a such a physical reaction that I knew I needed
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.100]   help.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:43.900]   And so I started going to group therapy, which I
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:44.900]   think is helpful.
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.200]   I know we're talking a lot about therapy, but you
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:46.400]   know what?
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.500]   We talk a lot about the Bible here and I think
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.000]   church is a good place to talk about what it looks
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.400]   like to apply the Bible.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.800]   And so when we're talking about these conversations,
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.700]   I want to be really clear.
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.900]   Therapy is not an answer.
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:27:59.800]   It is not a fix-all.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.900]   My husband always says it only works if it works.
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.900]   But what it does is it for me, it has helped me
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.300]   take what I believe into my life and into my living
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:12.200]   and into my soul where I am not as scared.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.100]   Because what I learned in group therapy this year
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:20.400]   was that largely my 12-year-old self is scared
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.000]   of things.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.500]   And I know this sounds crazy to some of you unless
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.700]   you've done therapy and you're like, "No, it's
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.600]   true. It's really happening." And I say that
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.700]   because I think it's important that we realize
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.500]   that we are a sum of our parts, that there's not
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.300]   some individual place in our lives where we can
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.700]   just decide in our thinking and read a verse and
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.800]   put it on our mind and all of a sudden we're healed
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.500]   and we should no longer be anxious.
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.900]   We live in such, under such shame and condemnation
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.700]   that we're anxious, that we can't ever actually
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.400]   get to the root of why we are anxious.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.600]   There's a voice in our head that's telling us,
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.100]   "I'm scared.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:52.400]   I'm scared.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.300]   I'm scared." And then there's another voice that's
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.100]   judging the voice that's telling us we're scared.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.700]   And that voice is the one that's actually wearing
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.200]   you out.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.700]   The other voice of saying, "I'm scared," prior to
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.200]   12, I used to say that.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.500]   I used to say, "I'm scared.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.400]   Mom, help." But at 12, I learned that there were
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.900]   certain things expected of me and I had to, you
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.900]   know, measure up and I needed to meet the
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.300]   expectations in the room and they were never
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.500]   going to be spoken, but I would need to know
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.000]   what they were and then I would need to meet
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.600]   them. And some of them were impossible to meet,
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.000]   but I would still need to meet them.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.600]   And so this voice started in me at 12 years old
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.000]   that was, "I'm scared and don't say it." In fact,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.800]   don't be scared and meet all these expectations.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.700]   And so what that does to someone over time is
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.500]   rather than just saying, "You know what?" And
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.200]   this is what I want to be sure we're really good
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.600]   at as believers, which a lot of us are.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.100]   We need to be honest about what's going on.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.100]   And the reason we need to be honest about what's
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.100]   going on is because confession is not just about
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:56.500]   sin. To confess means to be truthful, to tell
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.800]   the truth, to confess what is true. We have to
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.600]   say what is true or we're going to stay stuck
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.900]   for a long, long time. The freest people I know
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.300]   are the ones that admit that they're stuck and
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.200]   they need help. And you go to regen, oh my
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.100]   goodness, those stories, they get up there, they
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.800]   share what's going on in their life. And I want
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.000]   to be that way, but honestly, even just this
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.800]   year, I've had to practice being that way. So
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:23.300]   last night, we'll be real current, I'm in a
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.100]   small group with my friends and I'm learning
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.100]   like when you don't want to say something, say
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.400]   that thing. And so everybody's gone around in
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.900]   their small group and said the thing and it's
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.900]   my turn and I have something that is just
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.500]   boiling up inside of me. And I'm like, I need
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.000]   to go to bed. It's 1015. We need to be done. And
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.100]   then I knew like I'm supposed to say the thing
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.500]   I'm not supposed to say. And I cried pretty
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.200]   hard and I shared what I was stressed about and
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.300]   what I was feeling. And I got texts, my phone
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.000]   is probably blowing up right now, still from
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.900]   them because they began to fight for me and
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.500]   they began to say, hey, no, you're not going
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.400]   to go down like this. Let us tell you how we're
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.500]   going to support you and be around you and
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:06.000]   walk through this with you. There is power in
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.400]   saying it out loud. There are so many reasons
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.900]   to say it out loud because one, I got it off
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.000]   my chest like David talked about. Two, I had
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.600]   an army come around me and be praying for me
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.500]   and helping me in the last 24 hours. And three,
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.600]   I said what was true so that perhaps I could
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.300]   begin to deal with it. It's a beginning place.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.200]   It's not the end place. But I'm very worried
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.200]   about what I just heard of how many people
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.800]   aren't quick to say that they're struggling.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.700]   And what I want to be clear about too is we
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.700]   don't say it so we can stay there. We say it
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.000]   so that we can get free. It's not something
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.500]   that we need to find our identity in and
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.800]   forever be defined as I'm someone who has
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.200]   anxiety. We are all people that have anxiety.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.900]   We all are. And so what we also are are people
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.600]   that are filled with the spirit of God and
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.800]   more than conquerors and able to fight this
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.000]   together, never alone. I don't know anybody
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.300]   that's gotten very free alone.
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.300]   That's good.
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:06.900]   Yeah, I think on the note of the importance
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.300]   of having people in your life to challenge
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.800]   and courage come alongside. There was a story
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.600]   a friend of mine told me that was a fascinating
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.200]   engaging story. It was a time he went to
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.100]   Six Flags and they have this huge, I think
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.300]   they used to have it. I don't know if they
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:19.700]   have it anymore, where you could go up and
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.900]   see the city. It's like a huge elevator. You
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.300]   go up and you see the city. He said he went
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:27.800]   up with his group and it stopped at the top
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.900]   and it got stuck. And it was stuck for five
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.600]   hours. Oh, I'm very anxious listening. Yeah,
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.500]   and they're stuck in this glass box, hundreds
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.100]   of feet up in the air. And they tried to get
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.500]   it down. They tried to get it down. They've
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.200]   got workers kind of coming up all around
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.500]   them. And eventually, and there's kids. I
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.000]   mean, it's Six Flags. So it's like families,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.900]   kids, people all in this little box. He said
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.800]   the kids were like doing totally fine. It was
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.700]   the adults who were freaking out. And he said
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:58.000]   eventually they opened the ceiling and this
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.200]   rope ladder was thrown down. No. And each one
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.000]   of them had to climb up and walk down the
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.100]   catwalk all the way down hundreds and hundreds
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.600]   of feet in the air. And he said afterwards
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.000]   there were phobias that developed with other
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.900]   people. And we were talking about just that
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.100]   topic of fear and kind of these more acute
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.700]   focused fears and how do you fight them. And
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:23.400]   I was just asking him because it was DTS
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:27.100]   professor head of counseling. And I was
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.200]   saying so in that moment, how would you
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.700]   encourage somebody like just hold on to, hey,
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:31.900]   I'll never leave you, don't forsake you.
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.500]   He said, no, that's all cerebral. You can
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:38.200]   tell them that verse, but until they have
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.600]   they have an associated negative emotional
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.300]   attachment to heights now. And they have to
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.000]   replace that associated emotional attachment
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.400]   from a negative one and replace it with a
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.500]   positive one. And one of the ways that they
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.200]   do that is by having relationships, friends
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.200]   that encourage them and help them take those
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.800]   steps. So in other words, phobias from
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.900]   elevators developed as a result of that. And
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.400]   they had that people come alongside of them
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.000]   and not just say, hey, get on the elevator.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.500]   It's going to be fine. That works for some
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.900]   people. It doesn't work for everybody. But to
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.500]   have people that go, hey, we're going to take
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.200]   a step. Just going to step on the elevator.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.200]   We take a step, we're going to step back off
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.300]   the elevator. We'll just let it go. Then we're
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.600]   going to take another step and I'm going to
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.700]   be right here with you. We're going to go and
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.700]   we're going to not just allow you to sit in
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:20.000]   that phobia. I'm going to help you and come
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.200]   alongside. Now, what's that have to do with,
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.700]   you know, most of us don't have fears of
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.200]   phobias of elevators, but we do have trust
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.400]   issues from past relationships. We do have
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.900]   issues where we don't, we have traumatic
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.900]   experiences with a family member or a father
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.800]   or maybe your parents fell apart and having
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.300]   other people in your life that encourage,
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.800]   that come alongside, that tell you it's true,
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.600]   but they also are going to encourage you to
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.200]   take that next step. Hey, not every guy is
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.500]   like that. Not every marriage ends that way.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.100]   And I'm going to call you forward to be who
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.800]   God is calling you to be, to be who you
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.300]   ultimately want to be and to encourage you
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.800]   and spur you on and walk alongside and bear
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.100]   Galatians 6 says, one another's burdens
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:59.400]   together. So that's a long answer from all
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.500]   of us. That's good. It's good stuff. I think
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.400]   yeah, if we're going to clap, let's clap.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:04.800]   Let's clap.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.800]   Y'all, y'all all have talked a lot about
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.300]   the power of community and people. And if I
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.600]   had to bet there's someone here right now
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.000]   who's feeling super alone.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.700]   They have tried or they've been hurt and
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.600]   or they just can't seem to like keep friendships
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.000]   or make friends. And I think that a lot of
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.200]   people, they could have a lot of friends and
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.900]   still feel alone. So people that struggle
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.300]   immensely with loneliness, what would you say
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.500]   to them with what you're saying the answer
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.600]   is community, community, community. But they're
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.700]   like, no, I'm, you don't know my circumstance.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.800]   I'm super alone. I don't have community.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.000]   And you just wrote a book on it.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.900]   Yeah, I mean, I think you're not alone that
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.000]   you feel alone. I think the numbers are
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.700]   astounding with that as well. We've got prior
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.000]   to COVID three and five people said that they
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.500]   feel lonely. So we've got, you know, probably
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.400]   I would say four and a half after four and a
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.200]   half out of five that feel lonely post COVID.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.400]   And so I think you're not alone and feeling
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.200]   alone and what's comforting about that is
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:10.000]   that probably other people need you and need
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.100]   the same things. And so I think, you know, one
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.500]   of the best things I've ever heard about being
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.200]   a good friend or being a connected human that
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.000]   can help someone else heal is to help people
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.400]   feel seen, safe and soothed. And I say those
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.700]   three words and I've talked about this. I think
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.700]   I talked about it maybe even at Awaken, but
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:29.800]   seen, safe and soothed. Those three words were
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:33.000]   so helpful to me because sometimes I'm the bad
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   friend, right? It's not just that my needs
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.700]   aren't getting met with a friend. It's that
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.000]   when someone shares me, I want to share something
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.100]   with me and they share, hey, I'm anxious. I want
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.600]   to fix it. I want to help them fix it. I want
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.100]   to solve the problem because I don't like
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.800]   negative emotions and I'm going to fix your
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.000]   problem so we can move forward. And has that
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.100]   ever felt really good to people? Like that's
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.900]   never felt good to me. I don't know why I do
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.000]   that to people, but I do. And what those words
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.800]   gave me was a plan. So when someone is sharing
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.200]   something difficult with you, which I think
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.700]   you all should do tonight, I really do. It's
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.700]   really going to be fun. You're going to find
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.600]   somebody and you're going to share your anxious
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.900]   thoughts and it's going to be fun because here's
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.100]   the thing, just like last night was for me, with
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.200]   tears, it actually, I felt seen, I felt safe, and
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.100]   I felt soothed with those friends and there was
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.500]   something healing about it. And I will say it
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.400]   is not easy to do. I was so uncomfortable. I
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.200]   mean, my hands were sweating when I shared. I
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:30.700]   started bawling. I rambled. I did all the
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:34.500]   things. It was awkward. But I think being awkward
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   to be whole and healthy is very worth it. And so
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   what I would say is practice this together. And
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.700]   if you're good at this, I absolutely promise
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:47.100]   you, you will have friends. If you make people
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.600]   feel seen, safe, and soothed, you will have more
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.600]   friends than you know what to do with because
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.700]   nobody makes other people feel that way. If you
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:38:00.100]   listen, you don't judge, and you don't fix, and
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.900]   you comfort them, and you nod, and you care, and
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.000]   you say, "I'm so sorry," and that must have been
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.800]   so hard. And then before you launch into a sermon,
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:15.100]   stop yourself. You will have more friends than
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:15.800]   you know what to do with.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:21.700]   I know we're running long, so I'm going to try
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.800]   to say this really quick. And I have to say
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.500]   this because I'm big on community. If you don't
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.100]   have community, you need community. But I want
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.900]   to say something else on this topic of aloneness
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:37.300]   or loneliness is a huge benefit of Christianity
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.500]   is there's this repeated line in Scripture over
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:41.900]   and over. When God says something once, it's
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:43.900]   important. He says it twice, it's really important.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.300]   If he says it like 17 times, you need to really
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.700]   listen. And he says, "Never will I leave you, and
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:52.500]   never will I forsake you." And there may be a day
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.400]   where you are all alone. Like there may, I mean
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.300]   truly, there might be a day where I don't know
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.400]   what's going to happen. I don't know what the
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.300]   future holds. But you're not, because the benefit
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.700]   of Christianity is that you're with God. And so
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.500]   maybe you're at this place where you really
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:10.800]   are thinking about ending it or doing something
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:15.200]   drastic. I want you to know that God sees
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.100]   you. He loves you. And he has a plan for you.
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.500]   And that's not platitudes. I mean it. He's crazy
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.800]   about you. Not some future version of you. Not
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.600]   when you get right. Not when you get your act
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.900]   together. Not, you know, when you stop doing
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.800]   that thing you can't stop doing. But like right
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.600]   now. And if you have trusted in Jesus Christ,
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.900]   his death and resurrection for the forgiveness
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.900]   of your sins, like literally you see the cross
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.300]   as a payment for all the wrong things that you've
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.100]   done. You're going to be with him forever and
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:50.200]   ever and ever and ever. And so instead of taking
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:54.500]   your life, lose your life. Say, "God, here it is.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.500]   I want to end it all. But instead of ending it
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.900]   all, I'm just going to give it to you. What do
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.400]   you want to do with it? You want me to move
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.100]   overseas and serve the poor or care for lepers
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.200]   and get a disease that could kill me on me?
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.300]   I'll do it. I'll do whatever you want. You want
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.200]   me to go fight a war? I'll fight a war. You want
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.300]   me to stay here and wage war in corporate
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:19.200]   America and share the gospel with a stranger?
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.000]   Like I'll do anything. Here's my life. Instead
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.200]   of me taking my life, you take my life. I'm at
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:29.800]   the end of my rope. You take it." And this is
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.000]   it. And then I'm done. I won't say anything else.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   I found myself really alone one day and it
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.800]   wasn't at the low. It was at a high. I had just
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.100]   written a book. I had just built a house. My
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.100]   house had this booth that I had designed that
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.100]   I was so excited about in the kitchen. I was
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:49.900]   sitting at that booth and I felt so alone. And
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:53.200]   I was just like, "God, do you even see me? Like
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.400]   I'm here. I'm doing your work. Do you even see
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:00.200]   me?" And I remembered Tommy Nelson talking
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.800]   about his depression and just feeling so
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.200]   alone. He was walking through his garden and
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.100]   he saw a dead sparrow. And he remembered in
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.100]   Matthew chapter 10 that God says, "A sparrow
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.500]   doesn't hit the ground apart from my will. And
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.700]   two sparrows are sold for a penny. Do I not
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.000]   love you so much more than them?" And I just
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   thought, "Okay, he loves me like a sparrow." And
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   my phone rang and I'm telling you the truth.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.500]   My phone rang and it was a friend from college
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:31.000]   I hadn't talked to in, you know, over a year.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.800]   And I said, "Hello?" And he's like, "What's up,
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.800]   P?" And I was like, "What are you doing?" He said,
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.100]   "You're not going to believe it, man." And I
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.300]   was like, "No, what are you doing?" And he
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.200]   goes, "Man, I found these sparrows in my mailbox.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:45.600]   I'm on my way to some bird sanctuary to make
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:49.900]   sure they live." I'm dead serious. I'm still
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:53.200]   shitting at that booth. And God in his kind
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:58.500]   way just said, "You're not alone. I see you. I'm
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.400]   going to be with you soon. Hang on. Would you
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.600]   hold on? Stay in there. Stay in the fight. I
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:11.400]   got work for you to do." And I'm so glad. I'm
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.700]   so glad that I get to be with you here tonight.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.100]   I'm so glad that I get to be with these
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:15.600]   friends.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.900]   Yeah, so good. Thank you for saying that.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:25.700]   I want to wrap this up and then David, you
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:32.100]   can land the plane. I think, okay, I think we
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.500]   need to talk about social media just to kind
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.700]   of wrap it up because I think that a lot of
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.500]   us, just like we don't know what to do with
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.800]   anxiety, we don't know what to do with, we
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.900]   all know social media causes anxiety, causes
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.100]   comparison, causes all these issues. Social
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.200]   media, it's Satan's using this, Satan's using
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.200]   this. And actually, JP, I heard you say this
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.200]   at a luncheon not too long ago. You said,
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.700]   "We're all aware of it, but no one's doing
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.200]   anything about it." And I've thought about
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.600]   that multiple times since you said that. And
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.400]   I think, I know that I want to hear more
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.100]   about the tension y'all are in because if
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.900]   I had to guess, a lot of these people are
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:07.500]   following you three on social media and
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.000]   they're doing it because they want to learn
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.600]   from you. They want to learn more about
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:15.100]   these things. They want to, they want to
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.900]   be fed spiritually. They want to look up
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.600]   to leadership and all these different things.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.600]   There's good intent and social media can be
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:24.700]   a powerful weapon. We know that. But all
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.100]   three of you are on it. I'm on it. Most
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.900]   people like, the same, if you said who's on
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.100]   social media, but the same amount of people
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.300]   would raise their hands that also say they
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:36.200]   struggle with anxiety. And so you were kind
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.300]   of waging that war, JP, of saying like, "We
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:40.800]   all know it's this, but we're all still
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.700]   posting and we're all still doing it and
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.300]   no one's doing anything about it." How should
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.800]   we think about social media and the power
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.300]   that the enemy is using it for and then
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:56.000]   how also though, like, God is using it and
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   like, looking forward, how would you lead
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   us and how we should interact with it?
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   I mean, I mean, fast, fast from it regularly.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   And so I just saw, you know, today I take
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.800]   off an hour a day, a day a week, a week a
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.300]   month. Mike Kelsey says that a lot and I
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.600]   think that's a really good practice. When
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.300]   you do that 30 minutes of prayer, make
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.700]   sure your phone's in the other room. When
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.400]   you go to your profile to see how many
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.600]   followers you have, just know that that's
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.000]   harmful to you, most likely. I mean, maybe
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.600]   you're stronger than me, but I'll just
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.400]   speak firsthand, it's harmful to me to
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.200]   begin to count followers. My brain is
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.300]   constantly optimizing to know that if I
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.600]   post like this, I get more likes and, you
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.400]   know, that kind of thing. And so I have
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.600]   to really watch that because I don't want
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.500]   to find identity in those things. If it's
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.600]   a fast from it for for seasons and maybe
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.200]   do away with it altogether, like nobody's
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.800]   going to get to heaven and be mad that
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.000]   they had to live life without Instagram
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   or or TikTok, right? I mean, you see the
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.800]   latest dance or whatever it is, like
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.000]   you're going to be okay without the
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   trends. And and so I mean, there's there's
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.500]   nothing new under the sun. It's it's I
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.600]   don't have any better advice or counsel
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.300]   than that. I can't improve on that. It's
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.400]   just is fast from it and do away with it
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.500]   altogether if you need to. Hebrews 12
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.400]   says run the race that is set before you,
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.400]   throwing off the burden and the sin. I
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.600]   think the more that you have a race and
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.200]   you know what your vision is, then your
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.800]   days are busy and your days are full. And
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.400]   the less we think about ourselves and
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.000]   the less we think about what's wrong in
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.800]   the world and the more we're about the
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.600]   work right in front of us. You know, I
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.800]   mean, Scripture says that live a quiet
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.400]   life, work with your hands. I think that's
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.800]   so interesting. And I think we need to be
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.800]   okay and content doing hard work and
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.500]   doing good work. Many of you have jobs
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.400]   where you can browse the Internet during
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.600]   the day in your job. Don't. Don't. Do the
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.700]   work that's in front of you. Love the
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.100]   people that are in front of you. Take
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.800]   care of your little sphere, your little
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.700]   circle, and you just have less time for
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.900]   it. You just don't have as much time to
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.500]   be on it. Live the life that God
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.300]   intends you to live. I mean, what she's
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.100]   saying, we focus on the church so much
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:12.700]   on the don'ts. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:16.000]   Don't. No, just get busy doing the things
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.100]   that God has for you to do. For you are
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:19.800]   God's workmanship, created in Christ
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.800]   Jesus to do good works, which He has
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:24.600]   prepared in advance for you to do. And
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.600]   it literally says walk in the works, like
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.300]   poetry. Walk in the poem that, the poem
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.800]   that God has written before you were
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.900]   ever born. He's written for you to walk
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:36.300]   in. And as you do that, you know, who has
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.400]   time for a TikTok? Some of you need to
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.300]   walk out of here and you need a life
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.700]   plan. Some of you, the reason you're so
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.500]   anxious is you do not even know what
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:45.900]   you're doing. Your relationships are out
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:47.700]   of order. You do not eat well. You do not
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.400]   work out. You do not have any schedule to
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.400]   your life. You have chaos everywhere. You
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.100]   need to go out and really practically
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:56.100]   lay out, like, hey, I'm gonna wake up at
[00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:57.600]   this time. I'm gonna spend time with God.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.300]   I'm gonna work out. I'm gonna eat a
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:00.900]   little bit better. I'm not gonna drink so
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.100]   much at night or at all. Like, you need
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:05.100]   to make choices and then hold each other
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:06.800]   accountable because those small things
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.900]   are like medicine. They really are. And
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.200]   God knew it. And so this orderly life
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.600]   that he calls us to is actually a way of
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:18.000]   prospering. And so it's fun. I think it's
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.600]   fun to life plan. And I like what
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.000]   you're saying. -And canoe. -Canoe is my plan.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.400]   -I mean, here's the thing is I agree with
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.700]   what you're saying and it got me excited
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.400]   because I think we so often go, don't
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.600]   feel that. Don't think that. Don't fear.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.700]   And it's just not helpful. And I think
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.100]   what we need to do is get busy with this
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.600]   book and what he's called us to do in
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.000]   loving our people. And as we do, notice
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.100]   the burden and the sin in our life and
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.400]   throw it off. But don't let it consume us
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.300]   and distract us from what we're supposed
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:54.000]   to be doing. -On noted, related to all of
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.500]   those things, social media is not a bad
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.600]   thing or a good thing. It's a thing.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.800]   Like, the Apostle Paul, I think, would
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.000]   have loved social media. I mean, with a
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.200]   click of a button, you can share the
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.200]   gospel with millions of people. I mean,
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.700]   how dope would that have been? -I'm sharing
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:17.600]   the gospel with 10,000 people. -And yet,
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.700]   I think what both of them pointed to is
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.500]   doing an audit of asking, hey, what is
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.900]   happening? And auditing my feelings, my
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.900]   emotions, my thoughts, my take. What does
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:28.100]   it mean to take every thought captive?
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.400]   It means that just like when you go to
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.500]   the airport and you have a bag and you're
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.100]   going through security and the guy looks
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:32.900]   at it and he's like, man, you got a
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:34.400]   pocketknife in here, bro. We got to take
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.900]   this away. You're going to jail. He's
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:37.100]   going through and making sure the wrong
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:38.500]   things are not in that. And I think as it
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.300]   relates to our thoughts, anytime I'm
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.000]   feeling like auditing, man, I get on there
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.800]   and I feel depressed. I get on there when
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.500]   I'm distracted because I don't have a
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.200]   plan and so I just kind of gravitationally
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.900]   drift to that and auditing the feelings
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:51.600]   and thoughts that I'm having and how is
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.200]   it contributing. Auditing, when I find
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.300]   myself going, hey man, how many people
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.100]   are following me? Auditing, when I
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.400]   find myself going, oh man, I'm so
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.000]   discouraged because I see how amazing
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.200]   their life is and how disappointing I am,
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.200]   how disappointed I am that she just got
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.400]   engaged and I'm always the bride's man,
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.100]   never the bride and auditing those
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:13.700]   thoughts. And I think that's a lost art.
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.000]   I don't think that people do. And I
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.700]   certainly, candidly, I'm not always great
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.900]   at that and I have to do that to the
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.700]   Lord and say, here's what I'm feeling,
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:24.200]   God. Here's what I'm thinking. Here's
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.700]   what is going on in my heart and going
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:29.400]   to God honestly and sharing things that
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.300]   I'm feeling.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.700]   - That's good. A theme I've just heard
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.800]   throughout tonight is let people in and
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.400]   be honest. You just have to be honest
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.600]   with yourself and quit playing the game
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.400]   and got to be honest. Got to start being
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.200]   honest. So, could you help me thank our
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.800]   friends, JP, Jenny, David.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.600]   (audience applause)
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.600]   I actually want, JP, would you mind
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.600]   praying for us and then David, you
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.800]   could talk to us a little bit.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.900]   - I'd love to. Father, we just need
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:59.600]   your help. The enemy's lying to us and
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.700]   he's telling us that we can't tell
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:04.300]   anybody that we're struggling. And so
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.400]   would you stir in us by the power of
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.600]   your Holy Spirit of courage to be known,
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:14.900]   to be vulnerable. Even tonight, like
[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:18.600]   just there's someone I know that is just
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.400]   like, I can't do that. And I pray that
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.800]   they would turn to the person to the
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.100]   right or the left and find a safe place
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:26.900]   and that that person would have the
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:28.400]   courage to put their arm around them
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.600]   and stay with them until they're helped,
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:34.900]   until they get the aid that they need.
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:36.500]   And so Lord, if there's anybody in this
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:40.200]   place watching online, listening later,
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.300]   right now driving in their car, wherever
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.800]   they're at, Father, would you remind
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.100]   them that you love them in the same
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:50.300]   ways that you have me so many times?
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.800]   Would you remind them that you love
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:56.400]   them? That you have a plan and a purpose
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.100]   for their life that is worthwhile?
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:02.200]   Would you even give them a vision for it?
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.900]   And would you surround them with people
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:07.000]   who know them and love you and love them
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.500]   and know you and would offer them
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:14.700]   godly accountability? Father, I thank you
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:18.800]   so much for Jesus. I thank you that you
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:22.300]   purchased a glorious inheritance for us
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:24.600]   in eternity and that you're keeping it
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.200]   safe and that you sealed us by your
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.400]   Holy Spirit and that in this world as
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:33.600]   we have trouble, you are preserving us.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.600]   And so as our bodies are wasting away
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.100]   like jars of clay, as they're being
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:39.400]   broken, Lord, I pray that you would
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:41.000]   preserve us, that you would strengthen
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.400]   us and in the midst of temptation, that
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.800]   you would strengthen us and that you
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:49.200]   would lead us according to your will.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:53.000]   In the name of your Son, Jesus Christ,
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.500]   amen. Amen.
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.800]   - This, I shared earlier that I would
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:04.200]   share from Mark chapter 4 and I'll say
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:07.700]   this, this series on anxiety and mental
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.100]   health and punctuate everything that we've
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:11.800]   just gone through the last four weeks.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.900]   My son, when he was three and four and
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:18.000]   even sometimes today at five, he'll come
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.500]   into our room late at night, three in
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:25.400]   the morning and he'll walk in and he'll
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:27.800]   come over to my bed and he'll wake me
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.600]   up and he'll say, "Dad, Dad, there's
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.400]   monsters underneath my bed."
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:37.100]   And I always find myself going, you know,
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:39.100]   waking up and seeing, it looks like
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.100]   children of the corn, this silhouette of
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:45.200]   somebody walking at me just, "Dad, ah!"
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.400]   And if I'm honest, there's part of me
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.300]   that kind of loves that he does that.
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:51.700]   And here's why, it's not because I like
[00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:54.900]   being woken up at three in the morning.
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.400]   It's because when he does that, it
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.500]   communicates something.
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:05.400]   It communicates that he believes that if
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:10.700]   I have a problem, I can go to my dad.
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.200]   And that he can do something about it.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.900]   Whatever monsters are there, I can go,
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:19.100]   and my dad is strong enough to handle it.
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:21.400]   Mark chapter four, Jesus is on this boat
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:23.300]   and the disciples are out in the middle
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.800]   of this lake, it's late at night, and
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.100]   they're rowing across.
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.300]   It says that Jesus was asleep in the
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:32.000]   middle of the boat on a cushion.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.600]   And a great storm hit all around him.
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.000]   And the disciples began to panic.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.100]   And these were fishermen for a living.
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.100]   They'd seen storms.
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:43.600]   They were used to storms.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:44.900]   But the word used, it was like an
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:48.300]   earthquake on the water.
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.100]   It'd be the equivalent of pilots.
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:52.500]   Man, they fly through turbulence and
[00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:53.700]   they're okay, but when the pilots
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:55.200]   begin to freak out about the turbulence,
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.600]   that's essentially what happens.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:58.000]   And they go to Jesus and they wake him up.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.200]   And Jesus asks a really interesting question.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.000]   The disciples say, "Lord, don't you care
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.200]   that we're perishing?
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:08.900]   We're going to die."
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:11.700]   And Jesus gets up from that cushion and
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:17.300]   he walks and he says, "Be still!"
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:20.600]   And the water turns to glass.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:28.500]   And then he asks what I think is so profound.
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:33.700]   He says, "Why are you so afraid?"
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:34.600]   And why is that profound?
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:35.300]   Think about what he said.
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:37.100]   I mean, the disciples are going,
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:38.400]   "What do you mean, 'Why are we afraid?'
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.300]   We were about to die.
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.200]   The boat was going to turn over.
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.600]   What do you mean, 'Why are we afraid?'"
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.800]   This is the plane is going down in midair
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.700]   and we're all freaking out.
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:46.000]   And you're like, "Hey, guys, what's going on?
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.600]   Why are you so afraid?
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:51.300]   What do you mean, 'Why are we afraid?'
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.100]   Do you not have any faith?
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:57.800]   Don't you know who's with you?"
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:02.100]   Now, God, he wants us to walk through this life
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:04.400]   with the type of relationship that whatever I face,
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:08.800]   my God is strong enough to calm the storms,
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:11.300]   like a father is strong enough to face the monsters
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:12.600]   under the bed.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.500]   He is with me and he's invited me to bring
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:18.300]   all of those things to me
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:21.000]   because he's strong enough to deal with them
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:26.500]   and he cares for me and he cares for you.
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:29.000]   And I hope you leave with an understanding
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.400]   that is who your God is.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.400]   The wind and the waves obey him.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.700]   He is nearer.
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:38.400]   He's nearer to you than the breath that you breathe.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:43.200]   And your God is strong and he is for you.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:46.100]   If you've never trusted in Jesus,
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:47.200]   you're not gonna experience the peace
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.100]   we talked about in this series
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:49.600]   because you don't know the Prince of Peace.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.700]   You don't know the one who gave his life
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:54.400]   so that you would spend eternity with God for forever,
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.000]   not by how good you are,
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.400]   but by receiving him as the payment for your sin.
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:01.300]   Tonight is your night.
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:03.400]   And God, in a moment of faith, just saying,
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.100]   "God, I believe that.
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:04.900]   I receive that.
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:06.100]   I accept that."
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:08.000]   Your eternity will never be the same.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.500]   Your ability to experience peace in this life
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.000]   will actually be possible.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.900]   And tonight, the God who is there,
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:17.000]   who 2,000 years ago gave his life for you,
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.200]   is inviting you into that.
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.200]   For those of us who do know him,
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.600]   we're gonna worship one last time in song.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.700]   And Father, we thank you
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.300]   that you have made a way through the cross
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:30.100]   by what you did in our place
[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:33.900]   for us to have peace in this life and eternity forever.
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.700]   Thank you for Jenny and JP and J.D.
[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:37.400]   and just a chance to talk about ways
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.000]   that you invite us to peace.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.100]   Would you allow us to live in that freedom?
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:42.300]   We worship you now in song.
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:42.800]   Amen.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:52.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
