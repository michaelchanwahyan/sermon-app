1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:20,520
 - All right, we're back, let's do it.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,120
 Hey, help me welcome our Porch Live locations.

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,640
 I'm gonna say all of them and then let's all go ballistic.

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,800
 Okay, here we go.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,440
 Welcome Porch Live North Houston.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,040
 Porch Live Tulsa.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,720
 Porch Live Indy.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,880
 And a special welcome to Porch Live Fort Worth.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,240
 (audience cheering)

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,440
 All of our friends tuning in live wherever you are,

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,980
 my friends in the room in Dallas,

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,040
 we're so glad that you are here.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,740
 We're taking a break from series.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,080
 We just wrapped up POV,

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,240
 point of view from the disciples and those around Jesus.

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,080
 And I'm really excited we're heading tonight.

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,120
 Before I do that, if you're just now tuning in,

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,200
 if you're listening at a later day, watching a later day,

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,000
 we just announced our Awaken theme, the rehearsal.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,380
 It's gonna be awesome, September 3rd through 5th.

22
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,680
 Check it out at awaken.live.

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,360
 But that's then, tonight, I wanna start off.

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,920
 Raise your hand if you have ever been ripped off or scammed.

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,400
 Uh-huh, yep.

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,840
 Hi, my name is JD Rogers.

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,240
 I have been ripped off and scammed.

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,100
 I wanna talk about one of the biggest scams to exist.

29
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,420
 And some of you, even my Enneagram sevens

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,200
 might get really upset about this

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,600
 because you love adventure and thrill

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,080
 and spontaneity or whatever.

33
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,280
 Spirit Airlines.

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,120
 Let me just get on my soapbox real quick.

35
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:46,240
 Unless you like stuffing wrinkly clothes into a backpack,

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,440
 it's a scam.

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,220
 Because I remember my first time using Spirit.

38
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,960
 I got into Expedia, comparing all my prices,

39
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,000
 and I'm like, it's like 200, 200, 200,

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,040
 and it's like $53.

41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,860
 And I'm like, dang, all right, click.

42
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,420
 Y'all have all been there, you've been there.

43
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,460
 So I click on it and it's like, well, pay to,

44
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,420
 or add a bag, $75.

45
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,260
 And I'm like, all right, I mean, I need a bag,

46
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,380
 you know, whatever.

47
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,940
 Click on it, and then it's like, oh, select a seat, $25.

48
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,120
 I'm like, select a seat?

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,820
 No other airlines made me do that.

50
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,300
 And I look at the end of it, and it's like $10 cheaper.

51
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,280
 And I'm like, you know what, whatever.

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,380
 I thought it was gonna be way cheaper, but I'll do it.

53
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,580
 It's $10 cheaper.

54
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,020
 So then I click it.

55
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,060
 This is when I knew I was scammed.

56
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,060
 I get to the airport and I'm looking at, you know,

57
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,260
 United, Delta, all these different ones.

58
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,100
 I'm like, those are nice.

59
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,900
 And then I see that yellow.

60
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,880
 (audience laughing)

61
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,660
 And I'm like, all right, it's quaint.

62
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,100
 And so I get on, you know, and I'm like, excuse me,

63
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,620
 sorry, sorry, you know, sorry, ow, ow, sorry.

64
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,180
 And I get into my seat and it's like, you know,

65
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,160
 and then my bag that I paid, you know, $85,000 for

66
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,980
 is in my lap pretty much.

67
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,000
 And it's the only time I can look around and see like,

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,780
 this plane isn't the safest thing.

69
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,160
 Like, why is it called Spirit, first off?

70
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,320
 I mean, am I about to?

71
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,460
 And so I'm sitting on the plane,

72
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,300
 but that just came to me from the Spirit, you could say.

73
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,700
 So, okay, sorry.

74
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,940
 My friends are viewing me.

75
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,880
 Where was I?

76
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,160
 Oh yeah, so I'm sitting there, I'm looking around,

77
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,800
 I'm like, this doesn't seem very safe.

78
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,160
 I think I got scammed.

79
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,160
 It was the only time I actually ever listened

80
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,820
 to the like flight attendant's instructions.

81
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,460
 I'm like looking for my mask,

82
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,220
 'cause I'm like, this does not look safe.

83
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,180
 It needed to say, I got off,

84
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,720
 and the first thing I said was, man, that was a ripoff.

85
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,680
 I start there because I wanna talk about

86
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,700
 one of the biggest ripoffs or scams that the world sells us.

87
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,700
 And it's sexual freedom and sexual exploration.

88
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,620
 Because the world sells us that sexual freedom

89
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,480
 comes with no cost.

90
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:02,140
 But that's the biggest scam that culture sells us.

91
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,660
 And some of you might not be convinced of that.

92
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,340
 I hope that by the end of the night, you will see

93
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,100
 that culture says, hey, in order to be free,

94
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,540
 you can do what you want, when you want with your body,

95
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,820
 'cause it's your body.

96
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,500
 And whatever makes you happy, do it.

97
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,820
 Well, when people are feeding that to a bunch of hormone,

98
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,400
 raging, all the things, testosterone,

99
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,500
 that make up young adults who are single

100
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,420
 and have sex drives, and we hear,

101
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,220
 do what you want with your body,

102
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,220
 and do what makes you happy, we're like a bunch of rabbits.

103
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,060
 It's insane.

104
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,500
 And so the problem is, culture says,

105
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,700
 this is what makes you feel free.

106
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,060
 This is what makes you have fun.

107
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,700
 But here's why we're having this talk tonight.

108
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,980
 The title of my message tonight

109
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,700
 is simply Battling Sexual Sin.

110
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,340
 And the reason why I wanted to have this talk

111
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,180
 is because last week, if you were here with us,

112
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,100
 DMARV wrapped up POV talking about shame.

113
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,900
 And he asked all of you to write down a thing

114
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,020
 that makes you most shameful on a card

115
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,180
 and to bring it forward.

116
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,820
 And the team got together on Wednesday

117
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,940
 and we went through thousands upon thousands of cards

118
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,860
 and our hearts were broken because our very own people

119
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,740
 represented in this room, praise God,

120
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,500
 hopefully they were set free.

121
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,260
 But here's a lot of what we saw.

122
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,480
 And guys, I just spent some time with all of these cards,

123
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,500
 and I mean card after card.

124
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:38,060
 Lust, porn, sex, women, sexual abuse, sexual thoughts.

125
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,400
 I'm sorry, God, you know what I did.

126
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,460
 Porn, sex, masturbation.

127
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,180
 My struggle is with pornography.

128
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,100
 Homosexuality, sexual sin that I choose to do.

129
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,340
 Boys taking advantage of me.

130
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,100
 Past sexual perversion, past sexual sin

131
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,180
 and lustful thoughts.

132
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,180
 Prostitution, lust, masturbation, lust, pornography.

133
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,260
 Pornography and masturbation, porn.

134
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,580
 Jealousy, embarrassment and my sexual sins.

135
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:21,740
 Broken relationships, porn, lust, sexual abuse,

136
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,020
 masturbation, porn, lust, sexual abuse,

137
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,300
 masturbation, homosexuality, secret sexual sin.

138
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,520
 Over and over and over again.

139
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,860
 And it just did something to me.

140
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,900
 And we're starting off, I'm just gonna tell us,

141
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,460
 it's gonna be more on the serious side of a message,

142
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,500
 just brother to brothers and sisters.

143
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,760
 We've all just been wrecked this week.

144
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,060
 To just see card after card of people acknowledging,

145
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,300
 I think you're not as surprised.

146
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,460
 I think that you know the fact that you wrote in a card,

147
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,960
 you are saying, hey, I've been buying a lie.

148
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,220
 I've been ripped off.

149
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,480
 I've been scammed.

150
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,140
 But my fear is, is that a lot of us

151
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,060
 have written those things on a card before.

152
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,660
 And some of you might have written on this card

153
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,060
 and this week found yourself maybe not feeling as much shame

154
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,380
 because of the cross, but still in your sin.

155
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,660
 That you left your shame at the stage

156
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,060
 and down in this bucket,

157
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,720
 but the struggle was still waiting for you

158
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,700
 when you got home.

159
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,820
 And tonight, it's a message of both challenge and hope.

160
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,240
 Because on this side of heaven,

161
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,660
 we will constantly be battling all types of sin,

162
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,620
 but specifically in our young adult years,

163
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,020
 I mean, it just seems that we will really be battling

164
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,660
 sexual sin as single young adults,

165
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,780
 as married young adults, it doesn't go away.

166
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,580
 But in this battle, I think a lot of us wonder,

167
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,480
 can I actually be free?

168
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,640
 Can I actually defeat this addiction?

169
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,000
 Can I win the battle against sexual sin?

170
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And I wanna tell you, the answer is through Jesus, yes.

171
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,800
 You can, you can, because of Jesus.

172
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,160
 And so tonight will be, like I said,

173
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,160
 a message of challenge and hope, hope in Jesus.

174
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,600
 Because left to ourself, we cannot, and we'll see that.

175
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,480
 My hope for this message is that you would see

176
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,680
 that your story does not end with your sexual past.

177
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,440
 Your story does not end with what's happened to you sexually

178
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,360
 and you are not defined by what you have done

179
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,940
 or currently are doing sexually.

180
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,160
 That you can, with Jesus, defeat your sexual sin

181
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,280
 because culture, like I said, it's throwing at us Tinder

182
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,480
 for hookups, Snapchat for sexting, porn sites,

183
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,800
 now virtual reality porn, Twitter for anything you want,

184
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,360
 hookup culture, OnlyFans, all these different things.

185
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,560
 Culture says, take this if you wanna be free,

186
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,560
 yet bound, shamed, addicted.

187
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:21,240
 And so tonight, I wanna break the chains of sexual addiction

188
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,000
 and sexual sin with the power that Jesus offers.

189
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,520
 I wanna do that by taking a look at one

190
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,160
 of the greatest kings in the Old Testament.

191
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,000
 So if you have your Bible,

192
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,160
 open up to 2 Samuel chapter 11.

193
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,520
 And we're gonna look at King David,

194
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:43,320
 a man that if he had taken care of his sexual sin,

195
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,080
 rather than it taking care of him,

196
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,840
 he was a man marked for most of his life

197
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,560
 in the story of 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel

198
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,680
 by a man after God's own heart,

199
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,760
 a man categorized by great faith,

200
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,480
 the young boy that when everyone else was afraid,

201
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,280
 of the giant Goliath, he in faith got up

202
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,120
 and declared who his God was,

203
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,000
 and he knocked him down with nothing but a sling and a stone

204
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,880
 that's who he was, a man of great faith.

205
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,400
 But sadly, that's not where his story ended

206
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,240
 because not only was he marked by faith,

207
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,800
 but one of the things that David is marked by now

208
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,160
 to generations after generations is his greatest failure.

209
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,920
 And we're gonna read about that right here

210
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,780
 in 2 Samuel chapter 11, verse one.

211
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,300
 (pages rustling)

212
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,140
 In the spring of the year,

213
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,500
 the time when kings go out to battle,

214
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,860
 David sent Joab and his servants with him in all Israel,

215
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,020
 and they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah,

216
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,580
 but David remained at Jerusalem.

217
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,500
 It happened late one afternoon

218
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,060
 when David arose from his couch

219
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,500
 and was walking on the roof of the king's house

220
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,420
 that he saw from the roof a woman bathing,

221
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,540
 and the woman was very beautiful.

222
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,500
 And David sent and inquired about the woman,

223
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,740
 and one said, "Hey, is not this Bathsheba,

224
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,580
 the daughter of Elion, the wife of Uriah, the Hittite?"

225
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,420
 So David sent messengers and took her,

226
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,940
 and she came to him, and he lay with her.

227
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,260
 Now she had been purifying herself of her uncleanness.

228
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,500
 Then she returned to her house, and the woman conceived,

229
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,440
 and she sent and told David,

230
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,660
 "I am pregnant, and you are the father."

231
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,940
 I mean, a real-time Jerry Springer happening right here

232
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,780
 in 2 Samuel.

233
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,660
 Today, we're gonna look at the first few verses

234
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,700
 that were the path that led to David's failure,

235
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,860
 the battle that he had with his sin that he lost,

236
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,540
 but hopefully it was not for nothing,

237
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,780
 that we can redeem it by using it as an example

238
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,140
 to how we should live our life.

239
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,260
 I think one of the problems

240
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,980
 that people still struggle with sin year after year

241
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,180
 is because they do everything they can to attack the sin.

242
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,260
 No porn, no porn, no sex, no sex,

243
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,660
 and they give no attention to the path that led to the sin.

244
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,420
 They don't spend time rewinding the tapes and backing up

245
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,100
 because maybe it's a little uncomfortable or a little uneasy

246
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,260
 or honestly, it just takes a lot of effort.

247
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,260
 So we'd rather say, "No, no, no,

248
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,020
 "I just won't text them anymore,"

249
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,860
 or, "No, no, no, I just won't get on that site anymore.

250
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,540
 "I won't do those things,"

251
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,500
 but yet you're not strong enough,

252
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
 and you keep doing it and keep doing it.

253
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,420
 So just really simply put tonight for my note takers,

254
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,240
 five steps to win the battle against sexual sin.

255
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,380
 Five steps, they're gonna be all R's, nice and neat for you.

256
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,940
 Five steps to win the battle against sexual sin,

257
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,460
 just going verse by verse

258
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,460
 in the path that led to David's failure.

259
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,920
 Verse one, "In the spring of the year,

260
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,280
 "the time when kings go out to battle."

261
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,980
 It's like Samuel was exposing my man David

262
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,900
 'cause David was a king meant to be in battle.

263
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,060
 So he's just emphasizing,

264
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,940
 yeah, the spring of the year,

265
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,700
 the time when kings were supposed to be at battle,

266
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,300
 hint, hint.

267
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,300
 David sent Joab and his servants and all Israel,

268
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,740
 everyone else but himself.

269
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,180
 And they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah,

270
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,540
 but David remained at Jerusalem.

271
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,080
 I mean, it's like Samuel is writing

272
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,620
 and really wanting us to notice something here

273
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,140
 that was already wrong.

274
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,820
 The first problem that David made is our first step

275
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,620
 to battling against sexual sin.

276
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,020
 The first step to fight sexual sin is to remember

277
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,740
 who you are and what you are called to do.

278
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,460
 Remember who you are and what you are called to do.

279
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,800
 So what is Samuel trying to show us here?

280
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
 Who was David?

281
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,740
 A king anointed by God,

282
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,740
 chosen to lead God's chosen people into great purpose,

283
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,140
 into great heights,

284
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,260
 to be the strongest nation in all the land.

285
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,120
 That was who he was, chosen by God to be royalty.

286
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,640
 And what was he called to do?

287
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,360
 Go to war, lead the war.

288
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,200
 The reason why I wanted to start with remembering

289
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,460
 who you are and what you are called to do

290
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,180
 is because remembering requires something mental.

291
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,240
 And if you don't take away anything tonight practical,

292
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,820
 here's what I want you to take away.

293
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,080
 You will be what you think you are.

294
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,080
 You will be or you will do

295
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,320
 based off of what you believe you are.

296
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,980
 In this moment, we see David clearly forgot who he was

297
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,700
 and what he was called to do.

298
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,740
 Because if he remembered,

299
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,740
 I am a king anointed and chosen by the God of the universe

300
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:57,100
 called to lead and stand up and be a man and go to war,

301
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,180
 it would have changed everything about this moment.

302
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,680
 But because he forgot who he was

303
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,100
 and his purpose and his calling,

304
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,820
 because he neglected his character and his calling,

305
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,020
 he found himself home when everyone else was at war.

306
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,420
 That is often when you will fall

307
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,940
 is when you are at home,

308
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,840
 when you're meant to be in the battle.

309
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,940
 So for David, that's great.

310
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,680
 King, anointed by God, job, go to war.

311
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,100
 As a Christian in 2022, who are we?

312
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,580
 What are we called to do?

313
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,140
 First Peter puts it really simple for us.

314
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,300
 First Peter 2, nine says, but you are not like that.

315
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,340
 If you read the previous verses, he's talking about,

316
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,220
 you're not like the world, you're not like darkness,

317
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,020
 you are different.

318
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,540
 That's us.

319
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,620
 You are a chosen people.

320
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,220
 See the parallel between David chosen to be king,

321
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,020
 we are a chosen people, not only chosen and just people,

322
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,060
 but you are royal priest.

323
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,580
 In Christ, we inherit who he is,

324
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,140
 therefore you and I, we're royalty.

325
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,620
 It gets even better.

326
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,020
 We're a holy nation.

327
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,900
 Lastly, we are God's very own possession.

328
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:21,820
 That is who you are, chosen, royalty,

329
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,380
 a nation set apart,

330
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,320
 and you are personally important to God.

331
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,160
 You are his very own possession.

332
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,780
 And then he says, as a result, look at it,

333
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,880
 just right there in the text.

334
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,900
 As a result, because of who you are, here's what you do.

335
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,380
 As a result of who you are,

336
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:47,380
 your calling is show others the goodness of God.

337
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,500
 For he called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

338
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,300
 So who are you?

339
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,580
 Royalty, chosen, God's very own possession.

340
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,080
 What are you called to do?

341
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,820
 Walk away from darkness, step into his wonderful light

342
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,620
 and live like it.

343
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,940
 Step into the battle against darkness,

344
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,000
 wage war against your flesh

345
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,040
 and live as if you are a chosen child of God.

346
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,380
 And so when the enemy tries to come and lure you away

347
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,120
 and try to get you and culture tries to get you

348
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,040
 to forget who you are, you have to remember,

349
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,240
 remember what this verse says.

350
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,520
 Every single one of you, but despite what you feel,

351
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,760
 despite what you've been told,

352
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,320
 despite other people have treated you,

353
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,560
 you are chosen in God's very own possession.

354
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,100
 And you have a responsibility now to live like it's true.

355
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,980
 But if you forget, you will live like the world.

356
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,800
 Darkness will look really appetizing to you.

357
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,760
 Sexual sin will suddenly sound really good to you

358
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,060
 because when we go and choose to follow

359
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,280
 the temptation of sexual sin,

360
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,240
 it's because something in us feels like it's lacking.

361
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,080
 The reason why I want to start with a mental practical step

362
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,480
 is because mentally, when I talk to young adults

363
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,120
 who fell again to porn, fell again to hooking up,

364
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,120
 fell again to lustful desires and fantasizing, masturbation,

365
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,380
 I'll ask them about their day and I'll say,

366
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,880
 what, tell me about your day.

367
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,420
 All right, why did you do that?

368
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,400
 Why did you do that?

369
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,880
 Why did you do that?

370
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,640
 And what it always comes down to slowly but surely

371
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,220
 is what we can track is it started with a belief.

372
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,220
 For a lot of times, guys, something made them feel insecure.

373
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,640
 A girl neglected them, rejected them.

374
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,040
 A girl's never said yes to them.

375
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,560
 A girl cheated on them.

376
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,760
 Their dad never showed his approval of them.

377
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,320
 There's a void, there's something lacking.

378
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,720
 And so they go searching and you know

379
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,980
 who never puts them down?

380
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,240
 The person on the screen.

381
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,120
 You know who never neglects them?

382
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,680
 Porn's always there.

383
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,480
 You know what's always there for them to go

384
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,160
 and to meet that need and to fill that void with?

385
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,440
 A screen, an image, a person.

386
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,380
 But I'm telling you, it's a scam.

387
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,180
 It's telling you this is where you can find freedom.

388
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,560
 This is where you can find life.

389
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,640
 This is where you can fill that void.

390
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,040
 But then you know what you feel after.

391
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,040
 And you have to wake up and remember,

392
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,520
 no, no, no, when I feel this way,

393
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
 when my thoughts are going down a dark path,

394
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,360
 when I feel insecure, or ladies,

395
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,840
 when you don't feel worthy, or you feel invalidated,

396
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,760
 or you don't feel chosen, or like you're enough,

397
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,200
 or if you just look like someone else

398
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,540
 and you're struggling with comparison

399
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,160
 and you wanna run to wrong guys

400
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,040
 or all these different things,

401
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,400
 you have to stop and simply remember,

402
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,880
 the world will rip me off.

403
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,880
 But in Christ, I am royalty, I'm chosen,

404
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,440
 I'm God's very own possession.

405
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,680
 Therefore, I have a responsibility to live like it's true

406
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,120
 by displaying the goodness of God,

407
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,720
 by knowing God and making Him known.

408
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,500
 That is who I am.

409
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,340
 That is what I'm called to do.

410
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,000
 Not by my own strength, but His.

411
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,880
 David, his first problem was he forgot who he was.

412
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,100
 Step number two,

413
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,700
 recognize where you're susceptible.

414
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,600
 Look at verse two.

415
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,440
 It happened late one afternoon.

416
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,240
 I just love how Samuel keeps like

417
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,080
 giving us more details than we asked for.

418
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,280
 It happened, let's say around four or five o'clock,

419
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,160
 give or take, when David arose from his couch.

420
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,000
 I'm like, they got couches back then?

421
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,240
 Leather, you know, what kind was it?

422
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,160
 Was walking on the roof of the king's house.

423
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,180
 You ever heard of idle time is the devil's playground?

424
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,720
 He's walking around on the roof.

425
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,200
 That he saw from the roof a woman bathing

426
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,640
 and the woman was very beautiful.

427
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,000
 If we're gonna fight the battle against sexual sin,

428
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,820
 we have to recognize where we are susceptible

429
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,520
 to fall to sexual sin.

430
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,800
 Another way of saying this is we have to look for patterns.

431
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,320
 Patterns often point to problems.

432
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,000
 If you have a reoccurring problem in your life,

433
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,340
 if you have an addiction in your life,

434
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,640
 look at the pattern that leads to the problem.

435
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,040
 I am convinced with the more and more of you that I meet,

436
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,400
 and as I think back to my like single years,

437
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,000
 my high school years, 99% of sexual sins

438
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,360
 I think would go away if we got rid of couches.

439
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,760
 I'm serious.

440
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,280
 Like, you know what I'm saying, Josiah?

441
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,840
 Like, couches are always just a spot

442
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,720
 where no good takes place.

443
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,540
 Your girl's sitting across, it's late,

444
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,960
 your parents go to bed,

445
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,720
 the movie lights hitting her just right.

446
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,280
 Probably like George Lopez on the TV, I don't know.

447
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,720
 (audience laughing)

448
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,800
 You're like, is it hot?

449
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,900
 Like, what's going on?

450
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,600
 Toes start connecting.

451
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,240
 Yeah. (laughing)

452
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,680
 There's like two responses, toes, toes.

453
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,680
 (audience laughing)

454
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,520
 But the point that I'm trying to articulate here

455
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,520
 is you need to think about the times,

456
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,880
 like ask yourself this question,

457
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,640
 write it down and think about it.

458
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,720
 When the devil attacks, where am I?

459
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,240
 When and where does he attack?

460
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,020
 When does he present sexual sin?

461
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,880
 Oftentimes, it's when we are alone,

462
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,480
 isolated, and on our couch.

463
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,740
 I don't know what the couch is for you.

464
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,440
 The couch might be your room alone at night.

465
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,900
 The couch might be in your Instagram DMs

466
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,140
 when you said you're gonna delete Instagram.

467
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,740
 The couch might be when you take them home in the car

468
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,660
 and you should have walked them to your door,

469
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,080
 but you stayed inside for too long.

470
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,500
 I don't know what the couch is in your life,

471
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,180
 but you need to think about the patterns

472
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,900
 that point to your problem.

473
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,980
 When do you fall to sexual sin?

474
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,860
 And some of you might be thinking right now,

475
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,080
 what even classifies as sexual sin?

476
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,740
 Is making out sexual sin?

477
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,020
 I'm gonna leave that between you and the Lord.

478
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,420
 I'm not gonna say yes or no.

479
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,980
 Here's what I'll say just to give it to you straight.

480
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,580
 Let's be big boys and big girls.

481
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:35,460
 Sex, oral sex, sex in ways that shouldn't be sex,

482
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:42,900
 getting too handsy, making out while bumping and grinding,

483
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,300
 getting hot and steamy, you know what I'm talking about.

484
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,860
 Being alone, looking at things

485
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,840
 that cause you to be sexually aroused,

486
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,100
 entertaining yourself.

487
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,620
 And then just to make sure I hit everything,

488
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,900
 if you and your significant other

489
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,520
 or the person that you tend to hook up with

490
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,820
 had to ask yourself, are we towing the line?

491
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,540
 Yes, you are.

492
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,380
 You're towing the line.

493
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,260
 If you have to ask yourself, I think we're towing the line,

494
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,980
 it's 'cause there's something in you telling you

495
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,820
 that you're towing the line and you need to reel it back.

496
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,720
 And you need to look and go, in light of all those things,

497
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,000
 when I fall to porn, when I fall to masturbation,

498
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,560
 when I fall to hooking up, when does it happen?

499
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,520
 When does it start?

500
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,600
 Where am I?

501
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,200
 If it's when you're in your house alone

502
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,780
 because you don't have a roommate in your room,

503
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,620
 get a roommate.

504
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,120
 If you live alone in an apartment

505
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,920
 and you're hooking up all the time, get three roommates.

506
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,240
 Like, but I'm an introvert.

507
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,820
 Wanna be free, get three roommates.

508
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,300
 I'm serious.

509
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,740
 If you're saying, well, I don't have community,

510
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,680
 I don't have people, move to where they are.

511
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,800
 If it's apps on your phone, get rid of the apps.

512
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,520
 Whatever it is that is the pattern

513
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,520
 that leads to you falling to sexual sin,

514
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,280
 recognize where you're susceptible

515
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,360
 and remove it out of your life.

516
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,560
 David was meant to be at war.

517
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,120
 He was on the couch.

518
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,580
 Proverbs 18 one says,

519
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,220
 "Whoever isolates himself, seeks his own desire,

520
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,680
 "he breaks out against all sound judgment."

521
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,740
 When I'm in isolation, there's a word that's helped me.

522
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,060
 It's an acronym called HALT.

523
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,260
 And when I'm any of these things,

524
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,080
 I literally have to halt and think about what am I doing

525
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,840
 and where do I need to go to get out of this situation?

526
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,840
 Hungry, angry, lonely, tired,

527
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,260
 and add bored, HALT-BA, all right?

528
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:48,700
 When I'm hungry, angry, lonely, or tired or bored,

529
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,320
 I gotta get up and do something

530
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,420
 'cause I know I'm susceptible to fall.

531
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:57,140
 I have to rearrange my life to not fall to sexual sin

532
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,700
 because I have recognized where I'm susceptible.

533
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,220
 Recently, what that looked like for me,

534
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,100
 I spend way too much time scrolling on TikTok

535
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,300
 and put something in me,

536
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,420
 it's like, well, if you're gonna be speaking

537
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,020
 to young adults, you gotta be relevant

538
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,660
 and know all the things.

539
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,580
 It's not worth it.

540
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,660
 It's taking time.

541
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,660
 So you know what I did?

542
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,200
 Hold down that little nice shaky thing, delete.

543
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,100
 Some of you, you think, oh, I can't live without it.

544
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,420
 You can, you can.

545
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,580
 For me, friends wanna hang out,

546
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,580
 but I haven't spent time relying on God

547
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,720
 and being with God that day.

548
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,380
 And something in me thinks, wait,

549
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,380
 can you be self-sufficient today?

550
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,060
 'Cause it usually starts with me.

551
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,180
 If I'm gonna go down a path that leads to sin,

552
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,500
 it starts with thinking that I can do life without God.

553
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,640
 So I have to rearrange my plans and go, God, I need you.

554
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,420
 Recognize where you're susceptible

555
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,260
 and rearrange accordingly.

556
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,260
 The next one, resist the urge

557
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,300
 to give in to your sexual desires.

558
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:07,860
 Verse three, and David sent and inquired about the woman.

559
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:12,220
 David sent and inquired about the woman.

560
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,860
 He saw a woman bathing on the roof.

561
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:20,040
 And in that moment, he had a decision.

562
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,740
 He could have said, oh, that ain't my wife,

563
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,280
 and kept walking and said, what did he do?

564
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,220
 (imitates car horn)

565
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,180
 Like he like looked and sat, and it says he inquired.

566
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:34,140
 And I don't have to explain what sexual urge is, correct?

567
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,060
 We're old enough in this room?

568
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,500
 Yeah, Christian, oh yeah.

569
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,180
 (congregation laughs)

570
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,340
 It's the, my mind's telling me no, but my body,

571
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,260
 that thing that comes alive in you

572
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,060
 as a young man and young woman, yes, okay, you all know.

573
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,740
 And some of you might be thinking,

574
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:55,740
 well, if God gave us sexual urges and sexual desires,

575
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,340
 why would we not be able to explore them?

576
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,780
 Why would we not to be able to entertain them,

577
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:07,780
 pleasure ourselves, find out more about who we are sexually?

578
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,260
 Something I've learned about us is

579
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,160
 when it comes to sexual sin, especially,

580
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,380
 we are never more creative as individuals

581
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,820
 until we're justifying sin.

582
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:20,700
 We're never more creative till we're justifying sin.

583
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,700
 And so you get the urge and you're like,

584
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,620
 well, I won't go all the way.

585
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,420
 Well, we'll just do this.

586
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,300
 Well, I'll just watch, and I won't actually do anything,

587
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,900
 I'll just watch.

588
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,220
 Or it's just, it used to be full on videos,

589
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,420
 now it's just images and it's not that big of a deal.

590
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,020
 It's not that big of a deal.

591
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,960
 It's not that big of a deal.

592
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,740
 And instead of resisting the urge,

593
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,180
 you feed it like David did.

594
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,220
 He could have turned away, but he fed it.

595
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,100
 It says he went and he inquired more.

596
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,820
 This is like the modern day,

597
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,460
 you're scrolling on Instagram and a picture pops up

598
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,500
 on your explore page or something,

599
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,460
 and it's a girl in a bikini or a guy

600
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,140
 doing some shirtless thirst trap thing.

601
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,500
 You could have kept scrolling.

602
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,460
 You could have got off.

603
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,980
 You could have done anything else, but what'd you do?

604
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,980
 Click.

605
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:11,140
 You went and inquired about this lady or about this man.

606
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,740
 And you went to their profile,

607
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,820
 you saw more bikini pictures that you liked,

608
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,400
 that got you sexually aroused, the urge came.

609
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,240
 Now what do you know?

610
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,220
 Oh my gosh, how is my laptop in my lap?

611
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,380
 I'm just watching YouTube videos.

612
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,020
 Oh, I guess I'll type in the website.

613
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,660
 Oh, I'm at this porn website.

614
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,280
 And then you're guilty because you looked at porn again.

615
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,640
 And you're going, how did I get here?

616
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,180
 Well, if you trace it back in that moment,

617
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:39,180
 you had a decision, get off, resist the urge or feed it.

618
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,740
 And if you continue to feed it,

619
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,220
 it will only get more and more hungry

620
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,100
 and it will lead you down a path to destruction.

621
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,820
 That's what we see in David's life.

622
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:54,380
 He could have walked away, but he inquired about the woman.

623
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,980
 And it says the woman was very beautiful.

624
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,200
 I wanna say something with care and compassion.

625
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,240
 I just, while I was reading this,

626
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,920
 I kind of got just an excuse I hear a lot

627
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,920
 from young adults after they fall sexually

628
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,920
 with someone else.

629
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,920
 Guys will oftentimes, well, bro,

630
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,520
 she was giving me all the signals.

631
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,700
 We did it because the way she was texting me,

632
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,500
 she came onto me, she, she, she.

633
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,240
 And I wanna say to my brothers,

634
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,700
 quit blaming women for your lack of self-control.

635
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,120
 You are the leader.

636
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,540
 You are in control of what you do.

637
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,340
 You need to own up for your actions.

638
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:43,360
 Ladies, well, he begged and he was so sweet.

639
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,840
 He texted me all these sweet things

640
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,000
 and we were emotionally connecting.

641
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,420
 He told me about his parents' divorce

642
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,680
 and he never shares that.

643
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,100
 (congregation laughing)

644
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:57,460
 To you, with compassion and care, I say,

645
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,460
 quit blaming men for your lack of self-worth.

646
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,960
 You deserve more.

647
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,560
 You are worth a man who will see you as God's daughter,

648
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,460
 as royalty, as chosen, as his own possession,

649
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,840
 and treat you accordingly.

650
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,400
 Last person I wanna speak to, to the abused.

651
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,900
 To the person who says,

652
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,620
 "Hey, there wasn't actually anything I could do."

653
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,820
 That's part of my story.

654
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,280
 And to you, I wanna say, it is not your fault.

655
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,460
 It is not your fault.

656
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,700
 You are not marked by that.

657
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,980
 A lot of you wrote down sexual abuse in this bucket,

658
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,800
 and that does not have to define who you are,

659
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,100
 but it also does not have to define your future decisions.

660
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,100
 Just because you were hurt

661
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,700
 does not mean you have to keep hurting yourself.

662
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,760
 I had to wake up and take actions for my own choices

663
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,700
 and say, "I have a choice.

664
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,980
 "I can keep blaming this moment

665
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,540
 "and continue to let it reproduce more and more hurt

666
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,760
 "in my life and in others,

667
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,460
 "or I can take responsibility for who I am in Christ."

668
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,360
 And you can too, in Christ, you can.

669
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,500
 But don't do it alone.

670
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:06,420
 All of us, we are called to resist the urge.

671
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,400
 And you might be thinking,

672
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,480
 "JD, you don't understand my sex drive, bro.

673
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,580
 "You don't understand my urge.

674
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,240
 "I got passions, I got feelings.

675
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,360
 "I can't stop.

676
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,460
 "It's all I think about.

677
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,480
 "It's all I see.

678
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,600
 "It's everywhere.

679
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,240
 "I best get to lock myself in my room

680
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,280
 "if I don't want to get the urge."

681
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:29,280
 And I would say to you, you're being ripped off.

682
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,780
 You're being lied to.

683
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:35,160
 This verse, I remember when I was single

684
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,060
 and fighting sexual sin and thinking,

685
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:41,320
 "I cannot stop doing this.

686
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,020
 "I cannot break free.

687
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,880
 "This is just so, I'm addicted to this.

688
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,640
 "What do I do?"

689
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,880
 And I read this.

690
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,180
 First Corinthians 10, 13, it says,

691
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,740
 "No temptation has overtaken you

692
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,680
 "that is not common to man."

693
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,460
 The first thing we see is your sin is not unique to you.

694
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:04,480
 You are not alone in what you are facing.

695
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,800
 You are not the only one with this raging sex drive

696
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,920
 or this urge that you were called to rein in

697
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,540
 and to do according to God's design.

698
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,740
 It's not unique to you.

699
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,040
 Where you are faithless, look what it says.

700
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,500
 "God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted

701
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,520
 "beyond your ability, but with the temptation,

702
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,460
 "he will also provide the way of escape

703
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,340
 "that you may be able to endure it."

704
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,420
 That's crazy.

705
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,360
 God is faithful.

706
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,400
 Left to myself, left to yourself,

707
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,420
 you're like, "Bro, I can't.

708
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,440
 "I can't resist the urge.

709
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,740
 "I can't, I can't."

710
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,600
 I'm like, "I can't, I can't."

711
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,740
 That's correct.

712
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,700
 You cannot, but God can.

713
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,240
 Jesus in you can.

714
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,600
 The power of the Holy Spirit in you can

715
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,320
 because God is faithful.

716
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,980
 Left to ourself, we are faithless.

717
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,120
 That's why we run to porn.

718
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,200
 That's why we run to sex, but God is faithful.

719
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,380
 How is he faithful?

720
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,220
 To give you the strength to endure it

721
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:07,400
 according to his spirit and to give you a way out.

722
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,020
 That means that if you find yourself with sexual temptation

723
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,160
 or an opportunity to choose your sin,

724
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,140
 God has already determined that you are strong enough

725
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,860
 to say no to that and yes to him.

726
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,940
 That's what that says to me.

727
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,780
 You have the strength because of Jesus in you

728
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,940
 to say no, to resist.

729
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,820
 I think what we have to be honest with ourself is

730
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,000
 is we like our sin.

731
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,900
 We like our sex.

732
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,240
 We like our porn.

733
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:39,720
 We need a faithful God to help our faithless flesh.

734
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,420
 We have to wake up every day and say, God, I need you.

735
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,940
 I need you to give me the strength

736
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,240
 and to show me the way out.

737
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,060
 And God is faithful to do it.

738
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,180
 You will have to yourself cannot resist the urge,

739
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,380
 but he in you, greater is he who is in you

740
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,980
 than he who is in the world.

741
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,820
 He can.

742
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,840
 He will.

743
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,700
 He will.

744
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,000
 For David, he provided a way of escape.

745
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,340
 Look at this.

746
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,800
 He went and inquired about the woman.

747
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,620
 And then one said, is not this Bathsheba,

748
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,640
 the daughter of Elion, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?

749
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,560
 Basically he's saying, yo, bro, wake up, red flag.

750
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,020
 This woman, she's someone's daughter

751
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,620
 and she's someone's wife.

752
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,880
 I don't see King David anywhere written on this woman.

753
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,900
 She is not yours.

754
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,620
 What to say?

755
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,740
 So David sent messengers and took her.

756
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,500
 He didn't listen, but God provided the way of escape

757
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,740
 through community, which is step four,

758
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,380
 run from sin and towards community.

759
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,920
 But actually listen to them.

760
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,780
 Don't do what David did.

761
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,940
 He had one of his boys being like,

762
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,160
 hey, King, I don't think that woman is for you

763
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,060
 to have sex with.

764
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,980
 And he said, go and get her.

765
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,820
 I want what I want.

766
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,680
 I want what I want.

767
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,780
 Do what I want.

768
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,740
 And I think this is why a lot of us have problems

769
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,920
 letting people speak into our dating decisions

770
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,240
 or who we date or how we date.

771
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,740
 This is why we don't like people telling us

772
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,260
 that we should probably get off social media

773
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,940
 because it's causing anxiety or us falling to sexual sin.

774
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,340
 This is probably why we don't like people saying,

775
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,100
 hey, you shouldn't live alone,

776
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,780
 or hey, you should move to Dallas

777
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,200
 to get around more community.

778
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,340
 We actually don't like running to community because why?

779
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,260
 We go to people to get validated, not corrected.

780
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,620
 We want people to simply validate

781
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,380
 what we've already decided we're going to do.

782
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,260
 We like people who will say, whatever makes you happy.

783
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,020
 Because that's what the world does.

784
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,580
 We want people who are gonna pat us on the back

785
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,600
 and tell us everything we want to hear.

786
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,180
 But that's not what you need.

787
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,480
 You need this guy in your life.

788
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,220
 You need people who will lovingly seek to challenge

789
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,620
 and correct you with compassion and care

790
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,100
 because they love you

791
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,320
 and they have your best interests in mind.

792
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,660
 That's the kind of people you need around you.

793
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,020
 You need soldiers in the battle with you.

794
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:26,420
 A man who goes to war by himself is sure to fall,

795
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,140
 but there is strength in numbers.

796
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,500
 There is strength in the pack.

797
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,240
 It's he who is isolated

798
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,480
 that the prowling lion seeks to devour.

799
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,880
 He knows if I can get them alone,

800
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,760
 that is when I can attack.

801
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,600
 You've all seen National Geographic.

802
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,240
 And now the wolves wait for the baby gazelle

803
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,880
 to get just far enough away from its mother and attack.

804
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,880
 Or now the lions wait for the sick elephant or something

805
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,820
 and attack.

806
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,160
 The Bible says that the enemy is like a roaring lion

807
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,940
 seeking someone to devour.

808
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,140
 He is prowling, waiting for the person

809
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,740
 who would rather run to their sin than to their community.

810
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,780
 And that's when he attacks.

811
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,580
 He who is alone is sure to fall.

812
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,940
 I think about all those videos back in the day

813
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,500
 where people are soldiers even today in war movies

814
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,460
 when they're back to back with their guns.

815
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,060
 Like, got my six.

816
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,100
 They're going all around like this.

817
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,660
 We need that.

818
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,700
 We need people who will recognize our blind spots

819
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,320
 that we can't see.

820
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,360
 We need people who will see our patterns and go,

821
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,840
 hey, hey, every time you go out with them,

822
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,040
 you gotta get a call the next morning.

823
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,160
 Is this a good idea?

824
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,040
 Hey, I haven't heard about your prayer life

825
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,320
 or your time in God's word, what's going on.

826
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,000
 But instead, we want people who will simply validate us,

827
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,200
 not correct and challenge us.

828
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,600
 And the result, we run to sin and not towards the Lord.

829
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,700
 We have to do what it takes to fight sin

830
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,200
 because sin will fight us.

831
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,340
 We have to do what it takes to make war against sin

832
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,620
 because there's a war coming for us.

833
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,400
 Ephesians six tells us that we don't battle

834
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,860
 against flesh and blood.

835
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,720
 We battle against a cosmic force,

836
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,360
 a dark power who is coming to steal, kill, and destroy

837
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,460
 and take your life.

838
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,320
 And oftentimes how he does that is how he did it with David

839
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,020
 through one decision.

840
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,600
 It was just one decision.

841
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,840
 You maybe have done it so many times,

842
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,520
 but this one time you got caught

843
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,200
 or this one time they got pregnant

844
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,480
 or this one time it led to an abortion that hurt,

845
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,040
 this one time it led to abuse

846
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,640
 and it went further than you ever thought it would.

847
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,800
 I don't know what it was for you,

848
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,400
 but you were convinced on the front end,

849
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,840
 it was minimized and you were told,

850
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,000
 hey, it's just one sin, it's just one thing,

851
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,960
 don't worry about it.

852
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,300
 And on the back end, it caused so much destruction.

853
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:54,120
 That's why we must run to community when we battle sin.

854
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,640
 You can not battle alone.

855
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,440
 I wanna close with this.

856
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,720
 Why does this matter?

857
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,960
 Some of you might think right now this is just ridiculous.

858
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,340
 Another Christian guy telling you it's just

859
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,760
 to stop having sex and to save yourself

860
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,800
 and all these different things.

861
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,160
 And you're like, man, this is so dated

862
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,460
 and this is so irrelevant.

863
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,640
 Why are y'all so passionate about this?

864
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,960
 Why do y'all talk about porn all the time

865
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,660
 and hookup culture and all these things all the time?

866
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,960
 That bucket's full of it.

867
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,880
 Of people acknowledging, man, this brings so much hurt,

868
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,260
 so much hurt.

869
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,620
 Like it did David.

870
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,520
 He didn't just get her pregnant.

871
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,840
 If you know the story, after that moment,

872
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,680
 he has to go on and take Uriah, her husband,

873
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,160
 off the battlefield, so now his sin is affecting

874
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,280
 his fellow soldier, it's affecting,

875
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,760
 your sin affects more people than just you.

876
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,000
 Like it did Uriah, he takes him off the battleground

877
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 and he says, hey, get drunk and sleep with your wife

878
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,240
 'cause he's trying to hide up the fact

879
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,000
 that he slept with his wife.

880
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,320
 But Uriah's a man of integrity and he won't sleep

881
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,820
 with his wife because his boys are back at battle.

882
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,640
 He says it's not right.

883
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,800
 And so David ends up having to send Uriah

884
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,680
 to the front lines of the war to be killed

885
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,320
 to cover up his sin.

886
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,000
 It was so much more than just a decision.

887
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,400
 It was so much more than just a one-night stand

888
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,600
 because after this, the baby ended up not even living.

889
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,320
 And as you read the rest of the life of a man

890
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,200
 who was a man after God's own heart,

891
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,280
 who was marked by courageous faith,

892
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,680
 you see that the rest of his life,

893
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,180
 David was just never the same.

894
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:39,460
 He walked with a limp the rest of his life.

895
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:44,000
 And although his sin did not define him

896
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,600
 like we learned last week, his sin did not define him.

897
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,600
 However, it brought a lot of unnecessary pain

898
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,600
 and consequences on his life.

899
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:01,920
 Your sin today as a single young adult,

900
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,980
 six months into marriage, as a single young adult,

901
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:10,280
 your decisions today are affecting your marriage

902
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,540
 if that's what God has for you.

903
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,560
 It's affecting your parenting

904
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,800
 if that's what God has for you.

905
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,840
 It's affecting your future generation

906
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,340
 of grandkids and grandkids.

907
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,200
 The decisions you make today matter.

908
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,160
 One of the ways that mine have been affected,

909
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,520
 when I, one of the reasons why I was so afraid to get married

910
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,880
 is because my past is just riddled

911
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,880
 with sexual brokenness and sexual sin.

912
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,480
 And one of the reasons why I was always afraid

913
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,520
 to speak on stage is 'cause I never wanted

914
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,760
 to tell anyone about that.

915
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,300
 So I always thought, well, if I speak on stage,

916
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,840
 I'm gonna be a fraud.

917
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,800
 And it wasn't until finally I opened up for the first time

918
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,560
 and I began to experience freedom from shame and guilt

919
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,120
 from my past and learning that Jesus came down

920
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,240
 and died a sinner's death on a cross

921
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,440
 and he hung my sexual sin to the cross.

922
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,200
 And he was buried in a grave, in a tomb.

923
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,280
 He rose again.

924
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,280
 He brought victory over my sin.

925
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,760
 And because of that, the old passed away

926
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,980
 and I was a brand new man.

927
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:19,480
 But even still, riddled with reminders of my past,

928
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,320
 afraid to be known, especially by a woman.

929
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,920
 When I met Jenna, my now wife, I was like,

930
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,440
 oh my gosh, I am so afraid 'cause I'm really into this girl.

931
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,080
 And if you've actually ever been vulnerable

932
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,160
 with someone that you really care about,

933
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,280
 it's so scary because you're like,

934
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,280
 man, I'm gonna give this piece of myself to you

935
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,720
 and you could like really mess me up.

936
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,760
 Like you could break up with me

937
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,720
 and like, that's gonna really hurt.

938
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,040
 And so I remember when we were dating,

939
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,200
 I was like, all right, I'm gonna tell her about all my past

940
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,200
 and see how she responds because if she can't accept

941
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,680
 like what Jesus has done in my life and change,

942
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,200
 like I can't marry this girl.

943
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,580
 Like I have to marry someone who sees me as new,

944
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,420
 but what if she doesn't?

945
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,360
 I really like her.

946
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,200
 I shouldn't tell her?

947
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,160
 No, I shouldn't.

948
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:13,000
 Going back and forth, I remember being so nervous

949
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,200
 and we sat down for dinner and I could like barely eat.

950
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,880
 I don't think I ate a bite actually.

951
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,580
 And I sat down and I was like, okay, I just gotta talk.

952
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:27,260
 And I began to let her in to all of my past

953
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,400
 and my sexual sins and struggles and brokenness.

954
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,000
 And she's listening and she's listening, she's nodding.

955
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,320
 And I'm like, oh my gosh, what's she about to say?

956
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,700
 And I finished tears streaming down my face saying,

957
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,880
 this is me.

958
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,360
 I'm new in Christ, but this is all of me.

959
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,860
 And she looked at me and she said something

960
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,000
 I'll never forget.

961
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 She said, thank you for trusting me with who you were.

962
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,280
 I'm not really worried about that man.

963
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,080
 What I wanna know is who is the man

964
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,520
 sitting across from me today?

965
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:12,860
 And what does this stuff look like to this man today?

966
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,240
 And it was like, wow.

967
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,520
 And why did it feel like that?

968
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,360
 Because in that moment I felt free.

969
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,640
 Because I'm like, who I am today is not a man

970
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,200
 who's defined by his sexual sin.

971
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,380
 And the last step to battling sin is to respond rightly.

972
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,120
 Respond rightly.

973
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:41,160
 When you fall, when you are tempted,

974
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,520
 your proper response is to run to the cross.

975
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,320
 For it is sufficient to meet your every need.

976
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,720
 Whether you're tempted by sin

977
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,360
 or whether you have given in to sin,

978
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,120
 the cross is your solution.

979
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,800
 And I think the reason why I was so afraid

980
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,160
 to bring my sin to Jinnah was because deep down

981
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,840
 there's something in me that's still afraid

982
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,680
 of my sin with God.

983
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,000
 I come before him and I confess what I've messed up

984
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,280
 or what I've looked at or what I've done.

985
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,220
 And I'm thinking, what's he thinking?

986
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,060
 What's he thinking?

987
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,000
 What's he thinking?

988
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,040
 And just like Jinnah reminded me of the gospel,

989
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,520
 hey, thank you for informing me of the old man.

990
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,980
 Who's the new man that I'll be dating?

991
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:24,440
 God is saying to you tonight, hey, that's who you were,

992
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,560
 but that's not who I see.

993
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,040
 That's not who you are.

994
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:32,280
 Therefore, remember who you are and what you're called to do.

995
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,640
 Recognize where you're susceptible.

996
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,080
 Resist the urge and choose me.

997
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:43,120
 And in the face of temptation, run to community

998
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,000
 and respond rightly.

999
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,360
 And if you do, watch how your battle

1000
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,120
 against sexual sin will change.

1001
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,720
 God is not done with you.

1002
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,400
 God is not done with us.

1003
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,360
 God wants to rewrite sexuality

1004
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,800
 and all of these things with this generation

1005
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,120
 who wanna trust him with his design, starting with us.

1006
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,320
 In this room, I believe it.

1007
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,080
 I believe if we do this again next year,

1008
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,400
 we can see things change,

1009
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,600
 but you've gotta be willing to fight the battle well.

1010
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,960
 And if you do, it'll affect everything.

1011
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,160
 It'll change everything.

1012
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,360
 If you'll trust God with this,

1013
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,000
 it'll change everything about your future marriage,

1014
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,680
 your future singleness, your future parenting,

1015
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,120
 all of these things.

1016
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:32,440
 But it has to start with the right response,

1017
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,000
 coming to him, trusting him with wherever you're at

1018
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,960
 on the spectrum of this message.

1019
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,360
 I pray you will.

1020
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,200
 Let's pray.

1021
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:47,040
 God, this is heavy.

1022
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,240
 And sometimes it can feel like,

1023
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,200
 man, we don't even know where to begin.

1024
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,280
 And so I just pray right now, spirit,

1025
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,280
 that you would come and you would meet

1026
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,080
 every need of the person in the room.

1027
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,480
 For the person who is feeling bound

1028
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,120
 by something sexual tonight,

1029
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,880
 would you just show them which part of the process

1030
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,720
 you want them to take?

1031
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,560
 And it might just be to respond to you,

1032
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,480
 to your grace and to your kindness and to your mercy

1033
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,200
 that is readily available to them.

1034
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,400
 If it's a person going,

1035
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,560
 man, in the face of sexual urges and desires,

1036
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,280
 I've ran to my sin and not from it.

1037
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,400
 Would you give them the strength?

1038
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,360
 Would you show them that you are ready to resist?

1039
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,680
 God, I don't know.

1040
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,640
 You just, you know.

1041
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,440
 You know everything going on in this room.

1042
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,480
 And I pray right now,

1043
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,720
 if there's anyone feeling condemnation,

1044
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,920
 if there's anyone feeling like you're angry,

1045
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,480
 would they feel your gentleness in this song?

1046
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,600
 Would they feel your desire

1047
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,760
 not to go and perform differently,

1048
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,760
 but to remember whose they are in you

1049
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,320
 and the calling that they have on their life

1050
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,720
 because of what you've done?

1051
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,400
 Because we are free,

1052
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,440
 because our sexual sin doesn't define us,

1053
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,000
 we respond now in worship.

1054
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,960
 It's in your name that I pray, amen.
