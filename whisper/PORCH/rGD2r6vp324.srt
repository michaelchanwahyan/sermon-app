1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 And so my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 [Music]

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Hey, welcome friends everywhere, wherever you're tuning in from, El Paso, Fayetteville, Houston, Fort Worth.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Get excited, we are continuing this series, Divided States of America, week two,

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 as we are launching into just a conversation around some key issues and divisive issues in our country.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 And what's a Christian perspective and how do we think about these things and what's the appropriate biblical lens to think through.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 And so let me start by framing up our time together by a little bit of a story.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Before we started Awaken Conference, we used to do something called Launch Retreat.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Launch Retreat, get excited, was out at a camp, Sky Ranch, Van, Texas, and every year we'd have a different theme,

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 thousand young adults, party by the lake, really fun weekend.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 One year our theme was party in the USA. Launch, party in the USA.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And so we went through just the nines on, hey, we've got to have decked out, America, USA, all this different, you know, gear, decorations, everything.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 And what else do you need to have if your theme for a huge party at a weekend is party in the USA?

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 That's right, a bald eagle.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 So I thought, how do you find a bald eagle?

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Turns out they're not as easy as you would think, but that didn't stop me.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I'm not a quitter, I'm an American, party in the USA.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 So I decided, man, we're going to go full tilt all about getting a bald eagle.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Called up a bunch of different places and they were like, yeah, that'll be 50 grand.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 It was like, okay, that's not happening.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And then I was told as I was calling someone that there was a wildlife preservation group in East Texas near the retreat location that had recently rescued,

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 that's right, a bald eagle.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 So I got a hold of their phone number, called them up, explained, yes, I'm a pastor, but I'd like to see your eagle.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 And walked through that and the guy was like, I can't bring you the bald eagle.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 In order for us to do anything with it, even for us to go rescue it, we had to get a permit from the United States government.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Because these are such restricted, protected animals that you can't even approach one, you can't go up to one, you can't touch one,

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 even if you're out in the wild, without risking getting a fine.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 In other words, if you're walking along and out in the, you know, you're camping one day in the wilderness,

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 you stumble upon a bald eagle nest, if you decide, man, I'm going to take a selfie right here with this bald eagle,

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 the government, if they find that selfie, is going to fine you and fine you up to $250,000 and five years in prison.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Think about that.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Now, this has actually happened.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 People have actually gone to prison for messing with a bald eagle egg or a bald eagle nest.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Can you think about that?

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Can you imagine being in prison?

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Everyone's going around, out to lunch, you know, trays and telling about what they're in for.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And yeah, I robbed a bank, I knocked a guy off.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And the other guy's like, yeah, I took a selfie with a bald eagle egg and now I'm in prison.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 How bad is that story?

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Well, how did that law get passed?

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 There was a group that decided, hey, we think that because it's an endangered species,

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 we need to pass legislation and advocate and raise our voice and have elected officials pass laws that protect bald eagles and bald eagle eggs.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 What does that have to do with what we're talking about tonight?

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Tonight, we're going to move into a divisive topic in our country that is related to the protection of rights on both sides.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 In other words, a divisive issue in our country right now is around the conversation or the issue of abortion or pro-life and pro-choice.

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 The rights of the unborn versus the rights of the woman.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 And let me say up front, because immediately, even saying that word, I just know it's such a loaded term.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Some of you, even the word abortion, you're flooded with shame, guilt, and condemnation.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And I want to make abundantly clear, those emotions are not from the Lord.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 If you were a Christian, that doesn't define you.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 No sin is greater in terms of the fact that all sin and all of us, any sin in our life, require the death of Jesus.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 So if in the next little bit you feel any amount of shame and condemnation and any of that beating over the head, that's not where we're going.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And that is not from the Lord. That is from Satan.

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Additionally, the term triggers a bunch of people going, "Hey, you guys don't talk nearly enough about this issue."

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And so we're going to venture into a tricky topic and just talk through what does it look like to be pro-life versus pro-choice

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 or pro-the rights of the unborn and some would say pro-the rights of the woman.

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 And the reason I say it's tricky is there's a lot of energy around this issue, and Christians will have a lot of energy around this issue.

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And you'll be not cool with abortion, but you're totally cool with sleeping with your girlfriend.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And you know that's what leads to an unborn pregnancy, right?

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And so just as we move into this conversation, I want us to look through the lens of what does God's Word say about this topic.

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 How should we respond and how do we just stay informed and how do we be advocates for life, period?

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 So we're going to walk through three ideas as it relates to this topic, three questions.

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And the first one is around when does life start?

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 There's a common terminology or phrase that's out there that, hey, it's just a clump of cells up to a certain point.

65
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 So we're going to just talk through and begin the discussion and evaluate when does life start?

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Like when does it move from being an embryo or something more into actually a human life?

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 It's a crucial question to begin to ask.

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Before I go into that, I want to invite to the stage a couple of friends of mine.

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Hold on before they come. This is Lauren and Jordan.

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Lauren and Jordan are 20 weeks pregnant.

71
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 They have not had a sonogram because of COVID.

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 They are about to have their very first sonogram, find out what their baby looks like on the stage right now.

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 So you guys can come up. And they're with Farrah and Meredith from Thrive. Thrive is a ministry that helps just unplanned pregnancies and couples that are walking through that and women that are walking through that.

74
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 They're going to be getting ready and I'm going to walk through and we'll keep talking over here, but they're going to be getting ready.

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 But this is Lauren and Jordan. And they, how exciting is this?

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Are about to see their baby for the very first time. Goosebumps.

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 You got your money's worth.

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 But while they're getting all set up, I want to walk through and let's just talk about when does life begin?

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Is it just a clump of cells? Is it just a clump of cells?

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Right. So that's the first question I want to walk through as they're getting ready.

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 According to Princeton University, at conception, a baby's sex, hair color, eye color, essentially all of its DNA are present from the very moment of conception.

82
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 In fact, further studies have shown that at the moment of conception, sperm, egg, meat, there's a flash of light.

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 And from that moment, all of the baby's unique DNA, hair color, eye color, everything is fixed for the rest of their life.

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 According to the Mayo Clinic, in the first trimester, first 13 weeks, the baby's toes, fingernails, nose, head, hormones, and heart begin to beat.

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 21 days after conception, you can detect the heartbeat of the baby.

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 It will beat 54 million times between now and when it's born.

87
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And you can detect the heartbeat. At six weeks, you can detect brainwaves that are functioning inside of the child's brain.

88
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 At eight weeks into pregnancy, the baby will begin to express through touching.

89
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 It will be squinting, jaw movement, grasping motions, thumb sucking.

90
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 At eight weeks end, toe pointing and can even smile at you.

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 This is just from secular biologies. This is what we know in terms of research.

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 At nine weeks, the baby has fully developed its own set of fingerprints.

93
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 A doctor around this time can identify the sex of the baby.

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 And the baby's even now producing its own reproductive cells.

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 If it's a girl, she's already developing her uterus and ovaries that will have the eggs that will carry or have the children.

96
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 That if she has children, will be there for the rest of her life.

97
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 By the end of the first trimester, the fetus has every organ.

98
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Fetus, by the way, is a word that we think means something. It means offspring. It's a Latin word for offspring.

99
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 At the end of the first trimester, it has every organ it will have throughout its entire life.

100
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 At 12 weeks, the baby can actually cry in the womb.

101
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 At week 13, it can feel pain.

102
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And will try to move away from any procedures or doctors or anything that is happening as people move in.

103
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Whether that's an abortion or another procedure.

104
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 95% of biologists in America believe that life begins at conception.

105
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 So just as we're talking about this, just what biology says. I'm not saying it's what you have to believe.

106
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 It's just what biology is pointing out what they believe.

107
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 How's it going back there, guys?

108
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Awesome.

109
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Yeah?

110
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 They just saw it's a baby girl.

111
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Oh, they just saw it's a baby girl.

112
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Let's go on, ladies!

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 [Applause]

114
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 You tell me whenever you're ready.

115
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Yeah, we're ready.

116
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Are you ready?

117
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Sure.

118
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Man, let's do this. Get the popcorn ready. Come on.

119
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Oh, there.

120
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Oh.

121
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 So what are we looking at?

122
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Oh, my goodness.

123
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 So is that her head?

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 I'm not really an expert in this.

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Heartbeat. This is the baby's heartbeat.

126
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Go ahead.

127
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 It's the heartbeat.

128
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 20 weeks old.

129
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And that heart has been beating since it was three weeks old.

130
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Come on.

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And as you move it around, for those of us -- for them,

132
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 who can't understand what it is, what are we looking --

133
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 So what we're looking at right now, this is the baby's face.

134
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 So Farrah's going to point up.

135
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Yep, that's the baby's nose.

136
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 There's the baby's eyes right there.

137
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 You'll see the stomach is a little round circle.

138
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 So babies swallow the amniotic fluid.

139
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 So it's important for us to see that stomach right there.

140
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 And that happens in the first trimester, nine to ten weeks.

141
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Wow.

142
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Baby's feet.

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 So baby's pretty much folded in half right now.

144
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 The legs are all the way up by the head.

145
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Oh, my goodness.

146
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 There's the feet.

147
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Are those your feet, Jordan?

148
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Huge.

149
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Huge.

150
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Definitely.

151
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 So as a baby girl, by 16 weeks, she has all of her ovaries --

152
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 I mean all of her eggs in her ovaries by 16 weeks.

153
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Wow.

154
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Yep.

155
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 So pretty amazing.

156
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And that's the heart beating.

157
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 That's the heart beating, yes.

158
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 It's amazing.

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Yeah, pretty amazing.

160
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 It's amazing.

161
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Let's do a 3D.

162
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Yeah, we're going to get to a 3D.

163
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 This machine is amazing.

164
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 So it shows moms when they come in for these sonograms.

165
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 It gives 3D and 4D images.

166
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 And I got to tell you, as great as sonogram machines are,

167
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 we see babies that are the size of a poppy seed.

168
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 So when a baby's heart is beating for the first time,

169
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 we can see that on sonogram, and it's the size of a poppy seed.

170
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 That's tiny.

171
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Remember when you get a hamburger and it's got the little poppy seeds?

172
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 That baby's heart's already beating.

173
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 It already has a spinal cord.

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 It's already got the hand and foot plates ready to form its hands and feet.

175
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 It's just amazing.

176
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 So this is a 3D, and it all depends on the direction the baby's pointing.

177
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 There's the nose and the eyes, little mouth right there.

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 How are you doing, Jordan?

179
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 I'm great.

180
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Yeah.

181
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 How are you doing, Mom?

182
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Good.

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Yeah.

184
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 So they'll get pictures of all this to take with them.

185
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 That is amazing.

186
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

187
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 So this is life.

188
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And so this is 20 weeks.

189
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 That's amazing.

190
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Man, hey, will you guys give it up to Thrive and Jordan and Laura?

191
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 [Applause]

192
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 You done?

193
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 We're going to talk about this is the age of --

194
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Yeah, you go.

195
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Yeah.

196
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 So I think one of the hard things right now to think about is this baby has all

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 of its organs.

198
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 It's fully developed.

199
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 It's now just going to grow until it's born.

200
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And this is the age that you can still have an abortion in Texas and most

201
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 states.

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 So all the way up to 21 weeks and six days can a mom have an abortion.

203
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And I think David's going to talk more about that later.

204
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 But just to kind of give that impact of what's going on in our culture and our

205
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 country today and kind of to speak to what you're talking about, what we're

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 voting for.

207
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Yeah.

208
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Man, well, thank you guys.

209
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Thank you all so much for being here.

210
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Amazing.

211
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 [Applause]

212
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Thank you, Lauren.

213
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 I feel like she has to be named the porch or something now.

214
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Oh, Meredith, that's right.

215
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Awesome.

216
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Hey, let me keep going.

217
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 I'm fighting every girl's attention on the foot up there I'm sure right now.

218
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 But I'm going to keep driving.

219
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 So that's what biology shows us.

220
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 But what does God's word say about this?

221
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 In Psalm 139, David writes and describes how God's relationship with him began

222
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 and where it began.

223
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And he says this in Psalm 139, verse 13 through 16.

224
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 God, you created my inmost being.

225
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 You knit me together in my mother's womb when I was that size.

226
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 I praise you because I'm fearfully and wonderfully made.

227
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Your works are wonderful and I know that full well.

228
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 My name was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place,

229
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 when I was woven together.

230
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Your eyes saw my unformed substance.

231
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came yet to be.

232
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 David says God was weaving him together like he wove you together, your personality,

233
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 your hair color, everything about you was being formed all in the womb.

234
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 You're extroverted because God formed you that way.

235
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 You're introverted because he formed you.

236
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 You have brown hair, not just because you dyed it,

237
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 God wove you together and he formed you in your mother's womb and fixed those things.

238
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Jeremiah chapter 1, verse 5 says that before I formed you in the womb, God to Jeremiah,

239
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.

240
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Before you were born, I set you apart.

241
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 In Exodus chapter 21, verse 22 through 25, it describes that if two men get into a fight

242
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 and they accidentally hit a pregnant woman and it does damage or takes the life of the baby,

243
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 the life of the person who did that action is required.

244
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 It says this, if two people are fighting and they hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely

245
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 and there's no injury, the offender must be fined whatever the husband demands and court allows.

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 But if there is serious injury and you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth,

247
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 hand for hand, foot for hood, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise,

248
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Exodus says it is a child in the womb.

249
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Even legally in the state of Texas.

250
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And again, listen to me very closely.

251
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 If you feel shame and condemnation, that is not the voice of the Lord.

252
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 I'll explain even more of that here in a second.

253
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 But if you're feeling those things, if you have trust in Christ, those don't define you

254
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 and you can be free from that and all of us are sinners.

255
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 And yet we have to have an important conversation about a really key issue.

256
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Even legally, we have crossed the threshold.

257
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Whereas a nation in 38 states, we inconsistently, while we allow that she could go drive right now and have an abortion,

258
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 if on the way to that abortion clinic, Jordan and her get in a wreck and are hit by a drunk driver

259
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 that's on the way there and it ends up killing Lauren and the baby,

260
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 legally, it would be a double homicide.

261
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Where even legally we go, yep, it's a life.

262
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 And we have crossed the threshold.

263
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 And the Bible and biology seem to be clear.

264
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Life begins at conception.

265
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 The second question that's often asked is, maybe not, well, is it a life or is it not a life or is it just a clump of cells?

266
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 It's not maybe a clump of cells, but it's still, it's in her body, it's her choice, so who am I to say anything about that?

267
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 So the argument goes, hey, it's my body, I get to do what I want with my body, it's my choice.

268
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Biblically, as Christians, I'm talking to Christians,

269
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 it's clear to passages like Exodus chapter 21 and even the fact of Genesis chapter 1 verse 27,

270
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 that is not just her body, there are two bodies, two DNAs, two blood types,

271
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 all wrapped up, two sets of fingerprints in her body.

272
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 It's not just her body, it's another human made in the image of God.

273
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Genesis chapter 1 verse 27 says, "In the beginning God created mankind in His image.

274
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 In His image God made them, male and female."

275
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 It is abundantly clear that it's not just her body in the womb.

276
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 I think one of the challenges, if you're wrestling with, well, you know, I'm not really sure where I stand on that,

277
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 I just want to give a few suggestions. Here's an acronym on just thinking through,

278
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 what does determine the life of the womb?

279
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Because some people are like, well, it's not really a person because it's way too small.

280
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 There's some threshold, and because it's too small, then it's not really a life.

281
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 To that, I would just say, what makes the life of someone smaller, less valuable, than someone bigger?

282
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I have a four-year-old son, two-year-old daughter.

283
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Four-year-old son, 38 inches tall, two-year-old daughter.

284
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 She's a strong 20. Is she less valuable than him?

285
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 No, that's crazy. And you're going, "No, that's silly."

286
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Well, just begin to back it up.

287
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 At what point does size determine someone's value?

288
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Or, level of development?

289
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Maybe you're going, "Well, they haven't developed, they haven't finished growing,

290
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 they're not able to have, you know, they're not fully formed, they don't have any teeth yet."

291
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 At what point does level of development determine someone's value?

292
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Is someone who hasn't gone through puberty less valuable and of less worth than someone who has?

293
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Because they've not developed as much.

294
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Or the argument of environment.

295
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 The, "Hey, the environment, because the child is in the womb of another person or of a mother,

296
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 that the environment determines that it's less valuable."

297
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 On what occasion would somebody rationally say,

298
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 "The environment in which someone is or exists determines how valuable they are."

299
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 If they're in the mountains versus on the beach,

300
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 what would determine, what significance does that have towards their value?

301
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Location and environment.

302
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Maybe the most common one is related to dependency or viability,

303
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 which is around 22 weeks.

304
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 So, right around this time.

305
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 But dependency, you're going, "Well, it's not, you know, it's still her choice, still her body,

306
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 she still gets to do so because, you know, who am I?

307
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 She's, the baby's entirely dependent on them."

308
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 The degree of dependency is crazy.

309
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 I just used my two-year-old daughter.

310
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 My two-year-old daughter, totally dependent on us.

311
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Can't open the fridge, can't give herself food to eat.

312
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 She is totally dependent on another human in her life.

313
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 You'd be going, "Yeah, but they're not like attached and totally in the womb."

314
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 A one-year-old baby is still entirely dependent on another human.

315
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 And if it's going to survive, it will require being dependent on someone else.

316
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Not just that.

317
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 When you start getting into the degrees of, "Hey, if you're dependent,

318
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 and the person you're dependent on gets to decide whether you live or die,

319
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 you are playing with some dangerous fire.

320
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 You're allowing people to say, 'Hey, well, that's a slippery slope towards,

321
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 you know, they're on a ventilator for their lungs.

322
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And technically, you know, I have the ability to decide whether or not

323
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 I want to have that ventilator plugged in.

324
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 I have the ability because, you know, I'm around them and they're dependent

325
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 on some other machine to decide whether or not they have the value

326
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 and are worthy of life."

327
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 I have a friend who tragically, his son got bacterial meningitis

328
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 when he was a year and a half years old.

329
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 He went from an incredibly blossoming, growing, smart young boy,

330
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 and he went into a coma and his brain fried for the rest of his life.

331
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 He's now six with the mental capacity of a one-year-old.

332
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 He may never speak.

333
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 He will live with his parents.

334
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Is his life less valuable because he's dependent than you?

335
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 You begin to play with some dangerous fire that has some things in common

336
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 with people that have done some of the most atrocious things in history.

337
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And then desirability, that would be the final one.

338
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 So SLED, if you went through all of that, of size, level of development,

339
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 environment, dependency, and desirability.

340
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Maybe the mom doesn't want it.

341
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Does that mean that it's not worthy or valuable of life

342
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 if someone doesn't desire it?

343
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 I mean, think about the reactions that people have to the same circumstance.

344
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 A friend calls you, they got pregnant, and you bust out in tears,

345
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 and they're crying in tears, and they're afraid,

346
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 and they're not sure what they're going to do.

347
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 And if I have the baby, it's social suicide.

348
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 I don't know what to do.

349
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 I'm looking for another option to take, and you're heartbroken with them.

350
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 That same friend, two years later, if they were married,

351
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 and they called you and they said, "We're pregnant.

352
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 You're going to be over there.

353
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 You're throwing balloons.

354
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 You're doing a gender reveal party.

355
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 You're going up to the belly talking to them like, 'Hey, big guy.'"

356
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Because the desirability we've bought determines

357
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 whether it's worthy of living or not.

358
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 The Bible says it is worthy of life because it is made in the image of God.

359
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Second idea of, "Hey, it's my body."

360
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Biblically, again, for Christians, the Bible says it's not your body.

361
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 It's God's body, and so is the body of the child.

362
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 1 Corinthians 6 says you are not your own.

363
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 You were bought with a price.

364
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Honor God with your body.

365
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 As Christians, this is an argument that we cannot embrace

366
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 or allow or tolerate.

367
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Again, if you're feeling condemnation that is not from the Lord,

368
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 it's from an enemy who wants you to feel shame and guilt.

369
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 As it relates to the idea of, "Hey, it's my body.

370
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 It's my choice."

371
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 As Christians, we advocate there are other choices that all of us can make.

372
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 And I know I'm talking about both guys and girls

373
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 and the pain involved from past experiences with abortion.

374
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 There's one in four girls that are involved.

375
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 There's one in four guys that are part of that as well.

376
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 But in terms of the choices that are promoted for the Christian faith,

377
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 there's a few of them.

378
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 One of them would be don't have sex outside of marriage.

379
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 We have so, through the sake of like, "You know, I'm just going to do whatever I want to do."

380
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 We have brought and taken sex outside of God's design,

381
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 which is in the context of marriage, to take place.

382
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Where sex is designed to take place in the context of marriage,

383
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 a lifelong commitment and covenant to one another,

384
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 so that when it leads to life, it leads to a celebration.

385
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 The other option would be,

386
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 option number two would be to give the baby up for adoption.

387
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Listen to me very closely.

388
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 For every one child, every one baby that is waiting to be adopted,

389
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 there are 36 families on a wait list.

390
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 There are people waiting to adopt that will wait years and years,

391
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 hoping to be picked by the birth mother.

392
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 And they'll wait years and they'll never be able to adopt.

393
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 For every 36 families, there's one child.

394
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 There is such a vast shortage of children or of babies waiting to be adopted.

395
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And if you make the decision and you end up finding yourself in that circumstance,

396
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 and it's hard and tragic, and I know it's so, so scary.

397
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 But many of you, those connected to Watermark,

398
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 and those that we just hear from all the time,

399
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 who have made that decision that I'm going to go through with this,

400
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 I'm going to give and make an adoption plan take place,

401
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 I am so proud of you.

402
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I am so proud of you.

403
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 You decided that I'm going to take, because of my conviction,

404
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 I'm not taking the easy road out, and I am going to let this child live.

405
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 And those of you who didn't, God is not done with you.

406
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 God loves you.

407
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Your sin is no grosser than mine or anyone else's.

408
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 But the second option of the choice involved could be to give it up for adoption.

409
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 The third would be to raise the child, to decide I'm going to raise the child in my home.

410
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 In 2018, Kylie Jenner uploaded a YouTube video called "To Our Daughter."

411
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 She had just found out, or she had just recently given birth to a baby

412
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 that she had had with the rapper Travis Scott.

413
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Inside of the video, she talks about her child, Stormi, that's about to be born.

414
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 And as we see Kylie go in for the ultrasound with her mother,

415
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 she hears the heartbeat, and her friend is in the background, and she says this.

416
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 "When you're 20 years old," which is how old Kylie was when she found out she was pregnant,

417
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 "you're just figuring out life. You don't know who you want, or you don't know what you want.

418
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 You're basically an indecisive teenager. You're just becoming an adult.

419
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 But there was one thing your mom knew, Stormi, that she wanted, and that was you."

420
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 In 2019, Kylie told Vogue magazine in Australia,

421
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 "I feel like having a daughter has made me love myself more, and I want to be an example for her."

422
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 The idea that, "Hey, it's my body. I can do whatever I want. It's my choice.

423
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And if you're a male or you're anything, you have no right,

424
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 or the government has no right to tell me what I can do and what I can't do."

425
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 The government tells all of us what we can do and can't do all the time.

426
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Think about that. There's certain things you can't do right now.

427
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Try it on for size and respond with, "Hey, it's my body, my choice."

428
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 In other words, leave these doors, go on the highway, take all your clothes off, and walk around naked.

429
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And when the police show up, say, "Hey, officer, it's my body, my choice."

430
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 See how that works. We live underneath the regulations of laws all the time.

431
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 There's tons of things that you can't do just because it's your body,

432
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 or I can't do because it's my body.

433
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 When it comes to this issue, the Bible is emphatically clear.

434
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 One of the lies, I think, that is attached to this is that abortion is an empowering thing to women.

435
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And if you want to be fighting for women's rights and fight for women,

436
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 you need to be at least open to and kind of see how they get there.

437
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 And I don't want to be against the girl squad, so don't come at me like that.

438
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 I am all for empowering women. I am married to a godly, strong woman.

439
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I am the son of an incredibly strong woman.

440
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 I have a daughter who I hope raises or she comes up and she is incredibly strong and empowered.

441
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Abortion does not empower women.

442
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 If anything, it empowers and allows society and men to get away with sexual irresponsibility,

443
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 taking advantage of women's bodies without any consequences that are there,

444
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 or just sexual indulgence on both sides.

445
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 And we have a culture that celebrates it.

446
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 In 2019, Michelle Williams stood up at the Golden Globes and she gave a speech.

447
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 We're receiving this golden statue, the Golden Globe. Here's what she said.

448
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 "I would not have been able to do this," won this award,

449
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 "without employing a woman's right to choose."

450
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 As she did, she said so to roaring applause in the audience.

451
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 If that is a life, I want you to think about what she just said.

452
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 To thunderous applause from a culture, how sad it is.

453
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 She essentially said, "I would not have been able to win this golden statue

454
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 had I not killed the growing child in my womb."

455
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 And we have a culture that applauds it.

456
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 And they will hate you and call you anti-woman and call you a misogynist or sexist,

457
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 even if you're a woman.

458
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 And you say, "I believe life starts at conception.

459
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 It may be a part of my story and abortion is part of my past,

460
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 but God is healing any of that, and I still, because God is clear on this,

461
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 I want to speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves."

462
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 And our culture sells the lie that this is empowering to women.

463
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 If anything, it is empowering to many gross men in society.

464
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 Harvey Weinstein loves abortion because it allows him to decide,

465
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 "Hey, I'm going to sleep around, do whatever I want,

466
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 and then just give her 500 bucks and get rid of it

467
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 and treat women like they're a mule."

468
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 The grossest men in society love abortion because they can abuse,

469
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 get away with things, and have no consequences.

470
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 And sadly, there's a feminist toxic strand of feminism

471
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 that empowers men like that through fighting for the decision.

472
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Empowering women's rights, what about the 50% of children aborted who are women?

473
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 When it comes to the idea of my body, it's my choice.

474
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Scripture is abundantly clear that is not the case.

475
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 In 2016, Mother Teresa--I'm sorry, this is in 1994--

476
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Mother Teresa was invited to the White House.

477
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Hillary Clinton was the president's wife.

478
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 And at the lunch that they had, Mother Teresa, she's a nun,

479
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 she was just a legend, and she came to the White House.

480
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 She's meeting with Hillary Clinton.

481
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Hillary Clinton asked her, "Hey, why do you think

482
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 that we haven't had a woman president yet?"

483
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Mother Teresa, so savage, doesn't miss a beat.

484
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 She says, "Probably because she was aborted."

485
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And she was saying, "We're ending the life of millions and millions of babies,

486
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 60 million since 1973."

487
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 That's more than Hitler, and World War II, Stalin.

488
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 And again, if you hear condemnation, listen to me as clearly as I can say it.

489
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 That is not the voice of the Lord.

490
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 I want to show you, when I talk about the choice that's being made,

491
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 an animation video of the most common way that abortion takes place.

492
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 It's a video that just displays the most common way.

493
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And I do this not to be over the top,

494
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 but it was through powerful images like Emmett Till in the 1950s,

495
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 and just don't even get lost there, but through seeing what's happening.

496
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 There's a reason why the concentration camps in Nazi Germany

497
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 were put outside of Germany,

498
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 because they didn't want the German people to see and know what was going on,

499
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 because they knew if they saw it, if they knew what was going on,

500
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 they would be okay with it.

501
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 And videos like the one we're about to see, that's less than a minute long,

502
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 have been basically outlawed in terms of public spaces,

503
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 because the more and more that people see it,

504
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 the more difficult it is to tolerate and be okay with what's taking place.

505
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 So, JJ, show the video.

506
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 The baby has a heartbeat, fingers, toes, arms, and legs,

507
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 but its bones are still weak and fragile.

508
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 The abortionist takes a suction catheter like this one.

509
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 This is a 14-french suction catheter.

510
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 It's clear plastic, about 9 inches long, and it has a hole through the center.

511
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 It is inserted through the cervix into the uterus.

512
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 The suction machine is then turned on

513
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 with a force 10 to 20 times more powerful than your household vacuum cleaner.

514
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 The baby is rapidly torn apart by the force of the suction

515
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 and squeezed through this tubing down into the suction machine,

516
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 followed by the placenta.

517
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Though the uterus is mostly emptied at this point,

518
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 one of the risks of a suction DNC is incomplete abortion.

519
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Essentially, pieces of the baby or placenta left behind.

520
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 This can lead to infection or bleeding.

521
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 In an attempt to prevent this, the abortionist uses a curette

522
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 to scrape a lining of the uterus.

523
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 A curette is basically a long, handled, curved blade.

524
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Once the uterus is empty, the spe--

525
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 That video was easily the most tame of the different trimester abortions that they have.

526
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 But it is happening every year,

527
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 and a million children will lose their life to that taking place.

528
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 So as it relates to, is it a life?

529
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 The Bible seems to be abundantly clear, even biology,

530
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 saying life begins at conception.

531
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 95% of biologists agree.

532
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 My body, my choice.

533
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 Is that a reasonable argument to allow--

534
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 And not just allow for abortion.

535
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 It has become a bandwagon,

536
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 and it has become something that is the issue for many people.

537
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 It's celebrated.

538
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 And it is a tragedy, and it is an affront to God.

539
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Finally, isn't abortion just the lesser of two evils?

540
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 I mean, yes, it's an unexpected pregnancy,

541
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 but why would you have another wrong by bringing a child into the world

542
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 when the circumstances that led to them being born was rape?

543
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Or why would you bring a child into the world when, you know,

544
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 it's such terrible circumstances, and his mom is on drugs,

545
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 and it's just a terrible upbringing, he'll have no father system,

546
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 will just end up being, you know, in prison someday.

547
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Why would you bring a child into that?

548
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Or you can't tell a woman to carry a child and give it up for adoption.

549
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 You know how emotionally taxing that is?

550
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 You know how emotionally painful it would be to ask a woman to go nine months

551
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 and then give a baby up for adoption?

552
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 It's social suicide. That's crazy.

553
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 The lesser of two evils, it's not great,

554
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 but abortion is the lesser of two evils, right?

555
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 I want to talk about some of these cases.

556
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 Let's talk about first the idea of rape.

557
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 Less than half of a percent of abortions that take place are related to rape.

558
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Rape is tragic.

559
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 If you're sexually abused, if it's a part of your story,

560
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 God didn't intend that, God can use that, it's not your fault.

561
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 You're not damaged goods.

562
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 And there are plenty of men and women who have that a part of their story,

563
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 and God is healing and using their story for good.

564
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 Less than half a percent of those who have an abortion are related to rape.

565
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 The vast, vast, vast majority are related to decisions like Michelle Williams had.

566
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 But even in those situations where a person does have rape that leads to conception,

567
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 the Bible would still say it's the taking of a life,

568
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 and if you're in that situation, we can walk alongside you.

569
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 We want to care for you.

570
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 We want to come and be there with you every step of the way.

571
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 We just don't think the death penalty should be given to the baby.

572
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 The rapist should be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,

573
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 and if anyone should get the death penalty, it's not the baby.

574
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 There's some friend of mine that is, you know,

575
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 when she was actually serving at the ports not long ago,

576
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 and during one of those situations, she ended up getting raped,

577
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 and she conceived and had a baby.

578
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 She made the decision to have that child,

579
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 and now that child attends on Sundays.

580
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 It goes to Sunday school, and she's six years old,

581
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 and she's coloring pictures of Jesus and Moses with other children in the class.

582
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 How tragic would it have been if in the course of people around her who said,

583
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 "Man, this is just not right. It's not your baby,"

584
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 or, you know, "Every time you see it, you're going to think about him."

585
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 She had made that decision, and now she's a beautiful girl

586
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 being raised by a godly father and godly mother.

587
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 She eventually ended up getting married,

588
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 has a little brother, and spends her Sundays in Sunday school at church

589
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 coloring pictures of Jesus because her mom made the decision.

590
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 It's a life.

591
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Some of these are such bad environments.

592
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 How could we even justify bringing them in?

593
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 I mean, the world is so broken already.

594
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 It's almost loving or kind or compassionate to not bring them into the world.

595
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 I mean, that's worse.

596
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Basically, when that argument is made, it's basically saying,

597
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 "Hey, some lives, they're not even worth living

598
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 because that would be such a bad circumstance to bring them up in."

599
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 One of these lives that was not worth living

600
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 was born to a woman whose first name--

601
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 I don't even have it on here.

602
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 But she had gotten pregnant, and she was basically addicted on drugs.

603
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 She had gotten pregnant.

604
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 She found herself in a relationship that was toxic,

605
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 and everyone in her life told her, "You should get the abortion."

606
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 She ended up moving in on government assistance

607
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 and finding herself in a home, and she carried through

608
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 and decided to have the child.

609
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 That woman's name or that woman's child is named Justin Bieber,

610
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 whose society would have said, "You're in a stinking home.

611
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 You're on government assistance.

612
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 The father was a drug addict, or there's clearly broken circumstances.

613
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 This is not a loving thing to do."

614
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 I'm not sure that life is worth bringing in.

615
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 I don't know Justin, but my guess is he would say,

616
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 "I'm sure glad my mom brought me into this world."

617
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 It's the idea of--and it's just too bad of an environment.

618
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Who are we to decide that?

619
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 Too emotionally traumatizing for the mother.

620
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 Let me move quickly.

621
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Hey, it's too emotionally traumatizing to ask a woman to go nine months

622
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 and to give the baby up for adoption.

623
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 I'm not invalidating.

624
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 That is a difficult, challenging, really hard decision to make.

625
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 And as the body of Christ, we want to come alongside.

626
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 We want to care for them.

627
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 We do everything we can to provide care for women,

628
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 and there's so many resources we'll point you to,

629
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 and then after this message.

630
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 But the trauma of walking through an abortion,

631
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 statistically studies show, is far greater than giving

632
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 and making an adoption plan and giving your child up for adoption.

633
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 In other words, the least loving thing you can do is encourage,

634
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 "Hey, you should have an abortion, not an adoption,"

635
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 because the mental health, the challenges that happen in life skyrocket.

636
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Here's what a study from CBS News found from the British Journal of Psychiatry

637
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 when it looked into abortion connection and mental health.

638
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 It found that women had an 81% increased risk of mental health

639
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 when it had abortion compared to adoption.

640
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 The study also found that women who had an abortion

641
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 were 110% more likely to abuse alcohol,

642
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 155% more likely to commit suicide.

643
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 It concludes, "Interestingly enough, this completely contradicts

644
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 "the pro-choice narrative that only if women get the abortion they want

645
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 "will they be able to live happy, fulfilled lives.

646
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 "Evidence points to the contrary.

647
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 "It is women who do not get the abortion but give them up for adoption

648
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 "who are more likely to lead healthy, happy lives."

649
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 Finally, there's a sentence that I think a lot of us fall into,

650
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 because as Christians, we're trying to love people,

651
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 we want to care for people, we want to be compassionate and empathetic

652
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 to really hard circumstances that I've never walked through

653
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 or you may never have walked through, and so sentences like this will be said,

654
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 like, "I wouldn't ever have one, but who am I to say

655
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 "that a woman didn't have this type of right?"

656
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 You don't know how hard it's been through

657
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 and everything that they're walking through,

658
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 and I don't, and who am I to impose my beliefs on them?

659
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 And I want to remove that sentence from your vocabulary,

660
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 not because your attempt in saying so is not from a heart of compassion

661
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 or a heart of care, I believe that it is.

662
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 I just believe that it is continuing to be silent

663
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 on an issue the Bible is emphatically clear on

664
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 and maybe the greatest moral blind spot in our country's history

665
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 and certainly the greatest blind spot today.

666
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 Doing so, saying that, you know, "I wouldn't, but who am I to say that?"

667
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 is essentially the Pontius Pilate argument.

668
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 Pontius Pilate, you guys know who Pilate is?

669
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 Pilate was the governor of the time, or the area where Jesus,

670
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 when he lived, hung out, walked on this earth,

671
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 he was the governor of that town,

672
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 the great, great state of Texas.

673
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 Pilate, Judea, and so Jesus was there, ends up getting arrested,

674
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 going to be crucified, pretty important, you know that part of the story.

675
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 He goes and he's put on trial.

676
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 Who is over the trial? Pilate, this Roman official.

677
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 Pilate goes, goes up to Jesus, these Jewish people are like,

678
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 "Yeah, he's crazy, you should kill him."

679
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 And Pilate's like, "All right, well, hey, they're saying you're crazy,

680
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 and should I kill you?"

681
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 And Jesus is like, "No, I've healed people,

682
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 and I've brought people back from the dead,"

683
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 and goes through his resume, and Pilate's like,

684
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 "He's a pretty stand-up guy, I'm not really sure that we should kill this guy."

685
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 But the Jews were like, "No, we've got to kill him, he claims to do something."

686
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 And Pilate makes an infamous decision.

687
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 He says, "I see no reason to crucify this man,

688
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 but I wash my hands of this thing."

689
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 Essentially what Pilate was saying was,

690
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 "I have reservations about whether to take Jesus' life.

691
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 I'm personally opposed to putting this man on a cross,

692
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 but who am I to impose my beliefs on others?

693
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 I'm not going to carry it out, that's my personal view,

694
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 but if others want to, they can."

695
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 As Christians, we are not to take that stance

696
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 when it relates to any issue of injustice, of life, of caring for people.

697
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Proverbs 31 says that you and I are called to speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves.

698
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 It says this in verse 8, "Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves,

699
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 for the rights of all who are destitute or in need.

700
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 Speak up and judge fairly, defend the rights of the poor and the needy."

701
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 And it says, "You are to speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves."

702
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 I don't know a single group in society

703
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 who cannot at all speak for themselves

704
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 to a greater degree than the unborn child.

705
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 And I know this is a tricky topic, and this is not a political thing,

706
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 this isn't a Republican thing, this is a Christian, it is a life.

707
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 And we are called to advocate for life,

708
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 and there's no group that is more at threat,

709
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 the number one killer of people in America today is abortion.

710
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 More than cancer, more than heart disease, abortion.

711
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 The parallels to times in the past where society,

712
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 because I know this is tricky and no one around us celebrates it,

713
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 and that's probably, those are some times where Christians,

714
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 despite the fact that society and culture is like,

715
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 "No, man, who are you? You have no right to say that,

716
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 and you stay out of this."

717
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 Those are often the times where Christians,

718
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 despite going against the culture, are in the right.

719
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 The parallels to the issue of slavery on this one are uncanny,

720
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 and before you tune out, I'm going to be very sensitive and very clear

721
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 on what I mean by that.

722
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 In 1860, there was a candidate by the name of Abraham Lincoln.

723
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 You guys know who he ran against?

724
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 A gentleman by the name of Stephen Douglas.

725
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 Stephen Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, they ran against each other.

726
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 They were debating each other for President of the United States.

727
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 The nation was on the threshold of war over the issue of slavery.

728
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 Both these two men ran.

729
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 They both had interesting platforms that they ran on.

730
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 Part of Stephen Douglas'--that's Lincoln's opponent.

731
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 You know what part of his thing was? Pro-choice.

732
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 Not around the issue of abortion. His thing was, "Hey, look,

733
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 I personally would not advocate for slavery."

734
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 You can go back and read the debates between Stephen Douglas,

735
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 just like we have debates, and the craziness that that is right now,

736
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 you can go read the debates of Lincoln and Douglas,

737
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 and they talk about this.

738
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 There was a pro-choice era and movement and platform that he ran on.

739
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 He said, "I'm against slavery, but here, it's a big country,

740
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 got a lot of states. Who am I to say people in Georgia

741
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 can't decide whether or not they should have slaves?"

742
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 And Lincoln said, "I am for choice,

743
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 but when the choice involves something as immoral as slavery,

744
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 it is wrong to say that a black person can be chosen

745
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 by the person who owns them over whether their value

746
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 is anything other than a human life.

747
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 To say that if the black person is not as valuable as a human life,

748
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 then sure, choice is involved, but when it comes to a person being a human,

749
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 being pro-choice about that is not an option."

750
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 This is a debate that's been going on for a long time.

751
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 Even the parallels as it relates to culture and society,

752
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 it was really split. There were some who were like, "Yes, so for slavery."

753
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 Others who were like, "No, I'm so against slavery."

754
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 Then there was this huge swap in the middle.

755
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 Many of them Christians who were like, "I'm pretty neutral.

756
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 I just don't really want to speak out about it.

757
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 I don't want to be convenient about it." And they were wrong.

758
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 If you think that you would have stood and fought against slavery,

759
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 you would have stood and fought against civil rights

760
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 or for civil rights with Martin Luther King Jr.,

761
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 and you won't fight for the right of the unborn,

762
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 I just want you to consider,

763
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 do you think that you really would have,

764
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 or would you have been in that middle group where it's neutral

765
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 and I just kind of want to stay out of it?

766
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 Because as Christians, we are called to speak up on this issue.

767
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 And the separation of church and state thing,

768
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 you may be like, "Yeah, but who am I to impose?"

769
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 Martin Luther King Jr.

770
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 Nobody ever hates on Martin Luther King Jr.

771
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 for bringing in his religious beliefs and convictions to say,

772
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 "Based on what I believe the Bible teaches,

773
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 it is wrong for someone to be judged on the content

774
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 or the color of their skin, not the content of their character.

775
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 Let justice flow like waters," he quoted from the book of Amos,

776
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 on the steps of the memorial or Lincoln Memorial.

777
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 And nobody had a problem with it.

778
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 Christians over and over are called to go against whatever culture says

779
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 if it contradicts the word of God and to raise our voice

780
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 and to fight for the needs of those who cannot fight for themselves.

781
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 And I want you to really think about that.

782
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 If you're listening,

783
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 and you won't fight for the rights of the unborn,

784
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 who are called, "Well, it's less than human,"

785
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 the parallels to slavery of, "Hey, you know, it's kind of,"

786
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 and they're not exactly the same, are shocking.

787
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 Do you really think you would have fought against Jim Crow?

788
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 You really think that you would have fought against slavery?

789
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 Because this is your time. This is your age. This is your era.

790
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 This is the time for you and I and Christians everywhere to say,

791
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 "We will see abortion end in our generation.

792
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 We're going to fight for life wound to the tomb.

793
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 We're going to care for people no matter where they are on the spectrum of life.

794
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 We're going to care for the immigrant. We're going to care for all people.

795
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 But there is no group that is being killed

796
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 at the rate that the unborn is.

797
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 And society is applauding it and allowing it

798
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 and fighting for it and enabling it.

799
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 And it is the most moral blind spot we have ever had.

800
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 America has more pro-abortion allowance

801
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 than almost every country on earth.

802
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 We are some of the most radical as it relates to you can kill a child

803
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 up to 39 weeks in many places in our country.

804
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 Think about that. In terms of France, Spain, Germany,

805
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 the limit is 12 weeks and you've got to go see a counselor for three days

806
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 to even have it before you can do that.

807
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 They look at America and they're like, "Dude, you guys are crazy.

808
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 We're right there with China, Russia, and North Korea.

809
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 Are those the nations that you want to be mentioned with?"

810
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 And yet so many Christians, and it's candidly because this has been hijacked

811
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 by this like, "Women's rights, we've got to stay together, guys."

812
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 In a front to God, I am all for women's rights.

813
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 And whether you're a man, a woman, black, white, Hispanic, whatever,

814
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 we've got to come together and say whatever our differences are,

815
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 we are going to be united on this.

816
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 In conclusion, what is the application from this?

817
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 It's a few things. Number one, if this is a part of your story,

818
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 and God isn't done with you, and I just want you to invite,

819
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 or I want to invite you to recover.

820
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 We have a ministry here that is entirely devoted to helping you,

821
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 just like all of us have sexual sin in our past and issues in our past,

822
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 we just need to recover.

823
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 And there's an entire ministry that's devoted called Life Initiatives.

824
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 Life Initiative that's here, it's about abortion, post-abortion care.

825
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 You can go to watermark.org, type in Life Initiatives.

826
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 Or you can just email us at info@theportrait.live.

827
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 We'll connect you, and you'll find other women there

828
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 who've walked alongside, and God is using their story.

829
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 He's redeeming it. Some of the most godly women I know

830
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 have that as a part of their story. It doesn't define them.

831
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 And they are redefining the way that our society and women and people in general

832
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 understand where life is found, which is in Jesus.

833
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 It's the first thing would be recover.

834
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 We have volunteers and men and women tonight who are here

835
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
 who have that a part of their story that would love to talk and connect with you.

836
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 Number two, we've got to pray.

837
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 We have to hit our knees and pray, God, not just on election year, but every day.

838
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 And every year, God, will you end abortion in our generation?

839
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 You've ended the atrocities, slavery in our past.

840
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 You ended what happened in Nazi Germany.

841
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 Will you end again what is taking place in our land?

842
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 It is insanity that a bald eagle egg, if you touch, could cost you $250,000.

843
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 But if you kill a life in the womb, it is a constitutional right.

844
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 That is insane.

845
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 So we've got to pray because this is just our nation's conscience is seared as it relates to this.

846
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 Number three, use your voice.

847
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 Just like I said, speaking out and knowing where you stand on this issue

848
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 and advocating for it and raising up our voice, just like they did with bald eagle eggs.

849
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 We're going to raise up our voice and advocate that legislation happen to protect these.

850
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 That we would raise up our voice.

851
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 Number four, vote.

852
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 Whether this is a part of your story or not, every time that you vote, and by voting in --

853
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 and this is not just the president.

854
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 This isn't an issue that no matter what happens on November 3rd is going to go away.

855
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 This is an issue that we have to be people who say we are going to stay informed on this

856
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 and we're going to hold you accountable and we're going to see that we pass legislation

857
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 and life is beginning to win again in America.

858
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 The generation that is right here, young adults, is beginning to turn the tide on their perspective

859
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 on yeah, this is pretty messed up.

860
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 In 1973 with Roe v. Wade, they didn't have 3D sonograms.

861
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 They didn't have the ability to go, oh yeah, that baby is smiling at me right now.

862
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 And now is our time to begin to vote, hold people accountable, and push.

863
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 This is an issue that cannot be one that we give in on.

864
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 Number five, if you or someone you know -- listen to me very clearly.

865
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 Listen to me very, very clearly.

866
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 If you find yourself in a situation where you're pregnant, have an unplanned pregnancy,

867
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 or you know someone who does, I want you to bring the baby here.

868
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 You can bring the baby to us.

869
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 We will take care of your baby.

870
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 We'll come alongside that person if they just need help and care and they're trying to walk through that.

871
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 I want you to tell them they can bring the child here.

872
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 We will take them and walk with them every single step of the way.

873
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 So if you're like, I don't know what to do, what are even our options, this just feels so crazy,

874
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 you can tell them or you can know, you can bring the child here.

875
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 We will care for the child and find a place and help make an adoption plan to find a home for them.

876
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 And number six, serve.

877
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 Some of you have this as a part of your story, you don't.

878
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 It's just a passion point and there's opportunities we'd love to let you know about,

879
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 whether it be through Thrive, which is the ministry that these -- Meredith and Farrah were a part of,

880
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 that weekly helps women who are in that situation that is such a terrifying one to be in,

881
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 help them take the next step in their unplanned pregnancies, put together an adoption plan,

882
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 put together a plan for care and walk alongside of them.

883
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 Maybe you serve in that or maybe you serve in life initiative, this is a part of your story.

884
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 You, if you're a follower of Jesus and it's there, you have no idea how powerful your story is

885
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 to other women who feel covered in shame, covered in guilt, covered without hope,

886
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 and you and your testimony of God's goodness, despite all of our messed up decisions,

887
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 this part of your story is like a key that unlocks the shame and guilt and pain of people.

888
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 And you can serve in life initiative and share and use your mess to be a message for Christ.

889
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 In conclusion, I've said, and I'm about to end, I've said a lot that if you hear condemnation and shame and guilt,

890
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 I want you to listen to me abundantly clear, that is not from the Lord.

891
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 How do I know that?

892
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 There's an interesting moment in John chapter 8, we talked about before, where it's a woman who's in sexual sin

893
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 and Jesus' response gives us some indication of how he'd respond to you,

894
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 whether you just looked at pornography, whether he would respond to you as it relates to abortion

895
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 or sexual sin with your boyfriend or girlfriend, it gives us how he responds to broken, messed up people.

896
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 It's a woman who had been caught having sex with another man's wife, or another man who wasn't her husband.

897
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 Think about that moment.

898
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 Somebody busts in the door and they find this woman who's having sex with a man who's not her husband

899
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
 and they drag her half naked, they throw her in front of Jesus, in front of him,

900
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
 and this group surrounds Jesus, who's in the temple teaching, they throw this woman down.

901
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 And they say, "Jesus, we caught this woman in sexual sin, sleeping with a man who was not her husband.

902
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 The law says we should condemn her.

903
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 She should have the death penalty."

904
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
 What do you say?

905
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 What would the Son of God say to your worst moment?

906
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 I mean, you get caught having an affair with a guy who's married, that's a bad moment.

907
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 What would Jesus, God in a bod, perfection in sandals, walking on the planet,

908
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 eye to eye with this woman, what would he say?

909
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
 He bends over and he begins writing in the ground.

910
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 So that after a couple minutes, he stands up and he says to this crowd of men

911
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 and this terrified woman on the ground, half clothed, disheveled, ashamed,

912
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 he says, "Whoever has no sin, let them throw the surf stone."

913
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 After a moment, the men begin to leave.

914
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
 It says, "From the oldest to the youngest."

915
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
 And then it's just Jesus and the woman.

916
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
 And he bends back down, the text tells us, and he lifts up her face and says,

917
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 "Woman, where are your accusers?

918
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
 Does no one condemn you?"

919
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,000
 And the woman looks around and realizes it's just her and Jesus.

920
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
 And she says, "No one."

921
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
 And Jesus responds, "Neither do I.

922
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
 Go and sin no more."

923
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
 He looks at a woman who had the equivalent of an abortion or adultery or pornography

924
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
 or sexual sin that's in my life, and he looks right her in the eyes and says,

925
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
 "I don't condemn you.

926
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
 I don't condone what you did, but I don't condemn you,

927
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
 and I am calling you forward.

928
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
 Go and sin no more, child.

929
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
 Whatever you have done, whatever sin you think puts you beyond the length of God's love,

930
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
 you have bought a lie."

931
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 And Jesus would say to you, if that's a part of your story,

932
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 "The condemnation and guilt that you feel is not from him if you're a follower of Christ.

933
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
 He has paid for it.

934
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
 Let them define you.

935
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
 You have been washed and cleaned in his love and by him and by his love

936
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
 by what he did on the cross."

937
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
 And you can walk free in that.

938
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 And we can all together look around at society and say,

939
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
 "Man, we don't condemn what you have done.

940
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:45,000
 We don't condone it, and we are calling us as a nation, 'This has got to end.'"

941
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
 Whatever circumstance, whatever brokenness or whatever challenge

942
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 or whatever you think is, like, too far beyond God's reach

943
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
 or whatever circumstance you're in right now,

944
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 there is nothing that is impossible for God to turn around and use for good.

945
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
 No matter how bad things look, he can take the most crazy unplanned pregnancy

946
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
 and use it for incredible, incredible good.

947
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 How do I know that?

948
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
 Because the greatest act in human history was connected to an unplanned pregnancy.

949
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 Think about this.

950
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
 The greatest act in history.

951
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
 There was a young girl named Mary, 16 years old,

952
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,000
 realizes despite the fact that she's engaged, never had sex with anybody, she's pregnant.

953
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
 Angel shows up and says, "You're going to give birth to the Son of God."

954
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
 How did that conversation go with her mom?

955
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
 "Yeah, Mom, I'm pregnant."

956
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 "No, we didn't do--no handsy, no nothing. An angel."

957
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
 "Yeah, that--Joseph."

958
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
 Didn't go so well because Joseph, who she was engaged to, decided,

959
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
 "Man, clearly you've cheated. People don't just get impregnated out of the blue, so I'm out."

960
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,000
 So an angel shows up and says, "She is with a child who will be the Savior of the world."

961
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 An unplanned pregnancy that caught them totally off guard.

962
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
 They had no idea what was coming, but God did.

963
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
 Every unplanned pregnancy that catches anyone totally off guard,

964
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
 they had no idea what was coming, is one that God did.

965
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
 And He could take it, and just like He did in that situation,

966
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:15,000
 take even the most surprising, confusing, terrifying circumstances and use it for your good.

967
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
 He's already done it.

968
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
 But what He did with His Son, He gave His life and paid for all of our sins.

969
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,000
 Every sin in your past, in my past, in your future, in my future, all of it, paid for.

970
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
 And we receive that by trusting.

971
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,000
 You paid. You paid. You paid for me.

972
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
 And now we go advocate and we speak for those who can't speak for themselves.

973
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
 Let me pray.

974
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
 Father, I pray for anyone right now who--

975
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:53,000
 that just have never experienced freedom from the pain and shame.

976
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
 That You would be louder than any feelings of condemnation that they feel.

977
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:04,000
 That they would hear Your grace and Your forgiveness and You call them by name and You love them.

978
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
 You died for them. You're crazy about them.

979
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
 You're not done with them. You've forgiven them.

980
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
 That those would ring loudly.

981
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:21,000
 I pray for any person who listens to this and finds himself in that situation of an unplanned pregnancy,

982
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
 that they would take the steps that are in line with Your Word.

983
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 And they would walk through, either giving the child, making an adoption plan, or raising the child.

984
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:38,000
 And You would have them walk with that child in a full relationship with You for a full life.

985
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
 Father, would You end abortion in our generation?

986
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,000
 Would You put in office men who don't just say they're for pro-life, but they are pro-life?

987
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
 And would You capture the hearts and save men and women who refuse to do so?

988
00:57:51,000 --> 00:58:01,000
 Would You awaken our country's conscience to this blind immorality that is currently amongst us?

989
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:07,000
 And would You help us as Your church to be winsome, engaging, courageous, and loving as we do so?

990
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:13,000
 And use our voice and point people to the One who saves all people, who created all people,

991
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
 and who gives offer of eternal life and abundant life, now and forever.

992
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
 In Christ's name, Amen.
