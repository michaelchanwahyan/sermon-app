[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.360]   - All right, what's up everybody in the room?
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.780]   Everybody tuning in online,
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.820]   wherever you're joining us from,
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.800]   Portslough Midland, Tulsa, North Houston,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.200]   Boise, Cedar Rapids, Greater Lafayette, Indianapolis,
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.960]   all the different Portslough locations.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.040]   We are wrapping up the book of Ephesians tonight.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.360]   Let me bring you in a little bit to my world
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.120]   or give us some handholds for where we're going.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.360]   Around this time last week, I was here at the porch
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.280]   and I could just tell something was not right
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.720]   with me like physically stomach.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.520]   You know, those moments where you're like,
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.880]   man, this is something, this is not right.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.040]   It's not just something I ate.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.160]   And later that night, I started just a stomach flu
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.000]   that I had gotten from my son.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.320]   And so all last week was just this miserable,
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.800]   you know, from Wednesday on of stomach sickness.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.240]   And I knew that the weekend,
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.240]   we had a number of big plans going on,
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.300]   stuff each night and we were supposed to host
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.120]   one of my oldest son's friends.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.240]   He was gonna come do a sleepover.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240]   A couple in our community group was going to get away
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.600]   and we divided and conquered the kids.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.880]   And so I was worried, man,
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.040]   we're gonna have people over at the house.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.480]   Someone ended up getting him sick and, you know,
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.080]   thank the Lord, everything passed.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.920]   It was all fun.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.080]   The weekend came, we got to host him.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.000]   It was a great time, had a ton of fun
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.480]   and everything was going great.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.480]   And my son and you know, his friend were playing
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.600]   and just like one of those weekends where you're like,
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.880]   hey, you say it, we're gonna do it.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.020]   Popsicles in the middle of the night.
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.540]   We're doing popsicles in the middle of the night.
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.880]   Let's make some memories.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.000]   It was all fun and games until Sunday around lunch,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.560]   we had all as a family and this kid
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.040]   that was staying with us went to church
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.440]   and we came home and we began to eat lunch
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.080]   and set out lunch for all the kids.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.760]   And I can tell his name's Cade,
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.120]   something was wrong with Cade.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.960]   And he's sitting there going like,
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.800]   oh, I'm not hungry, I don't wanna eat.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.720]   Which as a six year old is not that unusual.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.040]   A lot of times it's just like, I just don't wanna eat that.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.480]   And it's like, is there something else you wanna eat?
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.560]   Is it something wrong with the food?
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.400]   Do you not like that?
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.480]   And he's like, no, I just don't really wanna eat.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.200]   And then eventually he says, can I go lay down?
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.520]   And I begin to go, okay,
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.740]   there's clearly something going wrong.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.560]   But it's been a great weekend, lots of fun.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.320]   His parents are gonna be here in like an hour and a half.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.480]   It'll be great.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.280]   I am putting my baby son or my youngest son down for a nap.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.400]   And I hear this explosion of what sounded like a hose
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.240]   running in our living room all over the couch.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.240]   And I look back and he has gone full send
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.960]   all over the couch cushions and everywhere.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.320]   It was just like a hose.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.520]   And I don't know if you're the type of person,
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.440]   I'm like, if somebody starts throwing up, I may throw up.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.240]   Because it's just like, I am not okay.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.320]   But I'm conflicted now
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.160]   'cause I put my youngest down for a nap
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.400]   and I'm like, oh man, oh, poor guy.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.160]   And oh, let's go outside.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.400]   Okay, here we go.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.320]   And I take him outside and I go back into the house
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.080]   and I'm trying to get all the other kids, hey, get away.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.040]   You get away from, everybody get away.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.120]   Everybody get away, go eat ice cream,
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.960]   do whatever you want.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.560]   Just get away from all the vomit.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.640]   And I begin to go into full cleaning mode
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.760]   where I'm spraying Lysol on everything.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.920]   I'm taking couch cushions outside and just hosing them down
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.560]   and going, we may just need to burn this couch.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.880]   It may just be done.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.680]   And I'm spraying everything I can
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.680]   'cause we've been sick all week
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.800]   and I don't want the kids to get sick again.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.240]   And I'm just trying to do anything I can to make sure
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.520]   that any of the germs and stuff that he had touched.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.520]   So I'm in there like literally spraying my kids up and down
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.400]   and spraying everything that they'd been around and touched.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.560]   And my daughter, she is like in love with hand sanitizer,
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.000]   which she calls handitizer.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.440]   And she's like, hey, you are now full duty.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.280]   You're gonna go around
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.680]   and you're cleaning everyone's hands every three minutes.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.920]   So she's just like on it.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.640]   Everybody's cleaning everything
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.520]   because I know that even though I can't see the germs
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.720]   that are around here, they could be there.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.760]   And that's just gonna, this invisible world
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.320]   is gonna make some real complications in all of our life.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.400]   So we are cleaning everything.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.200]   Now, when I say that invisible world, 'cause it's 2022,
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.240]   we all know what I mean.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   I did germs and something can not be visible,
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.600]   but have the ability to really impact what is visible.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.920]   We understand it as germs.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.440]   But that idea was something that for most of history,
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.440]   people didn't understand until this guy came along.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.400]   Now you probably don't remember him.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.840]   That's Luis Pasteur for all of the biology majors
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.960]   and people who studied in the room.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.600]   And he came up with what is called modern germ theory,
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.120]   where he actually had a few kids
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.640]   that passed away from typhoid fever.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.080]   And so he devoted his life to studying diseases
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.640]   and how they passed.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.240]   And around the 1880s, he came up with this theory
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.560]   that he had concluded, hey,
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.240]   there's something called germs.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.280]   There's an invisible world
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.440]   that's impacting the visible world.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.320]   And it's what's causing so many of the problems
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.600]   and sicknesses that are around us.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.380]   We hear that and we go, yeah, duh.
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.720]   But when he introduced that idea,
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.020]   it was like saying there's aliens
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.600]   that are invisible around us.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.640]   People were skeptical of, oh, there's an invisible world
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.960]   that's responsible for why people are getting sick.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.800]   Is that right?
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.760]   And yet it was entirely true.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.000]   There was an invisible world
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.320]   that was clearly affecting the visible world.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.440]   Now, what does all of that have to do
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.800]   with what we're gonna talk about tonight?
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.880]   Well, in the last chapter of the book of Ephesians,
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.120]   which I said, we've been journeying
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.000]   through the last six or seven weeks,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.960]   walking through this incredible letter
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.760]   that the apostle Paul wrote from a prison cell
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.520]   to the church in Ephesus.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.960]   And in the last chapter of the book,
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.600]   he brings up a very similar idea
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.600]   where he says there is an invisible spiritual realm
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.280]   that is impacting what is visible in this realm.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.960]   And it is a spiritual realm that though you can't see
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.380]   is having dramatic implications on your life.
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.840]   It's having implications on everything you've ever known.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.240]   The home you were raised in, the life that you've had today
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.360]   has been impacted by this invisible world.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.040]   And as startling as it was for Lelis Pastor
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.920]   to introduce germ theory and there's these germs,
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.840]   you can't see them, but they're there
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.560]   and they're impacting it,
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.360]   it may seem shocking to some of us
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.720]   that there could be a non-visible world,
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.200]   but Paul is saying it may not be something
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.360]   you could see with the visible eye,
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.360]   but it is impacting your life
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.240]   and is going to shape and impact your future.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.240]   But the good news is God has not left us
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.980]   just to wing it with this invisible realm,
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.480]   but has communicated clearly
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.380]   how you and I are to go and battle as believers
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.700]   and live out our faith in light of that visible realm,
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.880]   how it intersects with this world.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.680]   So we're gonna walk through the last 12 verses
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.960]   of Ephesians chapter six.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.800]   If you haven't joined us, we've walked through six chapters.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.440]   The first three chapters are all about
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.480]   the wealth of a believer.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.720]   The things that if you're in Christ,
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.800]   if you put your faith in Jesus as your Lord and Savior,
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.140]   his death on the cross, his resurrection from the dead,
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.240]   his payment for your sin, you believe that.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.380]   You were adopted into the family of God.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.360]   In three chapters worth, Paul goes into all that you have
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.400]   and you're seated in the heavenly places
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.600]   and you will have a love of God towards you
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.720]   that's greater than you could ever understand.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.740]   It's beautiful, beautiful description
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.840]   of the wealth we have in Christ.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.000]   And then in chapters four and five,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.480]   he goes into the walk of those in Christ.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.120]   And tonight we're gonna look at his final instructions
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.740]   on the warfare of those in Christ.
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:16.740]   And Paul writes a few years before he would lose his life
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.660]   for promoting Christianity from a prison cell.
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.960]   And he writes these final words and instructions
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.780]   and says to this group, I mean,
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.400]   he loved the church in Ephesus.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.740]   As I've said before, Ephesus is in modern day Turkey.
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.180]   You could get on a plane and go visit it today.
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.540]   Incredibly influential city.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.460]   And Paul loved this church.
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.360]   And he writes out some of the last words
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   he would ever write.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.160]   And we're gonna look at those instructions
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.260]   on the spiritual invisible world
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260]   that is impacting the visible one.
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.320]   Starting in verse 10.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:55.460]   Finally, be strong in the Lord
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.300]   and in his mighty power.
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.980]   Put on the full armor of God.
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.820]   We're gonna unpack exhaustively
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.100]   what that is here in a second.
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.100]   So that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.060]   For our struggle, our battle,
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.060]   is not against flesh and blood.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.500]   Not against the visible.
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.460]   It is against the rulers, against authorities,
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.440]   against the powers of this dark world,
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.440]   against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.160]   That Paul, as he's wrapping up, he says,
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.720]   hey, finally, make sure that you stand firm.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.120]   You are strong in the Lord.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.760]   There is a war taking place.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.520]   There is a spiritual realm and a spiritual war
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.560]   that is taking place all around you.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.180]   The first idea that Paul introduces to
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.400]   is that they and we are in the midst of a spiritual war.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.340]   A spiritual war.
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.380]   Part of understanding the unseen realm
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.800]   is knowing that in that unseen realm,
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.280]   there is a spiritual war that is taking place.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.500]   And he gives us an indication of how you and I
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.800]   are to succeed in the visible world in light of that.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.280]   And that we are to find our strength,
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.480]   the first thing that he points out,
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.600]   is to be strong in the Lord and the strength of his might.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.640]   In other words, don't find your strength
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:20.240]   in your gifting, in your job, in your appearance,
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.420]   in the family of origin that you came from.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.760]   Don't find your strength in what other people
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.600]   think about you.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.160]   That you and I are to find our strength
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.440]   in walking in dependence in the Lord.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.440]   The scriptures teach that, ironically,
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.160]   it's in the areas of our life that we feel weakest,
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.220]   that God and his strength can be greatest.
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.560]   Second Corinthians chapter 12,
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.760]   the apostle Paul also writes,
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.840]   and he writes that whenever I'm weak,
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.800]   it's an opportunity for God's power
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.000]   to more fully rest and be revealed in my life.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.600]   Whenever I'm weak, I'm strong.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.760]   Whatever area of your life where you feel weakest,
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.320]   maybe you struggle with anxiety,
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.340]   maybe there's some insecurities you have
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.060]   over how the last relationship went,
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:21.600]   or the fact that there hasn't been one.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:27.200]   Maybe it's just some issues that,
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.120]   man, if you were honest,
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.280]   that you've carried since high school.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.440]   Whatever the area is for you,
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.200]   wherever you feel weakest is one of the areas
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.900]   where you can experience the greatest amount
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.760]   of God's strength.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.040]   By surrendering that to him, by bringing that to him,
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.160]   the weakest areas in the room are often
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.120]   the strongest examples or testimonies
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.400]   of God's power on display.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.360]   And Paul would say, man, whatever your insecurity,
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.800]   weakness that you feel, that is not a problem.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.880]   That can be a platform to showcase the power of God
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.240]   in our world, his ability to change.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.560]   And then he introduces us to the unseen realm.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.300]   And maybe it's your first time in church in a while,
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.980]   and you read it, and appropriately so,
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.240]   you go, there's an unseen spiritual forces of darkness?
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.200]   That reads like Star Wars or something.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.200]   What are you saying?
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   And Paul is saying there is a war that is taking place,
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.680]   and he's gonna unpack more of what's involved in that war.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.040]   But part of the reason this is so important to understand
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:35.040]   is in order to bring about the appropriate solution
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:41.720]   to a problem, you have to understand the problem.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.040]   In other words, if you were to go to the doctor today,
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.400]   and you went in solemn, and you weren't feeling good
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.520]   for whatever reason, and you went to the doctor,
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.640]   you waited in the waiting room,
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.760]   finally the doctor comes in, and you said,
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.840]   yeah, doctor, I don't feel good, and he said, perfect.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.720]   I got just the thing.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.080]   He walks into another room, there's medicine everywhere,
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.560]   he's just like, eenie, meenie, miney, moe,
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.080]   okay, I'll give him this one, and he walks back,
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.500]   gives it, and says, you should be good.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.000]   You'd go, wait, what?
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.560]   I didn't even tell you my symptoms.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.520]   Because without telling you the symptoms
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.460]   or understanding the problem, you're not gonna be able
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.080]   to effectively identify a solution.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.640]   And Paul is helping point out that the problem
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.160]   and the issue inside of the world around you
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.560]   is much deeper than you think.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.920]   There is a spiritual element to the problems
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.120]   that you see in society, to the problems that you face
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.480]   and have faced in your own life.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.540]   There's a spiritual element to the reason
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.760]   that your parents' marriage didn't last,
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:44.240]   that there is a spiritual aspect and element
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.800]   to any, name any of the problems in the world
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.800]   and culture and society around.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.680]   And apart from understanding that,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.420]   you won't know that the solution
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.940]   is not gonna be more education,
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.520]   or the solution will not be more money,
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.280]   or the solution will not be X, Y, or Z,
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.760]   if it doesn't involve a spiritual aspect or Jesus.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.420]   Because Paul would say, no, no, no,
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:13.640]   what's visible is a reflection of a spiritual war
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.520]   that is taking place all around us.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.860]   So the first idea that we see is, man,
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.280]   there is a spiritual war that is happening
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.920]   and taking place all around us.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.480]   I think one of the tensions in teaching a message like this
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.840]   is there's probably two errors inside of the room
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.960]   in terms of when it comes to the spiritual realm
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.040]   and angelic forces and demonic things
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.840]   and the devil and what role that plays.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.640]   And on one hand, it would be over here thinking,
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.360]   man, I don't even know that I believe that,
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.800]   or I'm not even sure that exists,
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.960]   or that's not even a part of impacting my life in any way.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.960]   That would be a flawed perspective, non-biblical perspective.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.980]   The other side of the pendulum would be over here
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.720]   where you have the perspective
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.200]   that everything wrong in your life
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.280]   is 'cause, man, I was running late today,
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.680]   and the devil, not today, Satan,
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.420]   and everything in your life is attributable
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.920]   to just something popped out of nowhere,
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.760]   and I'm under an attack, and then my car broke down.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.520]   And the reality is your car broke down
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.040]   because your check engine light's been on
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.840]   for like three years, and you haven't got an oil change.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.840]   Or you had problems at work, and you're just like,
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.460]   man, devil's out to get me, and problem with my boss,
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.400]   and the reason you have a problem at work
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.440]   is 'cause you keep sleeping through your alarm
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.600]   and showing up an hour and a half early.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.240]   You don't have to point to the devil on that.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.720]   You can point to waking up.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.560]   But it is undeniably true that there is a spiritual realm
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.200]   that is influencing and impacting this one,
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.200]   and Paul is introducing that in order to walk through
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.960]   the next thing, which is understanding the enemy
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.560]   that you and I share, as believers in Christ that we share.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.400]   He already referenced him.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.200]   He said, "The schemes of the devil."
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.760]   So there's a spiritual war against the spiritual enemy,
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.040]   which is the devil, that there is someone,
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.480]   the Bible says, that formerly, just quick background,
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.240]   as Christians, the Bible teaches that there is a enemy
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.400]   and ruler of this world, a source of the evil
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.400]   that we see around us, and he formerly was an angel
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.560]   in heaven, and Jesus describes how he was cast out of heaven
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.080]   for not wanting to worship God, but wanting to be God,
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.680]   and now he has been sentenced to eternal hell,
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.960]   and he wants to take as many people who are made
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.520]   in the image of God with him before
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.960]   that final judgment happens,
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.800]   and that's what he's up to right now,
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.480]   and he is a spiritual enemy that, although,
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.600]   if you're a believer in Christ,
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.800]   he can't take away your salvation.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.580]   He wants to do anything and everything that he can
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.960]   to ruin anything good and of God in your life,
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.160]   that he hates you, he hates the healthy dating relationships
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.080]   in the room, he wants to destroy them.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.600]   He wants you to marry somebody who treats you poorly,
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.520]   and he wants you to embrace a mentality that thinks,
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.080]   "I deserve to be treated poorly."
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.480]   He wants you to not reconcile that relationship
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.760]   and that friendship with that person
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.540]   and maintain the mindset that, you know what?
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.880]   That's on them, I've done enough, it's on them.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.040]   I'm cutting them out of my life.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.480]   He wants you to think of work as a place
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.960]   where you find your identity,
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.880]   not provide a paycheck and promote Jesus,
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.000]   but you find your identity and your value,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.320]   and then you become a workaholic.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.880]   He wants to take something God gave,
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.960]   like the gift of sex intended for marriage,
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.560]   and he wants you to use it on your own personal pleasure
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.560]   and satisfaction through pornography
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.480]   or through sexuality and dating content.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.440]   He wants to do anything that he can to take you out,
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.840]   and the intensity that Paul writes with,
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.380]   he says he is scheming.
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.480]   The Greek word he uses,
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.360]   Greek is the language the New Testament was written in,
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.400]   it's the word for tricks,
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.400]   that he is attempting to do anything he can
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.240]   to take you out, that he knows you,
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.240]   he knows your struggles,
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.720]   he knows the temptations and weaknesses that you have.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.280]   He wants you to stay isolated,
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.720]   he wants you to not be connected to other people in church,
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.560]   he wants you to live for the weekend,
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.040]   he wants to do anything that he can to take you out,
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.040]   that he has a plan and desire
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:21.660]   to interrupt the faith of as many believers as possible.
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.760]   If he was gonna take you out, do you know where?
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.400]   'Cause he is, according to Paul and Peter and other places,
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.880]   seeking to devour and destroy relationships
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.880]   inside of this room.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.840]   In 1898, the British were attempting to build a railway
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:51.720]   that would spread across much of the continent of Africa,
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.260]   and it would allow trains to move cargo
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.640]   and move things back and forth with greater ease.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.160]   And one of the areas they were doing that
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.740]   was in a place called Savo, Kenya.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.000]   Savo, Kenya, and specifically,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.840]   when they got to the town of Savo,
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.800]   they're building this railway
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.280]   to be able to transport stuff all across Africa.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.880]   1898.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.880]   When they got to the town,
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.540]   there was a river that they couldn't go around,
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.380]   they had to go through,
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.560]   so they had to build a bridge over the Savo River.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.120]   And they would build this bridge and railway,
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.820]   and it would allow things to move over,
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.160]   and a plan was put in place for nine months,
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.360]   they're gonna build this bridge,
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.380]   thousands of people were brought in in order to work on it.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.880]   And as construction began,
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.600]   workers started disappearing.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.800]   And at first, people thought,
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.640]   that's just, I guess they didn't wanna work,
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.080]   or they ran away, or they abandoned it.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:51.900]   And then people who they knew weren't abandoning their work
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.740]   started disappearing.
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.880]   Like, they had like a family,
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.820]   and they had people that were there,
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.560]   and they're like, Carl hadn't come home, like, he's gone,
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.680]   and we don't know where he is.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.800]   And he wouldn't have just ran away into the jungle.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:09.480]   And one day they stumbled on the head,
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:18.240]   only the head of one of the people who was missing.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.100]   And they described it as though his face
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.600]   looked like it was smiling.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:28.280]   And of course, they're all terrified, and this is bizarre.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.560]   And shortly after that,
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.160]   they discovered it was because a lion had attacked
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.640]   and was licking his dead carcass.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.520]   And two lions for the next nine months
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.240]   would kill 135 men in the middle of the night.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.480]   They named them Darkness and Ghost.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.760]   They would show up, there's not electricity around,
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.120]   there's no high-level machinery,
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.940]   they had very few weapons or guns,
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:57.200]   and they would drag men out of their tent.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.040]   And they would kill them.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.480]   135.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:09.100]   They studied, and they at one point realized
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.160]   that they were showing up, and they had a hospital
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.040]   of just people that had been injured working on the railroad,
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:19.040]   and the lions targeted the hospital where there was wounded.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.360]   One point, they moved the hospital, they realized this,
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.240]   and they're like, here's what we're gonna do,
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.800]   we're gonna set a trap for these animals.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.120]   And so they took the hospital,
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.560]   and they moved it a mile away to the other side of the camp.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.440]   And inside of the old hospital,
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.800]   they put all types of dead animals and dead blood
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.520]   to set a trap, 'cause they would smell the blood
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.920]   and they would come in there.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:45.480]   But the lions didn't go to the old hospital.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.640]   They found the new one.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.880]   And they killed more men.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.560]   It's crazy, I mean, they made a movie about it,
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.400]   Val Kilmer, like the '90s.
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.980]   What does that have to do with this?
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.540]   The scripture says in 1 Peter chapter five,
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.820]   there's a roaring lion who is looking and seeking
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.660]   to devour and destroy you and your faith.
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.620]   And he wants you to listen and think,
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.740]   man, it's not that serious, it's not that big of a deal,
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.140]   he couldn't take me out.
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:15.220]   And not have a guardedness as it relates
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.780]   to the fact that there is a spiritual enemy.
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.700]   As I said, 1 Peter chapter five, verse eight,
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.340]   your enemy, the devil, prowls like a roaring lion
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.340]   looking for someone to devour.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:30.820]   All right, so there's a spiritual war,
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:35.100]   there's a spiritual enemy, and then Paul brings up,
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.760]   but you and I in Christ have spiritual weapons
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.420]   that you and I are to apply inside of our life.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.660]   And he begins to talk about the armor of God.
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:48.660]   And he uses metaphor and images to describe
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.700]   how these different weapons, so to speak,
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.660]   and he's describing Roman armor,
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.420]   which Paul was sitting in a jail cell
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.540]   across from a Roman prisoner, most likely,
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.180]   and he's describing how in Christ,
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.420]   we have these certain, it's like they're pieces of armor,
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.140]   and he walks through them, and I'm gonna go through them fast
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.020]   and then try to unpack how they connect
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.500]   and what practically that actually looks like in our life.
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.420]   But he says, therefore put on the full armor of God
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.500]   so that when the day of evil comes,
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.880]   you may be able to stand your ground.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.460]   And after you have done everything to stand.
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.740]   So third idea from the text
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.300]   is the spiritual weapons we have.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.700]   Stand, therefore, having fastened the belt of truth.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.780]   He brings up the belt.
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.220]   The belt and the Roman armor
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.900]   was the thing that held everything together,
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.940]   held the tunic and the pants, held the breastplate down,
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.260]   the sword when attached to it.
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.780]   He said it's like truth, the truth from God's word.
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.940]   It's like it anchors and connects everything together.
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:46.180]   The year to be marked and anchored by truth.
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.820]   In the world around us, we live at a time
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.760]   when people say, you know, what is truth?
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.600]   You got your truth, I got my truth, they got their truth.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.780]   The Bible says that's not right at all.
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:05.960]   There is truth and then there's lies.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.120]   And the scriptures lead us to God's truth.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.720]   And Paul says those are to be the thing
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.800]   that constantly anchors your life.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   So you're marked and armed by the belt of truth.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.840]   Having the breastplate of righteousness,
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.420]   having put on the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.260]   What does that mean?
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:30.820]   The breastplate would have covered the middle of the body.
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.980]   It was incredibly important in ancient times
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.760]   because like a bulletproof vest today,
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:40.300]   it covers and protects the most important organs
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.140]   in the body.
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.740]   That if you get shot in the leg, man, you can keep moving.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.220]   If you get shot in the heart, that's a different story.
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.060]   And so it was a very big deal
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.740]   to have a solid protective breastplate.
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.620]   And Paul says, just like a Roman soldier
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.740]   has that protection there,
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.660]   it's like the righteousness of God, not self-righteousness.
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.940]   The righteousness of God,
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.560]   have it placed over your spiritual heart.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.220]   Practically, that looks like two ways.
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.100]   It looks like proactively, I'm gonna pursue,
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.900]   now as a believer in Jesus,
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.180]   things that are consistent with the righteousness of God.
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.060]   I'm gonna be protective of my heart.
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.500]   I'm gonna begin to protect it
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.900]   in line with God's righteousness.
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.900]   The Bible says in Proverbs chapter four, verse 23,
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.660]   King Solomon, wisest man who ever lived,
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:28.180]   "Above everything else I've ever taught,
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:32.820]   "guard and protect your heart and what you feed it
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.700]   "because everything else you do in life
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.340]   "flows from your heart."
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.580]   Above everything else, Solomon wrote Ecclesiastes,
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.500]   Song of Solomon, lots of Proverbs,
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:45.020]   everything else, protect what you are feeding your heart.
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.140]   Through the Netflix shows you're watching,
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:53.020]   are they marked with the righteousness
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.860]   and protection of God's righteousness?
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.820]   Through the bachelor and the bachelorette,
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.300]   is it feeding a righteousness?
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.420]   And I'm not saying it's not, I'm not saying you can't,
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.860]   I'm not saying ask, that's between you
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.580]   and asking the question, like,
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.340]   is this producing and protecting a righteousness?
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.180]   What am I feeding?
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.780]   A music you're listening to, scrolling through TikTok.
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.420]   And then the other security that comes
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:22.140]   is that we have put on the righteousness of God
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.980]   over our spiritual heart, as in God in Christ,
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.180]   when you trusted in him, you were sealed,
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.020]   you were placed into the righteousness of God
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.300]   and Jesus's righteousness is righteous and perfect
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.900]   as Jesus is, that was extended to you.
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.700]   And now our hearts are no longer defined
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.620]   by the actions that we have, the story we have,
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.660]   the path that you have, but by the righteousness of God,
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.500]   that when he looks, Jesus, when God looks at you,
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:49.020]   the righteousness of Jesus is what marks you.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.860]   Second Corinthians chapter five, verse 21 says,
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:55.820]   "He made Jesus, who had never sinned, become sin
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.460]   so that you and I could become the righteousness of God."
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.540]   And he says, it's like, it's been placed over your heart.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.500]   You can live in light of that reality,
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.060]   that as John would write in first John chapter three,
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:12.060]   verse 20, that even when your hearts condemn you,
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:17.420]   he is greater than our hearts for those who are in Christ,
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.820]   that the righteousness of God has been placed over you.
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:25.500]   Then he says, then as your shoes that you'd put on,
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.500]   as it were, shoes that have the readiness given
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.060]   by the gospel of peace to take and spread the message
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.420]   of the gospel to the world, in every circumstance,
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.580]   take up the shield of faith,
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.340]   this thing that will protect you
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.340]   with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.440]   of the evil one.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.420]   Again, he's using ancient language and descriptions.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.580]   In that time, when someone would go to war,
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.740]   they would have this big shield
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.700]   and the enemy would shoot arrows and different objects
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.540]   that were lit on fire.
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.220]   And the Romans would take that giant shield
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.860]   and they placed a huge soaking wet leather
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.740]   on the outside of it so that when an arrow
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:06.500]   that was on fire hit it, it would extinguish.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.900]   And Paul says in the same way, when you walk by faith,
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:09.720]   what is faith?
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.940]   It is trusting in God.
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.860]   It is when God says, this is how you should think about life,
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.180]   this is who to look for in marriage,
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:19.020]   this is the type of way to think about money,
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.080]   that you say, man, I'm gonna trust that, I'm gonna do that.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.460]   When I disagree with that, it's not 'cause God's wrong,
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.820]   it's 'cause I'm wrong, and so I need to move
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.780]   towards that direction.
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.600]   When you begin to do that, it's like you put this protection
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.200]   over your life, he says, it's like a shield of faith.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:37.080]   And he says, and then take up the helmet of salvation,
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.580]   that your mind would be marked.
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:45.100]   With a death grip on the fact that you have been
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.940]   in Christ adopted as a child of God,
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.740]   you have been sealed for all of eternity,
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.740]   and when doubts begin to creep in your head,
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.260]   and when thoughts of like, man, maybe this whole Jesus thing
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.980]   is not even real, maybe I'm not even, you know,
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.960]   maybe I need to do more in order to have eternal life,
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.140]   that you would know, no, I have been marked,
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:08.020]   and my mind is guarded by the helmet of salvation.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.860]   And then finally, the sword of the Spirit,
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.540]   which is the word of God.
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:17.080]   The only offensive weapon in the whole list he gives is,
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.380]   and then you take the sword, and what's the sword?
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:23.460]   It's the sword of the Spirit, and it's the word of God.
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.140]   It's like you take the scriptures,
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.100]   and the way that you fight, and the way that you and I
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:30.540]   live in this life is to live according to what God's word
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:33.220]   instructs us to live, it's proactively living
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.820]   according to what God's word says.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.300]   This is how you succeed, this is how victory happens,
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.100]   this is just how we experience life,
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.340]   which means living in community with other people,
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.220]   and opening up, and confessing sin, and being generous,
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.580]   and asking for forgiveness, and living according
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.560]   to God's word, saying, you're doing that.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.700]   You're proactive, it's the offensive weapon
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.660]   I have given you to live your faith out.
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.700]   I didn't realize until this past week,
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.580]   and researching really for something else,
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.040]   how big the video game industry has become.
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.300]   And any big video game people in here?
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:16.780]   Okay, clearly you're all liars, I know that you are.
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.260]   And you just don't want to admit it,
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.620]   'cause you're like, oh no, I'm gonna be single forever.
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.960]   And I'm totally kidding.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.940]   It is a massive, which is why I know I'm confident
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.220]   there are people all over this room
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.220]   that are a part of video game, why do I say that?
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.740]   The video game industry in just the United States
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:35.380]   is bigger than the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL,
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.220]   whatever the American Soccer Association is called,
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:42.460]   and, that's not a dig, I don't know.
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:47.460]   And, the Hollywood movie industry combined.
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.620]   Let me say that again.
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.020]   If you stack up the total annual revenue of NBA,
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:57.620]   NFL, MLB, NHL, soccer, and the movie industry
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:03.780]   in the United States, it is by a significant margin.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.020]   You could combine all of them and double it.
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.620]   And the video game industry's still bigger.
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.760]   Exploded.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.360]   And you think about why.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.440]   I mean, millions and millions of Americans
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.920]   are just intrigued, and, you know,
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.140]   some for good reasons, some I'm sure for not.
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.860]   But one of the appeals of the video game
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.860]   is when I enter into that space,
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.500]   I know what the objective is,
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:36.040]   and I can pursue being successful and victorious.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.880]   And Paul is saying, hey, the way you can live life,
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.520]   and you're gonna know what the objective is,
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.240]   and you can pursue being victorious,
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.680]   is you're gonna take the word of God,
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.600]   and you're gonna read and live according to it,
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.160]   study it, I'm gonna know it, I'm gonna apply it to my life.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.660]   And some of you guys, man, as lovingly as I can say,
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.400]   you're not doing that.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.920]   And you come every week, and you listen to the messages,
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.980]   and you say encouraging, kind things, and I love that.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:05.220]   But you have gotta spend personal time with the Lord,
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:09.440]   reading, studying, and if you are at a place
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.120]   where you're like, man, I read, and I just don't understand,
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.720]   there's so many amazing resources at this church,
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.320]   and ways for you to learn your Bible,
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.440]   and to grow in understanding of how I can live
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.000]   according to God's word, 'cause Paul's saying,
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.360]   if you wanna experience victory,
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:24.040]   man, he lays it out in what it looks like
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.000]   to experience that in this life.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.880]   The final instruction he says is related to prayer.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.400]   He says, and you're praying at all times.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.720]   Man, you wanna be victorious, or in this life,
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.300]   constantly on guard, there's an enemy,
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.440]   I'm gonna live according to the Spirit,
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:44.040]   and I am going to be marked by prayer at all times.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:50.560]   It's the Christian perspective,
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.480]   this constant communication with God,
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.280]   the God who is sovereign over everything,
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.200]   created everything, is all-powerful over everything,
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.000]   the spiritual enemy that I discussed.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.160]   When the Bible describes him,
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.100]   it's not some mutual or even close competition,
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.760]   as though there's the dark side, and the light side,
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.160]   and light eventually wins, but it's really close.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.160]   The Scriptures say that God is,
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.760]   even the name mentioned causes the demonic world to shudder.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.160]   You see Jesus walk on the planet,
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.920]   and demons don't show up and come up to him,
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.820]   and go like, man, let's go, you ready?
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.840]   They fall at his knees, and they say,
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.800]   are you the one, are you here,
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.400]   is it the appointed time to destroy me?
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.040]   I know who you are, the Holy One of God.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.200]   And that same God wants to be intimately involved
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:40.200]   in your life, and wants you to have the ability,
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.840]   and know that you have been invited,
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.080]   and moment by moment, daily, to invite him in
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.960]   to the feelings you're having,
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.600]   to the stress and anxiety that you're facing,
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.740]   to whatever you're walking through,
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.400]   that you would be in constant communication,
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.800]   like a walkie-talkie, God, I'm going in this meeting,
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.520]   and you know the temptations I'm gonna have,
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.560]   and the frustrations and hurt that I carry from this,
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.120]   will you help me to be more like you?
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.400]   Will you help me to forgive that person?
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.840]   Will you help me to speak words
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.440]   like you would have me speak?
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.720]   God, you know that I'm going to this business function,
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:13.140]   and there's gonna be people that are dressed in ways
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.640]   that it's just gonna be such a distraction,
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.440]   and I don't wanna do anything that's gonna dishonor you,
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.240]   will you help me?
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.600]   God, you know what I'm feeling,
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.880]   and the cancer, it's come back,
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.200]   and I'm so overwhelmed, and I don't even know what to do,
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.400]   but I know I can turn to you, will you help me?
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.920]   Will you give me your peace, this constant communication?
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:35.000]   I mentioned a walkie-talkie,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   and I recently, my son had gotten a walkie-talkie
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.720]   like a year ago, which is so fun when you're a kid,
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.980]   I mean, he's like, this is the greatest thing ever,
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:45.560]   so he and I would talk all throughout the house,
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.160]   and he would be like, "Dad, where are you?"
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.720]   And I'm like, "The same place I was four seconds ago,
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.760]   "kitchen with mom, copy."
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.260]   And he would just go through, and he would do that,
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.760]   and eventually his younger sister was like,
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.120]   "Oh, I wanna try it."
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.080]   And she's just, she's out of control anyways,
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.920]   but she's like, "Oh, I'm gonna do it."
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.160]   And she doesn't, she'll hide places,
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.960]   and go like, "Oh, you have to come find me,"
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.640]   but then she'll tell you where she's hiding.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.420]   So she's like, "Okay, I'm gonna go hide,
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.260]   "you gotta come find me.
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.700]   "I'm gonna go hide in the bathroom."
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:13.840]   And she goes in the bathroom,
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.400]   and she gets the walkie-talkie, and she would talk,
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.040]   and I was waiting, I'm like, "I'm not hearing anything."
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.320]   And I would go in, and I went in and checked,
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.920]   and I'm looking there, and she's just talking away.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.120]   She didn't know she needed to push the button.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.680]   That in order for this to work,
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.240]   you just gotta push the button.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.920]   And your heavenly Father has invited you
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.880]   to the level of relationship and intimacy with who,
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.200]   where you can go to him and constantly communicate,
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.280]   but you gotta push the button, so to speak, of prayer.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.440]   And speak, and maybe you're going,
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.280]   "I don't know how to pray."
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.040]   Prayer, if you know how to talk to somebody,
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.080]   you know how to pray.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.280]   And Paul's saying, "Man, you be marked with praying
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.520]   "at all times in the Spirit."
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:03.400]   In conclusion, there is a spiritual war.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:07.360]   We have spiritual weapons, and we have a spiritual enemy.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.520]   But the good news is that we fight in this war,
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:15.520]   but 2,000 years ago, when Jesus gave his life on the cross,
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.440]   the victory was certain and guaranteed.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.360]   And he put an expiration date on death.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.920]   And now we live in this world where we're still battling,
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.080]   and there's a battle taking place,
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.480]   but there is a war that has already been
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.280]   victoriously won by Jesus.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:38.280]   And he is sentenced, Satan, evil, all of it to an end.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.640]   But in the meantime, Paul is saying,
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.200]   "Hey, you can continue to fight and trust.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.620]   "Live according to the Word of God.
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.060]   "Would you be marked by truth?
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.680]   "Have the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.680]   "No shame, no nothing can take that away from you,
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.060]   "because it is given to you by God if you're in Christ.
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.500]   "You would live a life where your confidence
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.000]   "and your mind is shaped and formed
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.440]   "by the reality that you are a child of God."
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.940]   And that victory has been won.
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:09.820]   It's broken and sinful, and so many ways
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.660]   messed up our world is.
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:14.580]   There was a superior work done by Jesus on the cross,
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.440]   Savior.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.120]   I mentioned this Savo story,
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:24.240]   and what ended up happening is after those 135 deaths,
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.060]   they basically said, "Hey, man, we're gonna hit pause
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.960]   "on the railway, 'cause nobody wants to work.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.200]   "They're afraid of losing their life."
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.260]   And the foreman, the guy who was over the construction thing
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.160]   said, "You know what?
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.800]   "We're not gonna wait anymore for these lions to show up
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.200]   "or let this continue to happen.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.800]   "I'm gonna create a trap.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.920]   "I'm gonna set up an environment,
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.880]   "and I'm gonna bring them in, and I'm gonna take them out."
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.120]   And he set up this, basically, a trap that was a setup
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.640]   of having these goats that were already died,
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.440]   and they left them out, and he created, basically,
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:04.440]   a blind up in a tree, and the first lion shows up,
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.640]   and he thinks, "Man, I can see something.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.580]   "I'm gonna go take that and just run outta here
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.800]   "like I have every other time."
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   And they show up, and he goes after the goat,
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.520]   (imitates gun firing)
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:23.120]   that it was a setup, and that lion thought
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:28.120]   he was coming to take, but he was defeated by superior power.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:34.140]   Second thing happens, does the exact same thing,
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.440]   and that enemy that had terrorized and taken life
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.480]   was put to an end and put to death,
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.480]   and in the same way, 2,000 years ago,
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.600]   when Jesus came to the planet, and the Son of God
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.360]   was murdered brutally on a cross made out of wood
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.800]   that he created and held together by the word of his power,
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.760]   crucified and had hands nailed into that wood
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:56.080]   by hands of men that he created and formed and fashioned,
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.000]   and he was raised up and crucified,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.720]   the enemy thought, "Man, I'm bringing evil once again
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:10.940]   "into this world, and the worst day in human history
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:14.920]   "where the Son of God, the perfect Lamb of God
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.760]   "was crucified on a cross, and it looked like death
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.240]   "would win, would days later become the greatest day
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.760]   "in human history because it was a setup."
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.680]   And the enemy intended it for evil,
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.880]   and God took the worst day in human history
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:36.880]   and turned it for good, showing the victory is certain.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.680]   He is one.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.740]   The battle belongs and always has to him,
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.640]   and now as we wait, we make war
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:46.380]   knowing the victory is certain.
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:52.460]   If you've never had a moment where you have trusted in Jesus,
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:56.280]   God's invitation to you is to accept that free gift
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:02.760]   where he died for you, and that looks like just saying,
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.760]   "God, I know I'm a sinner.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.380]   "I receive you as my Savior.
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:09.520]   "Take my life.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.360]   "I trust in you, not in what I do,
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.880]   "but what you've done, dying and rising again."
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.360]   Let me pray.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.600]   Father, thank you that you
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:31.520]   would give your life
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.480]   so that we could spend eternity with you,
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:43.880]   so we could have forgiveness.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.480]   Thank you that there's no force, there's no evil,
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.320]   there's no sin in this room,
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.960]   that you are not
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.360]   eternally more powerful than.
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.800]   And so I pray for everyone as they listen
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.600]   and seek to live that out tomorrow,
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.440]   that they would walk through life
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.920]   putting on the armor of God,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.560]   aware of the enemy around them,
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:14.600]   confident you have been victorious,
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.720]   and we are yours, and now we take your word,
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.320]   and we can live according to it to help us, God.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.820]   In Christ's name, amen.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
