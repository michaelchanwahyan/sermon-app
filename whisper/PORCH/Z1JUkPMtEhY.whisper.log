[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.560]   - Welcome to the porch.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.880]   I'm so glad you made it.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.760]   I know some of you guys are still making your way
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.600]   into the room and you are welcome here.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.440]   And I'm so glad that we get one more time together
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.120]   just to have this moment to celebrate the coming of Emmanuel
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.840]   if this is your first time ever with us at the porch,
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.920]   thanks for trusting us with your Tuesday night.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.040]   We know that there is a lot of places that you could be.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.760]   There's a lot of things that you could be doing
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.720]   on your Tuesday night.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.960]   Some of y'all left work early
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.720]   and you have work to do after this.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.160]   Some of y'all missed dinner
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.440]   and I'm just so glad that you made it tonight.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.240]   As we kind of come to the end of 2023 together
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.680]   and as this is our last time gathering in 2023,
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.680]   we at the porch, we've just been so encouraged
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.720]   as we've looked back on this year
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.080]   to celebrate all God has done.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.040]   Just to share with you and to celebrate with you
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.940]   what God has done here in our lives.
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.320]   We've had four mission trips this year.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.320]   We've had four equipping nights.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.680]   We had the launch retreat.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.520]   Anyone go to launch with us?
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.800]   (congregation cheering)
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.520]   Six porch late nights.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.800]   We have 200 leaders serving with us.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.200]   We have 11 porch live locations
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.060]   around the nation joining us.
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.220]   Let's just celebrate them together.
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.000]   We've got Midland in Tulsa, in Scottsdale,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.240]   in Boise, in Indy, in Greater Lafayette,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.240]   in Des Moines, in Fresno, in Dayton, in Atlanta.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.640]   And we've got people watching in Wheaton.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.400]   And so there are people joining us
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.860]   all over the nation tonight.
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.560]   And so if that's you, we in Dallas are just celebrating
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.400]   (congregation applauding)
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.040]   that you are with us.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.520]   And you might be sitting at home in your apartment
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.440]   or your condo and you're by yourself right now.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.860]   And if you live in Dallas, I would just encourage you,
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.400]   don't spend another Tuesday night alone in 2024.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.340]   You can come and join us here.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.880]   If there is any kids watching right now,
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.720]   we are gonna, parents, you need to know if that's you
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.100]   somehow on the universe.
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.080]   We're about to talk about the secret of Christmas
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.360]   and I would hate to be the one that,
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.920]   I don't wanna be that guy.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.160]   But I'm under the assumption I'm talking
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.640]   to a bunch of young adults right now.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.800]   So that's why this is happening.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.520]   And if you're a young adult that's not in the know,
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.800]   we're about to have a clarifying conversation.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.120]   Several years ago, we went to spend Christmas
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.400]   with my in-laws in Wichita Falls, Texas.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.880]   And on Christmas Eve, we went to First Baptist Church
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.000]   of Wichita Falls where my wife grew up.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.680]   And there was this moment during the service
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.600]   where this pastor who is in his 70s,
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.880]   he invited all of the children in the audience
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.460]   up onto the stage for the Christmas Eve service.
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.680]   So you might have seen this before
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.960]   if you grew up going to church
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.360]   where the pastor might invite children up
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.480]   for the telling of the Christmas story.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.680]   So there are hundreds of kids that come up on the stage.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.920]   Some are brought down by their parents,
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.800]   some are weeping, some kids are on camera
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.320]   picking their nose and their parents are trying to tell them
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.200]   don't do that and that's happening.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.960]   And he brings all these kids up
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.360]   and he sits down in a rocking chair.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.700]   And this was the first thing he said
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.020]   at the Christmas Eve service.
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.300]   The place is packed, the stage is packed
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.300]   with young children expecting for what is going to happen
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.420]   later that night.
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.700]   And here's what he said.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.860]   Looked at all the children, he said,
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.820]   "Now we all know there is no Santa Claus."
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.740]   That's how he started.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.020]   And for the people in the room without kids,
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.520]   we were like, "This is incredible."
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.160]   And for all the moms in the room, they were like,
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.520]   "If you have a shot, take him out."
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.600]   I couldn't believe it, it was amazing.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.180]   What happened that night is that pastor
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.380]   made a massive assumption.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.360]   What was the assumption?
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.940]   His assumption was that everyone was on the same page
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.140]   and everyone was in the know.
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.420]   He assumed that everyone understood everything
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.660]   that was happening surrounding Christmas.
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.020]   And I just wanna say,
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.280]   I don't wanna make the same mistake tonight.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.620]   Like I don't wanna just assume that we all get it.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.740]   I don't wanna assume that we all understand
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.640]   why Christmas is so significant.
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.220]   And so tonight is very, very simple.
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.720]   What I wanna do is I wanna look at the most famous verse
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.960]   in the entire Bible, and I just wanna make sure
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.360]   that we all leave here all in the know.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.200]   So I wanna unpack tonight the reality of the gospel
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.880]   and the right response to the gospel.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.200]   That's it, the reality of the gospel
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.720]   and the right response to the gospel.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.440]   Some of you here have embraced
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.280]   the good news of Christianity for years.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.680]   And if that's you and you just heard what I'm talking about,
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.740]   you might feel like you can tune out now.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.600]   No, no, no, we never get over the gospel.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.680]   And so as I share it,
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.080]   what I hope is birthed in you is just celebration,
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.080]   like a renewed joy in your heart
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.800]   for all Christ has done for you.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.640]   If you're here tonight and you don't know Jesus,
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.680]   then what I hope for you is that you would realize
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.400]   that there is an invitation.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.560]   And then there's some of you
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.560]   who might think you're Christians and you're not,
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.120]   and my hope for you is evaluation.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.080]   So celebration for some, invitation for others,
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.880]   and evaluation for some still more.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.880]   But the goal tonight is that no one leaves here confused,
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.240]   and we're all on the same page.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.540]   So if you have a Bible,
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.280]   you can turn with me to John chapter three
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.400]   as we unpack right here,
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.600]   Christmas at the Porch,
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   as we unpack the most famous verse in your Bible.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.960]   And even if you don't have a Bible,
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.680]   we're gonna have it on the screen, but it's John 3:16.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.500]   Many of you know it, some of y'all have memorized it.
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.800]   Even if you're not a Christian
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.120]   or Christianity is pretty unfamiliar to you,
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.640]   there's a good chance that you are somewhat familiar
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.200]   with John 3:16.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.400]   It says this, it says, "For God so loved the world
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.240]   "that he gave his only son."
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.560]   There's Christmas right there.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.160]   There is God giving a gift to humanity.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.960]   "God so loved the world that he gave his only son,
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.920]   "that whoever believes in him should not perish,
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.480]   "but have eternal life."
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.520]   Here's what makes this verse so incredible.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.600]   Martin Luther, the key figure in the Protestant Reformation,
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.500]   he referred to this one verse as the Bible in miniature.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.400]   Like all of the Bible is summed up in this one verse.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.080]   This is the verse that 94 million people Googled
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:50.080]   when Tim Tebow wrote John 3:16 under his eyes
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.320]   back when he was playing college football.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.040]   It's that significant of a verse.
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.460]   Like this verse encapsulates, it provides the reason
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.100]   why we do what we do at the porch every Tuesday night.
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.300]   Because God so loved the world that he gave his only son,
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.760]   that whoever believes in him should not perish,
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.300]   but have eternal life.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.200]   So first I just wanna unpack for you
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.060]   the reality of the gospel.
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.140]   When I use the word gospel, gospel simply means good news.
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.860]   So I'm just sharing with you the reality
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.580]   of the good news of Christianity.
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.980]   And I wanna do it by just breaking this verse down
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.020]   phrase by phrase.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.940]   It starts by saying for God.
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.220]   The good news of Christianity, it always starts with God.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.060]   We are talking about the king of the universe.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.460]   We're talking about the creator and sustainer of all things.
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.460]   We are talking about your maker and my maker.
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.700]   If you are a Christian and you share your testimony
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.400]   with someone else, make sure that you don't start
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.140]   your testimony with the fact that you are a sinner.
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.240]   That's not where the good news starts.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.940]   The good news always starts with God.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.100]   It always starts with God.
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.740]   And the good news doesn't start
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.400]   with Jesus Christ on the cross.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.780]   It starts with God in the garden of Eden with humanity.
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:18.300]   Even before that when he spoke the universe into creation,
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.460]   but then he created man and woman in the garden
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:26.460]   and he created us to know him, to live with him,
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.820]   to experience intimacy with him, to see him face to face.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.820]   And yet that is not a reality for us
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.820]   because sin entered the hearts of the first humans,
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.900]   our ancestors, Adam and Eve.
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.020]   And they believed alive that there is more joy
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.060]   and more life and more fulfillment
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.820]   to be experienced outside of God's will.
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:53.820]   And when they gave themselves over to rebellion against God,
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.420]   this world was broken.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.420]   It was fractured.
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.220]   And so this world is no longer how it should be.
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.540]   And the same is true with you and me.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:07.120]   There is a bent in our hearts toward rebellion against God.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.720]   The good news of Christianity, it always starts with God.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.540]   God making us for relationship with him.
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:18.540]   It says, "For God so loved the world."
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.820]   So let's just be clear.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.180]   The good news of Christianity, it is a message of God's love.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.060]   That's what Christianity is about.
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.460]   Christianity is about the love of God.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.060]   It is not first and foremost about rules to follow.
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.300]   It's not first and foremost about what political party
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.700]   to align yourself with.
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.260]   Christianity at the foundational level
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:45.260]   hinges on the love of God.
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.980]   And this actually shows us the extent of God's love
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.900]   because it says that God so loved the world.
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.740]   Jews that would have been hearing this
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.100]   would have been shocked to hear it
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:05.500]   because Jews knew that God loved the children of Israel.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.140]   And yet now what they're finding out
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.340]   is that God's love can actually reach anyone.
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.820]   For God so loved the world that he did what?
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.940]   He gave, that's Christmas.
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.100]   It's when gifts are given.
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.820]   God gave the gift of his one and only son.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.100]   This shows the intensity of God's love.
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.620]   See, the Greek word kosmos,
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.340]   which has been translated world,
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.500]   when it says that God so loved the world,
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.180]   world in the book of John is usually used
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.060]   to refer to a rebellious humanity.
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.020]   It's a reference to those people
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.900]   who were living in rebellion against God.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.180]   And so what this shows is the intensity of God's love,
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.940]   that a world filled with humans
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.500]   who throughout all ages would rebel against God
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.860]   have been given a gift by the God
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.300]   that they're rebelling against.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.820]   And what did God give?
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.900]   God gave his one and only son.
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:06.780]   If you think about it, when people disagree with us,
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.580]   if people don't accept us, what's our normal response?
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.300]   Our response is to cancel them.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.900]   If they don't agree with us, accept us,
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.180]   approve of us, we cancel them.
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:22.020]   We didn't approve of, embrace, accept, acknowledge God.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.020]   And what did God do?
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.020]   He gave his one and only son for us.
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.820]   He gave the best of him to his enemies.
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:37.260]   This also just shows the generosity of God
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.460]   because it says that God gave his one and only son,
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.820]   which is so interesting.
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.020]   Don't miss what I'm telling you right now.
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:49.020]   Before God asks anything of us, he gave.
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.420]   He gave.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.340]   Before he asks anything of us, he gave.
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.460]   I would imagine, and I hope
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.820]   that there are people here right now
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.300]   who hear that God gave and something in you is like,
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.420]   when has God given anything to me?
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.940]   Some of you might be frustrated at God.
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.300]   Some of you might be severely disappointed in God.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.260]   Some of you might be very skeptical of God
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.540]   because you're looking at God thinking,
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.540]   what have you ever done for me?
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.940]   And if that's you, let me just tell you
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.380]   what might be happening in your life.
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:28.380]   What might be happening is you might be confusing
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:33.420]   what you need now with what you need most.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.940]   You might be frustrated at God
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:41.540]   because he hasn't given you what you need now.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.900]   You need physical healing.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.980]   You need physical healing for your loved one.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.860]   You need a boyfriend or girlfriend or a spouse
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.580]   so that you won't be lonely anymore.
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.500]   You need something financially to change.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.100]   You need something to happen in your job.
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.580]   You need something to happen just in your life
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.340]   so that you can feel more settled,
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.180]   more at peace, more happy.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.260]   And you don't feel like God has shown up
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.940]   and given you what you believe you need now.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.900]   And it's not that he can't,
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.980]   and it's not that he doesn't show up
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.860]   in very meaningful and miraculous ways in people's lives,
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.300]   but let's just be clear,
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.700]   don't confuse what you need now with what you need most.
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.700]   Because God sent his one and only son,
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:36.460]   watch this, that whoever, whoever, whoever.
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.820]   What that means is that the invitation is to all.
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.020]   If you're hearing this message right now, it is for you.
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.740]   It is God's generosity and motion toward you.
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:53.300]   Whoever believes, whoever believes,
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.100]   not whoever lives a good enough life,
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.660]   not whoever attends church regularly,
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:02.580]   not whoever votes for the right political party,
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:07.580]   no, whoever believes in him, in Jesus,
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.020]   not in the God of your choosing,
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:14.740]   not just in some abstract substance in the sky,
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.740]   not in a spiritual force, but in Jesus Christ,
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.860]   whoever believes in him, watch this, shall not perish.
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.220]   See, that's why I'm talking about
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:30.420]   not confusing what you need now with what you need most.
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:35.620]   Because what you and I need most is a savior.
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.900]   And you might be like, I don't need a savior.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.860]   I am crushing life.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.940]   Some of you are and way to go, man, congratulations.
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.900]   I'm so glad it's working out for you.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.600]   But you need a savior and I need a savior
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.740]   because here is the reality.
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.820]   No one is born right with God.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:02.140]   Everyone is born separate from God.
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:06.020]   Every person is deserving of eternal separation
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.680]   from God in hell.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.700]   And yet God in his love has sent his son
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:16.700]   so that whoever would believe in him shall not perish.
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.260]   That's the beauty of Christmas.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.860]   That's the beauty of Christianity.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:24.000]   That's the good news that when we deserve to perish,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.660]   meaning when we deserve to spend eternity
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:31.660]   separated from God in hell, God did something miraculous.
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.740]   And Jesus Christ has come into the world
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.660]   to seek and save the lost.
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:40.460]   Now, let me just correct some unfortunate theology.
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:44.500]   Some people want to believe that if God is truly loving,
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.180]   then how could he ever send anyone to hell?
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.180]   Like if God truly loves everyone,
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.500]   how could he send anyone to hell?
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.460]   Well, here's what you have to remember.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:59.280]   If God is perfect and he is going to be both just
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.320]   and loving, then you have to deal with that.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:09.120]   Like we all want God, we all want love.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.680]   We all want God's love for us in our family,
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.680]   but then we want God's justice for the evil out there.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:22.880]   But if God is going to execute justice,
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.080]   he's going to have to do it against all evil,
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.460]   including the evil in my heart and the evil in your heart.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:35.280]   And so we have to understand that if God were to just close
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.800]   his eyes for five seconds and be like,
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.800]   "Everyone just get into heaven.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.700]   "Like, I'm not going to look.
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.140]   "You just get in there, all right?
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.140]   "You go, you go.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.480]   "I don't care what you've done.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.800]   "I don't want to look at it for a minute.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.580]   "Just go right in."
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.600]   How unjust would that be?
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:58.000]   For him to turn a blind eye, that would make him unjust.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.920]   In the person of Jesus, God is able to maintain his justice.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:08.880]   That sin experiences the wrath of God.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:15.920]   The wrath of God for sin is poured out,
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.920]   but instead of it being poured out on you and me,
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.320]   it's poured out on Jesus Christ, God himself.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.520]   He maintains his justice.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:30.240]   And yet his justice is paired with his love.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.320]   That instead of experiencing his wrath,
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.160]   we experience his love.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.040]   Whoever believes in him shall not perish,
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.520]   but have eternal life.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.320]   Do you know what eternal life is?
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.760]   You might be thinking eternal life is just
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.120]   where you get to spend eternity.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.160]   It's like, it's heaven.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.040]   It's going to heaven.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:55.040]   Eternal life isn't primarily about where,
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.520]   it's about who.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:01.680]   It's not as much about where you go,
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.800]   but about who you get to be with.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.680]   Yes, when you know Jesus,
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:11.160]   you will spend eternity in heaven,
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:17.840]   but heaven isn't the prize, Jesus is.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.920]   Eternal life in the presence of God
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.280]   is what you and I have been made for.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.680]   And here's the good news.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.880]   Eternal life doesn't begin the day you die.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.520]   It begins the day that you believe in him.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.280]   The day that you believe in Jesus is the day
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.160]   that you get to begin experiencing life with God
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:45.160]   that begins today and lasts for all of eternity.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.480]   So that's the reality of the gospel.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.280]   Let's just all be on the same page.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.760]   This is what the good news of Christianity is about,
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.000]   that when we were sinners,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.680]   when we were deserving of eternal separation from God,
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.680]   God loved the world, rebellious humanity,
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.720]   so much that he sent his son that whoever believes in him
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.440]   shall not perish, but have eternal life.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.040]   So that's the reality of the gospel.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.400]   So now we just need to talk about
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.260]   what's the right response to the gospel.
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.840]   Have you had the right response to the gospel?
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.080]   John 3:16 says that the right response is to believe,
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.960]   that whoever believes in him should not perish,
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.040]   but have eternal life.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.040]   But here's what we need to make sure that we're all clear on
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.320]   is that there is a right belief and a wrong belief.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.920]   There is a belief that doesn't save
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.520]   and there is a belief that does save.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.520]   If that's confusing to you,
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.240]   let me just inform you about the belief that doesn't save.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.280]   We see it in the Bible, in the book of John.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.920]   Listen to John 8:31.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.500]   It says, "Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him."
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.320]   So he's talking to people who had believed,
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.180]   but then he talks to the same group of people
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.440]   and listen to what he says.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.820]   In verse 42, Jesus said,
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:02.940]   "If God were your father, you would love me."
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.860]   And then in verse 44, he says,
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.400]   "You are of your father, the devil."
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.180]   That's kind of harsh.
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.420]   You know who your dad is, the devil.
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:18.180]   Okay, nice to meet you too.
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.500]   Like that's kind of like, tell me how you really feel.
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.420]   You know, like he says, "You're of your father, the devil,
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.840]   "and your will is to do your father's desires."
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.820]   Do you see the connection here?
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.280]   There is a belief that doesn't save.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.940]   So what does a saving belief look like?
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:41.940]   Well, the word here is the Greek word, pistou.
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.660]   Which means to be persuaded that something is true,
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.420]   to trust, to rely upon, to derive confidence in.
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.020]   So my question to you is not just have you come
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.380]   to a place where you're convinced mentally
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.060]   of what I'm telling you about,
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:00.340]   but have you come to a point where you have been
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:05.340]   so convinced that you have trusted your life with Jesus,
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:09.380]   that you have put your confidence in Jesus?
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.520]   I've said this before,
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.900]   but the best way I can explain it is this,
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.820]   is the nature of a gift should determine
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.620]   the nature of your response.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.720]   So on Christmas day, when you receive presents from people,
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.800]   the nature of the gift should determine
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.780]   the nature of your response.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.900]   I'll illustrate it this way,
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.360]   I've illustrated it this way in a similar way before,
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.940]   but if this was my present to you,
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.140]   and you, I might give this to one of you tonight,
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.400]   you might get, this might be a really great gift.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.860]   If you were to unwrap this,
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:48.860]   and I were to give you tonight a picture of my wife and me,
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:53.240]   anyone want this, anyone interested?
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.920]   Merry Christmas, this is my gift to you,
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.120]   I just ask that you hang it up for at least a year.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.180]   That's all I ask.
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.640]   But I want you to think about this,
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.940]   what do you do with a picture?
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:11.580]   You hang it, and you forget it.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:15.900]   That's it, like the extent of your relationship
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.980]   with this picture is to put it up and never touch it again,
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.020]   until you trade it out for something else.
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.560]   The nature of the gift determines the nature of the response
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.380]   like you take this, you hang it up, you forget about it,
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.460]   your relationship is pretty passive with this picture.
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.040]   Sometimes you might notice it,
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.100]   you might get to the point where you never notice it.
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:42.100]   But if I were to give you my cell phone,
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:46.380]   or if you were to get a cell phone for Christmas,
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.100]   like the nature of the gift
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.660]   should determine the nature of your response.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.100]   If I were to give you a phone,
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.700]   and you're like, "Oh my gosh, thank you so much,
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.500]   "I've been needing a new coaster, thank you,
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.820]   "that just means the world."
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.820]   Or you were like, "You know what, this table's wobbly."
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.180]   And you were to jam it under there,
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.160]   you're like, "Man, that is such a great
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.160]   "thousand dollar table leveler, I am so grateful for you."
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.440]   Or if you left it in the box and never took it out,
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.700]   that wouldn't make sense.
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.720]   The nature of the gift should determine
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.360]   the nature of the response.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.480]   It is a phone, and this thing is supposed to change
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.040]   the way you interact with the world.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.120]   You take it out of the box, you turn it on,
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:30.120]   you enter your Apple ID, you download certain apps,
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:34.440]   like you use it to connect with the rest of the world.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:39.680]   All throughout the day, every day.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.700]   The nature of the gift should determine
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:43.840]   the nature of the response.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.680]   So what is the nature of the gift that God has given to us?
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:53.540]   Well, it's his son, it is God in the flesh,
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:58.120]   who was a sacrifice and a substitute for our sin.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.400]   He went to war with Satan, sin and death, and won.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.400]   He triumphed over our sin.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.840]   He ascended into heaven,
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.960]   he is seated at the right hand of God, he is alive,
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.080]   he is ruling and reigning as king.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.160]   He has sent his spirit into our lives
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.880]   to live inside of us through faith,
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.440]   and to make us more like Jesus.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.840]   And he gives us eternal life.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.720]   My hope is that there's people here tonight
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.320]   who just heard everything I just said,
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.160]   and you're like, "Ah, you lost me."
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:36.160]   Like, that was confusing, that was too much.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.560]   And we would love for you to come down front afterward,
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.660]   and we'd love to explain it further,
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.480]   but if it felt overwhelming or confusing,
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.120]   that's kind of the point, a little bit,
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.400]   to say, "Hey, it's so much more than a picture frame.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.580]   "It's so much more than a picture where, you know what,
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:58.000]   "we read this verse that God loved the world,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.840]   "that he gave his son, that whoever believes in him,"
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.840]   and we're like, "Yeah, I believe.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.460]   "Let me just put my belief on the wall,
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.700]   "and I'll just hang it there, and never use it again."
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.280]   And your relationship with God
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.640]   is just a passive relationship
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.360]   that you're thankful that it's there,
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.960]   but you don't really need it to do anything for you.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.680]   And so my question is,
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.080]   do you relate to God more like a picture or a phone?
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.560]   Let me ask you this.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.980]   I want you to think about this.
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.060]   How different would your life be without your phone?
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.380]   Would your life be different?
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.980]   Raise your hand if you think your life
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.780]   would change a little bit if you didn't have a phone.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.620]   Okay.
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.580]   How different would your life be
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:46.140]   without a picture you have in a frame somewhere?
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.240]   Some of y'all might be like, "You know what?
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.740]   "I have an emotional attachment to that picture."
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.260]   Most of you would be like,
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.540]   "I don't have pictures, I have posters."
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.780]   Okay, well, just, that's for the men in the room.
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:04.740]   Someday a woman is gonna change your life
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.920]   and your aesthetics.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.340]   But I bet your life wouldn't change much
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.380]   if that picture was never, was removed from your life.
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.260]   Here's my question.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:21.180]   How different would your life be if Jesus wasn't in it?
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.960]   (soft music)
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.860]   Would your life be different at all?
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:32.840]   Some of y'all might say, "Jesus is everything for me."
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:38.560]   Some of y'all might say, "My life is staked on Jesus.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:43.400]   "I am leveraging my life for the sake of the gospel."
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.880]   Others of you might be having this realization
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.080]   that you've identified under the banner of Christianity,
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.900]   but the reality is that you just have
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.560]   kind of a passive relationship,
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.840]   that Jesus is information that you have acknowledged
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.800]   in your head, but you've never trusted in him.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.580]   You've never put your confidence in him.
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.240]   And others of you, for the first time,
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.320]   are just realizing what Jesus has done,
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.300]   that he has died and that he has risen
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.000]   from the dead victoriously to take those
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.200]   who are far from God and to bring you
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.920]   into a right relationship with God.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:25.920]   So this just comes to the question, how will you respond?
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:30.720]   Three options for some of you tonight.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.780]   The response is just celebration.
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.320]   Tonight, you're just being reminded
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.080]   of the goodness of the gospel,
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.900]   who God is, what he's done for you
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.120]   in the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.980]   So as we sing in just a moment, sing with all your heart,
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.960]   center your mind and heart on the person of Jesus,
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.100]   let joy fill your heart and let it overflow
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.600]   in celebration toward him.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.280]   For others of you, there's an invitation on the table.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:02.200]   You've just tonight gained clarity
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.200]   that you need Jesus in your life.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.060]   And if that's you, there's an invitation on the table.
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.500]   And then others of you, it's evaluation.
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.920]   It's just evaluating.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.580]   Hey, you've lived under the banner of Christianity,
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.300]   but have you had the right response to Jesus?
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.060]   And if something in you is coming to the realization
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.280]   that you've never really trusted in him,
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:32.280]   well, then that moves you from evaluation to invitation.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.640]   Let's pray together.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.560]   And if that's you, and tonight you wanna invite Jesus
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:48.560]   into your life, you just are realizing for the first time
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.700]   that you want Jesus, you need Jesus,
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.960]   you want him to be your savior.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.380]   If that's you, would you just put up your hand real quick
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.260]   with eyes closed so I know exactly
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.260]   who I'm talking to in this place?
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:04.440]   If that's you, I just wanna encourage you right now.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.900]   There's no magic rabbit's foot prayer to pray.
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:11.900]   I'm just trying to give you words to tell to your maker.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.480]   You can just say these words.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.440]   Just say, Lord Jesus, would you come into my life tonight?
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:23.240]   Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.720]   Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.880]   Would you come into my life?
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.840]   Would you forgive me of my sin?
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.160]   And would you begin to lead me in a new life?
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:46.140]   And if you're here tonight,
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:52.620]   and you just need to celebrate what God's done
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.980]   in your heart, then we're gonna respond by singing now.
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.860]   If you need to stay seated and continue to evaluate
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.200]   and process, you can.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.720]   If you need to talk to someone, if you're like,
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.180]   man, I need clarity now.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:07.980]   I need somebody that can help me figure things out.
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.700]   If you need to talk to someone,
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.740]   there's gonna be some people that are standing down front
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.000]   in the corners, and we'd love to talk to you.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.420]   But I'm just gonna pray, and then we're gonna
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.600]   respond to God now.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.500]   Lord Jesus, thank you.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.980]   We praise you.
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.920]   We love you.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.620]   You are a great savior and a great king.
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.980]   And so we worship and respond to you now.
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.760]   In Jesus' name, amen.
