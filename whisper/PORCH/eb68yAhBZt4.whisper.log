[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:13.600]   - All right, let's go.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.620]   Hey, welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.720]   friends in El Paso, Fort Worth, Dallas,
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.040]   excited Front Row, Houston, Rogers, Arkansas,
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.240]   wherever you were tuning in and joining us from,
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.400]   we are excited to continue this series.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.580]   Hey, any fans of the show "Tidying Up" right now?
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.700]   Man, I love it.
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.300]   Yeah, Marie Kondo.
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.120]   So for those of you who've never heard about it,
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.780]   let me tell a story that'll give us some direction
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.780]   for where we're going tonight.
[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.680]   A friend of mine recently suggested that,
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.660]   a girl who works on staff, she was like,
[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.340]   "Hey, you guys need to watch this show."
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.640]   And was telling us about it.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.080]   It's essentially, it's like the reverse of "Hoarders."
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.960]   If you've ever seen "Hoarders," this is a show,
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.120]   "Hoarders" where you like keep everything,
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.760]   this is a show where the woman goes into your house,
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.420]   basically helps you kind of like,
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.240]   "Hey, let's get rid of this stuff."
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.240]   And it's got like a cult following right now around it.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.760]   To the point where if you are watching it,
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.600]   you're probably like,
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.840]   "That's not exactly what the show's about."
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.880]   And, but it pretty much is.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.920]   And so I was like, "Yeah, okay, we need a new show.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.920]   We'll watch that, turn it on."
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.400]   Let me give you a couple interesting facts
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.280]   in case you ever go watch it.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.960]   Number one, Marie only speaks Japanese,
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.980]   which is interesting and was a curve ball.
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.840]   So she's in America and she goes around
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.360]   and she's like basically with her translator,
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.880]   she's telling you, "Hey, this is what you need to do.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.280]   Take these things out, move these."
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.000]   And she's got all these different step-by-step things
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.400]   to clean up your house.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.960]   And I can't exactly endorse it or any of it,
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.080]   but I was a little bit surprised, like just funny things.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.400]   Like you talk to the clothes.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.320]   You're like, "Thank you for what you were a part of my life
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.320]   in this season."
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.380]   And the way you evaluate whether you want to keep
[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.920]   different clothes or items is like,
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.480]   "Hey, does this thing bring you joy or spark joy?
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.480]   Or is this something that is a part of my past?
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.960]   Or do I want this to come into the future?"
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.480]   So we were like, "Hey, one thing it does definitely do
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.920]   is it gets you in kind of the spring cleaning kick."
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.120]   So of course my wife and I began to go through things
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.360]   and immediately recognized how many things we have,
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.160]   either that we didn't know that we have,
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.980]   or how many things that we were holding onto from the past
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.640]   that probably had no place in our future.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.240]   For example, cargo shorts,
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.040]   probably not something anybody needs to hold onto.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.960]   So I'm like going through and I'm like,
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.880]   I mean, really you've got to realize how much you have.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.620]   I had a pair of binoculars that I've had since 15.
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.600]   I've never used them,
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.000]   but you kind of always hold onto stuff
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.480]   'cause you're like, "Well, what if I take up
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.840]   birdwatching someday?
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.040]   Or I'm going to need these."
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.320]   Or, you know, going through old clothes
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.140]   and it's like pearl snaps, this probably has to go.
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.000]   Or just things that no longer fit anymore.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.580]   And so it was a revelation to us of just how many things
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.540]   from our past that we were still holding onto
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.160]   that we didn't realize we were carrying
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.440]   into our future unknowingly.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.380]   And what does that have to do
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.000]   with what we're talking about tonight?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.160]   We're continuing a series called Self-Care,
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.700]   where we explore what the Bible says
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.420]   about caring for yourself.
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.460]   Self-care is a cultural term right now that's popular
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.980]   and related to, you know, people under the banner
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.400]   of self-care will do all kinds of things,
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.360]   whether it is participate in retail therapy,
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.620]   or, "Hey, I just need to go to the mall
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.680]   'cause it's been a hard week."
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.620]   Or, "I need a margarita."
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.180]   Or, "Hey, I need to go on a diet."
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.260]   It's kind of like anything that you want
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.460]   that you think would be good for you
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.740]   fits into the bucket of self-care.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.080]   That's what the world says.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.120]   But biblically, self-care is not like that,
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.080]   but there is things that God says,
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.800]   in order for you to be a healthy person
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.220]   in mind, body, and spirit,
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.900]   these are things that should mark your life.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.320]   So we've been exploring that
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.380]   and are spending the next really handful of weeks
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.380]   exploring what does it look like in 2019
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.260]   for you to be all that God wants for you to be,
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.360]   for you to experience increased health
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.500]   as it relates to your mind, as it relates to your body,
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.500]   as it relates to your spirit.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.180]   And tonight, we are gonna talk through
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.540]   the idea of cleaning out the closet,
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.260]   if you will, of your soul.
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.380]   Because just like in that scenario,
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.100]   where there's things inside of our closet
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.080]   that we stumble across and we're like,
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.420]   "Man, I didn't realize I still had this from high school
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.660]   that we're carrying around."
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.260]   There are things in all of our lives
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.540]   that if you don't intentionally go through your life,
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.360]   you didn't just pick up that shirt from high school
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.200]   you're still carrying around,
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.500]   you picked up wounds and hurts
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.740]   from that friend who betrayed you in high school
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.140]   that you're still carrying around.
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.100]   And not just hurts, there's also just habits,
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.120]   or we call them hangups, or sins,
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.240]   that at some point along our journey in life,
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.220]   all of us are either exposed to
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.620]   or sins committed against us.
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.700]   And if we're not diligent to clean those things out,
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.940]   to work through those, we will carry those items
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.060]   or those things from our past into the future.
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.180]   It looks like being exposed to pornography
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.660]   in the seventh grade, and all of a sudden,
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.860]   that begins to feed something, and you carried it.
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.100]   Maybe you're still carrying it.
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.220]   It looks like being sexually abused,
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.740]   and just kind of along the journey of life,
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.620]   and it wasn't your fault, and somebody made a decision,
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.060]   and it was wrong, and it was evil.
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.980]   But if you and I are not careful to deal with the hurts
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.780]   and things done to us and things that we've done,
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.780]   you're gonna carry those items into your future,
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.580]   whether you want to or not.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.180]   And so tonight, we're gonna discuss what it looks like
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.100]   to diligently clean out the closet, if you will,
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.580]   of your soul, to make sure that you're not carrying things
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.100]   from your past into the future,
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.720]   because if you do not deal with that,
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.140]   if you don't deal with hurts, sins,
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.420]   and things from your past in the present,
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.340]   you will carry them into the future.
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.860]   It is a guarantee.
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.740]   And so we're gonna look at what God's Word says
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.820]   about how we can experience freedom
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.740]   from some of the hurts and sins that have marked our life.
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.020]   So we're gonna look at three principles.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.340]   If you take notes, you can label this talk
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.620]   cleaning out the closet,
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.860]   or cleaning out the closet of your soul.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.260]   We're gonna look at three principles
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.920]   and three practical things from God's Word.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.220]   Three principles as it relates to experiencing
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.180]   a healthier you at a spiritual level,
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.860]   and three practical steps in light of those three principles.
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.700]   So we're gonna dive right in.
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.780]   The first principle that we're gonna look at
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.980]   comes from Proverbs 28.
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.620]   It's really all throughout the Bible.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.820]   But Proverbs 28, verse 13, it says this.
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.820]   "Whoever conceals or hides their sins does not prosper,
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.700]   "but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy."
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.300]   The first idea that Solomon tells us in Proverbs 28, 13
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.580]   is repeated all throughout the Bible,
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.420]   which is essentially whatever we conceal will not heal.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.340]   That way that I said it was,
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.340]   hey, the principle is that God cannot heal
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.260]   whatever we hide.
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.200]   There are things in your life,
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.720]   some in the present, some in the past,
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.940]   and if you are hiding them,
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.300]   you are basically saying,
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.620]   God, I do not want you to heal this arena of my life.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.660]   Some of you are carrying around
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.100]   a secret addiction to pornography,
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.260]   and you would say it's not an addiction,
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.740]   but I pretty much look at it every day,
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.060]   and you will not be healed
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.420]   as long as you hide or conceal that.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.300]   Some of you are carrying an eating disorder,
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.020]   and no one knows, and you're committed to no one knows.
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.700]   And you think, man, I'm probably just gonna die
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.460]   with this, I don't know that I could tell anyone.
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.740]   Others of you, there was sexual abuse in your past.
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.340]   Maybe you carry the shame of an abortion.
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.180]   I don't know what it is for you, but I do know
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.880]   the Bible says whatever you hide, God cannot heal.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.740]   That whatever we decide to hide or conceal from Him
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.540]   is something we are saying,
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.860]   God, I do not give you access to healing this.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.740]   You're carrying an addiction to drugs or pain medication,
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.180]   and you're doing it all alone,
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.420]   and you're afraid, what if other people knew?
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.780]   And there's an enemy called Satan who is feeding you
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.140]   the lie that you can't tell anybody,
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.240]   you need to fight or you need to suffer in isolation alone.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.400]   Because if people really knew the real you,
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.860]   they'd reject the real you, and it's a lie.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.600]   And the God who's there says, I'm inviting you
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.820]   to experience the cure, which we already read,
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.140]   but as James says further to punctuate it,
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.200]   is this, is confession.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   He says this in James 5, verse 16.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.520]   Therefore, confess your sins to each other
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.960]   and pray for one another so that you may be healed.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.960]   The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.180]   That the Bible teaches that the solution,
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.240]   that the cure, the first step in cleaning out
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.440]   the closet or the soul in your life involves confession.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.800]   Because whatever the principle is,
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.360]   whatever you hide, God cannot heal.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.800]   And as long as you keep that a secret,
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.680]   you will hide or you will not experience
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.060]   the healing of God in your life.
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.700]   But if you will confess it, which means what?
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.600]   Not talking just to God, it says confessing to one another.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.920]   It means talking to people, bringing it out into the light.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.720]   God says that along with prayer,
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.480]   you will begin to experience the cure,
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.040]   that confession is the cure.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.640]   And he's inviting you, if you wanna experience healing,
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.120]   it's not gonna happen the day that you wake up
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.200]   and you're like, I just don't wanna be depressed anymore.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.860]   The first step is when you begin to expose it to the light,
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.120]   you begin to bring it into the light with other people,
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.640]   other believers or Christians inside of your life.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.220]   But as long as you hide it,
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.060]   you delay healing in that area.
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.320]   I have a friend who, when I went to college,
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.760]   we one day went out to this lake
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.080]   that was called Lake Bryan, which is near College Station.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.400]   And, you know, whoop.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.280]   And we were out there and hanging out for the day
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.520]   and he had to go to the bathroom.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.800]   And we were kinda out of this like lake park
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.240]   and there wasn't really bathrooms around.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.780]   And so he was like, hey, I'm gonna go to the bathroom
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.560]   over here, went out into the woods
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.720]   and he didn't have to go number one.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.080]   So you may see where this is going.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.760]   And so he goes and he, you know, uses leaves.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.400]   And then later that night, you know,
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.160]   kinda everything's fine, go back to the day
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.800]   and go home and he was a roommate.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.760]   Or we lived in the same house.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.840]   And that night he woke up and he was covered
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.600]   in a poison oak rash.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.800]   I know, man.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.380]   And here's the fun fact about poison oak
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.320]   and poison ivy, in case this is just free.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.120]   In order for it to heal, it has to be exposed to the light
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.400]   and out in the open.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.280]   And the longer that it is covered up with clothes,
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.760]   it will not heal.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.880]   And so that's a really tricky area.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.800]   He's essentially wearing a diaper of poison oak around him.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.440]   And that's a really tricky area to keep out in the open
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.160]   'cause we are not on National Geographic in Africa
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.000]   or something.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.480]   And so what does that mean?
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.480]   It means that for weeks, he had a poison oak rash
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.400]   that covered him where he would essentially go to class
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.660]   and then he would come home and he would take a bath
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.800]   because whatever you hide cannot heal
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.440]   or delays the healing in there.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.840]   And that guy was this guy.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.040]   And, I know.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.680]   Just didn't want us to go there.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.600]   Still don't.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.640]   But I learned a valuable lesson
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.680]   as I experienced this firsthand,
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.480]   that if you don't expose to the light and to the open,
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.920]   poison oak, it, like sin, is not going away
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.840]   and will not heal.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.720]   And here's where this really is true for you.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.800]   If you do not expose the areas of your life
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.760]   where you are struggling,
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.880]   you are going to not heal from them.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.400]   You will not.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.280]   If you don't have other people
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.560]   that you are opening up your mouth and honestly saying,
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.840]   hey, this is the area where I'm really struggling right now.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.960]   I don't know what it is in your life.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.680]   Maybe it's anxiety.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.780]   And whether or not anxiety is a sin or directly
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.160]   or what does that look like, it's a part of a fallen world.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.440]   And I do know you weren't meant to walk alone
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.140]   in the midst of that anxiety.
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.640]   And there is an enemy who wants to tell you the lie
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.920]   that you can't tell anybody this.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.480]   You're the only one who has same sex attraction.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.240]   You're the only person here that had an abortion.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.480]   If they really knew what you, who you really are,
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.000]   they wouldn't even let you in here.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.920]   And it's a lie.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.680]   Feeds you lies like, man, what are they gonna think
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.880]   if I tell them?
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.440]   Let me tell you what they're gonna think.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.940]   If you come and you open up about, man,
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.160]   this part of my life, here's what they're gonna think.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.720]   You're really honest and you're a lot like them,
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.680]   only more honest.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.940]   That's what they're gonna think.
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.000]   That all of us come into this room and we're all broken
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.280]   and we all have problems.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.320]   And if you walked into this room
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.000]   and everyone looks pretty like they have it all together,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.880]   we're all on a journey here.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.000]   Nobody, hey, I just woke up like this.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.200]   That doesn't exist in the church.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.600]   And if the body of Christ can't be open
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.600]   about the areas where we are struggling,
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.760]   what group on the planet can?
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.880]   And so here's the invitation.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.280]   If you wanna experience healing
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.520]   or cleaning out at a soul level,
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.120]   if you wanna be all that God wants for you to be,
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.280]   not just today, but going forward,
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.480]   you have got to tell someone.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.860]   And so tonight, grab a trusted Christian.
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.900]   Grab someone that you believe.
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.900]   Sometimes I feel like we're like,
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.440]   hey, you gotta live openly and we give the impression
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.520]   that, hey, here's what we want you to do.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.400]   Every one of you line up, we're all going up on stage,
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.280]   you gotta tell everybody everything.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.320]   That's not what I'm saying.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.820]   I'm inviting you, tell one person.
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.160]   Start there.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.160]   Share with your community group.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.000]   That would be awesome.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.320]   But if you're like, that's too much for me,
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.360]   take a baby step.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.560]   I dare you, tell one person.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.720]   Tell a trusted believer.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.080]   If you're like, I don't know any trusted followers of Jesus,
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.800]   we'll have an entire team up down front after this message
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.520]   that would love to come alongside and pray for you.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.460]   And you're like, what are they gonna think if I share that?
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.680]   They're gonna think you're honest
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.080]   and you actually want to get well.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.480]   That's what they're gonna think.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.640]   And the God who's there is crazy about you.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.060]   He loves you so much that he would give his own life for you
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.320]   and there's an enemy who's telling you,
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.240]   you need to carry this alone and he's saying, I love you.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.840]   I want you to experience healing,
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.920]   not 'cause I'm angry at you, because I love you.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.760]   And the choice is yours.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.600]   Are you gonna experience or allow the only cure
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.560]   that we're told, prayer and confession,
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.520]   from another person to come into your life
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.960]   to breathe and begin to breathe healing
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.480]   or are you gonna hold it alone and just let it grow
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.880]   because what you hide does not heal
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.040]   and what we hide, God cannot heal.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.000]   So the first principle is what we hide, God can't heal
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.280]   and the first practical is that you've got to reveal.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.760]   All the practicals come with an R,
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.920]   so this should be really easy tonight.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.880]   You've got to reveal it.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.380]   You've got to reveal it to someone else in your life.
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.600]   This changed my life.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.680]   I remember in college, around that same time,
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.600]   there was a guy who came in and busted into my house
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.560]   and he basically said, hey, take this phone.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.480]   I did it again, I looked at pornography
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.200]   and I don't want to be this man anymore
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.300]   and I'd never seen someone be that honest.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.400]   And you know what I did?
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.440]   I slammed the door and said, get out of here.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.560]   No, of course I didn't do that.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.660]   That was entirely a joke.
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.600]   I said, oh my gosh, me too.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.440]   And I don't wanna be this man
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.560]   and it was the very first time
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.360]   that I began to experience healing around pornography
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.380]   because confession is not just a cure, it's contagious.
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.560]   And when we open up our lives,
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.320]   it breathes health not just into us but others around us.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.440]   So the first thing, the first principle
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.520]   and the first practical that we're given is reveal
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.280]   because what we hide cannot be healed.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.920]   Second principle that we see laid out in scripture
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.600]   comes from Hebrews chapter 12.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.720]   It really comes from all over the place
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.200]   but we'll dive in from Hebrews chapter 12, verse 15.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.120]   It says this, see to it that no one falls short
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.840]   of the grace of God and that no bitter root
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.000]   or the root of bitterness, your translation may have,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.780]   grows up and causes trouble and defiles many.
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:34.240]   That the writer of Hebrews says, see to it
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.560]   that in your lives you do not have a root of bitterness.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.640]   Begin to grow.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.000]   Here's what I love about the analogy, it's brilliant.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.420]   What's a root?
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.820]   It's something that's below the surface that you can't see
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.920]   but it's impacting what's on the surface.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.880]   Some of you are carrying around a root of bitterness
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.960]   and no one can tell and you got a great smile
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.080]   and you have it all together but you are harboring anger
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.360]   and it is impacting what's on the surface.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.220]   And it is gonna impact the future relationships
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.800]   that you have.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.800]   So it's not just evaluating and confessing sins
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.880]   and revealing sins inside of our lives to one another.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.000]   The second principle is really around hurts
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.620]   and that's this, that we have to stop holding onto hurts
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:17.680]   that hold you back.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:24.900]   That there are things in this room that are scars
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:28.220]   that are being carried and you are holding onto hurts
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.860]   from a friend who betrayed you, from a parent who walked out,
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.940]   from someone who abused you, from someone who hurt you,
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.700]   from a coworker who lied about you.
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:40.740]   And that root is beginning to grow and it is not going away
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.280]   and it will have consequences.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.100]   How do I know if I have a root of bitterness growing?
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.500]   Let me give you a couple lists of questions.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.140]   I think these will be on the screen.
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.900]   If it's not already obvious to you,
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:55.180]   if man, I'm angry at this person and until they own it,
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.080]   I'm not forgiving them.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.500]   Here's how else you might know.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.540]   Is there anyone in my life that part of me hopes
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.780]   they fail or suffer?
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.340]   I would be excited about it if things fell apart for them.
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.980]   The root of bitterness has grown.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.860]   Is there anyone whose name, when it's just brought up,
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.440]   it makes me angry or brings bitterness to mind?
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.140]   Is there anyone that I'd avoid in public
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.900]   because of something that happened between us?
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.280]   If I saw them, I would try to go out of my way
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.500]   to avoid them or not let them see me
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.940]   because of what they did.
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:28.180]   Is there anyone that you are waiting to let into your life
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.400]   until they apologize?
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.980]   The root of bitterness is growing.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.260]   Whenever I was engaged to my wife,
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:36.740]   we were going through premarital counseling
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.620]   and the pastor was gonna marry us.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.060]   My wife's parents had been divorced
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.700]   but she had just had some past hurts from her dad.
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.340]   He said, "Have you forgiven your dad?"
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.460]   And she said, "There hasn't been a specific time
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.860]   "that I can remember."
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.060]   And he says, "I can't marry you until you deal with that
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.500]   "because if you can't learn to forgive someone
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.640]   "when they deeply hurt you, you are not ready for marriage.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.980]   "Marriage is one call to forgive someone
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.660]   "who deeply hurts you over and over and over again.
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.500]   "And if you can't do that,
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.620]   "if you're storing up bitterness already,
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.340]   "you're not gonna be prepared to step into marriage."
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.500]   I mean, really candidly, let me tell you the truth.
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.740]   That's what marriage is,
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:20.980]   is the call to forgive someone who deeply hurts you
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.460]   over and over and over again.
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.500]   And I'm not talking about abuse.
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.260]   I'm saying that's just what even healthy marriages are.
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:30.500]   And if you can't and haven't forgiven,
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.060]   if you're carrying around bitterness now,
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.800]   what makes you think you're gonna be the type of person
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.660]   who gets rid of bitterness later?
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.420]   You're gonna store it up and store it up and store it up.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.260]   So I can't marry you.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.780]   If you're dating someone in the room
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.260]   and they haven't walked through the process
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.580]   of forgiving a family member or they're carrying bitterness,
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.120]   you should be concerned
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.140]   because they're gonna carry bitterness against that person,
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.300]   which means they're gonna carry bitterness against you.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.040]   And that root, though it's below the surface,
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.300]   will continue to grow and impact what is on the surface.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.540]   And so you should be concerned if you're dating someone
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.140]   who is not forgiving someone inside of their past.
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:12.740]   There was a, in the 1940s, World War II happened.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.100]   And all over Germany,
[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.180]   there were thousands of bombs that were dropped,
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.140]   thousands of them.
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.180]   So in the midst of World War II, the Allies flew over
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.420]   and they're trying to take down Germany.
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.180]   Thousands and thousands of bombs were dropped.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.180]   Thousands of them did not go off.
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.740]   They're there to this day.
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.260]   All over, in other words, all over Germany,
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.740]   there's cities that there were these bombs that dropped
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:34.580]   and they never went off,
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.540]   maybe 'cause the fuse or something was wrong with them.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.260]   And every now and then, they'll find them.
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.100]   And you know what happens?
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.700]   Oftentimes it happens whenever new construction
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.540]   is coming in and they're like,
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.180]   "We're putting in a McDonald's over here
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.100]   "and sick of the bratwurst, here we go."
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.260]   And they'll begin to dig and they find a bomb.
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.680]   And you know what they do?
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.980]   They gotta evacuate the entire city.
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.620]   And they get everyone out and then they try
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.740]   to defuse the bomb.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.700]   And if they can't defuse it, they have to just set it off
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.440]   'cause they know that, hey, this thing may not go off today
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.140]   or tomorrow, but it's a danger to anyone who's around it.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.860]   So it is with hurts inside of your life.
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:11.100]   If you store anger, if you don't deal with them,
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.900]   it is like a bomb and it's not gonna go off maybe today,
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.920]   maybe tomorrow, but it's not going away.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.020]   And it is a danger to every relationship
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.120]   and person around you.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.860]   And so the question is, man, how do you defuse past hurts?
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:28.320]   The Bible says it's through the process of forgiveness
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.380]   or the second practical is releasing them.
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.260]   That's what forgiveness is, it's releasing.
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.000]   The Bible in Colossians chapter three, verse 13 says this,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.500]   "Bear with each other and forgive one another."
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.820]   If any of you has a grievance or anyone holds a grudge
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.460]   against someone, forgive them.
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.860]   Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.780]   What is forgiveness?
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:54.220]   It is releasing justice to God
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.540]   for the hurt someone else did.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.440]   Hey God, I'm trusting you with that.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.480]   I'm releasing all of that to you, God.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.760]   You're the God who will avenge any wrongs
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.600]   that were done to me.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.760]   Every sin committed against me will be paid for
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.420]   either by them in all of eternity
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.860]   or was paid for on the cross.
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.700]   And so I am releasing that to you, God.
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.540]   I am choosing to forgive this person.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:17.240]   If you wanna experience freedom from the hurts
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.940]   that are gonna hold you back,
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.720]   that are gonna hinder your relationships,
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.380]   it is gonna involve forgiveness.
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.220]   What is forgiveness?
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.740]   It is releasing justice to God
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.420]   for the hurts that were committed against you.
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.220]   I'm not choosing to hold that against them
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.220]   and I'm releasing that and trusting it with you, God.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.420]   Forgiveness is not forgetting.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.720]   In order to even forgive someone,
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.920]   you can't just forget and act like,
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.760]   oh, it never happened.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.140]   It's saying, I see the inexcusable.
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:45.560]   What you did was wrong and I'm not excusing that sin
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.920]   and it was hurtful and it was painful
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.440]   and I'm choosing that I will not hold that against you.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.400]   I'm releasing that to God
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.800]   and I will trust him with the outcome.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.420]   I'll trust him with whatever vengeance
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.960]   or restitution needs to take place.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.240]   That's ultimately in his hands, not mine.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.960]   I'm choosing not, hold that.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.200]   Forgiving is not excusing sin.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.020]   It's not pretending like it didn't hurt
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.720]   or like you're not angry about it.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.400]   Sin should make you angry and sin does hurt.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.960]   Sin makes God angry and it grieves the heart of God.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.120]   Of course, that's a natural response.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.480]   So it's not saying, oh, it never hurt.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.680]   Fine, everything's good.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.880]   It is choosing.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.600]   Despite that, I'm releasing that to you, God.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.600]   I'm trusting.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.600]   I'm not gonna continue to hold onto this
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.680]   and carry it with me.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.520]   And also, it is not optional.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.600]   That as a believer, it is God's call
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.280]   that you are required to forgive
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.800]   as he has forgiven the inexcusable in your life.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.660]   And finally, it's not conditional.
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.660]   I think the most common thing that I'll hear is,
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.100]   hey, man, if they will own their part,
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.400]   if they would come and apologize,
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.560]   they don't even think they did anything wrong.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.880]   They're all defensive and they're like,
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.560]   man, if he comes and begs for my forgiveness,
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.400]   then I'll give it to him.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.280]   But until then, I'm not gonna just empower
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.480]   and entitle him there.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.120]   The Bible says forgiveness is not conditional.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.920]   It's not a, hey, once they do this,
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.160]   then I will forgive them.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.680]   It is a call to release to God.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.000]   Hey, I'm trusting you with those things.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.700]   I'm not gonna hold them against them,
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.200]   just like you, God, didn't hold my sin against me.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:21.680]   And tragically, as long as you hold onto those things,
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.580]   and if you're waiting for someone to come apologize
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.680]   or own their part or make it up to you,
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.960]   you're holding onto a hurt
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.600]   that is only gonna hold you back.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.280]   I was talking with Josh who leads out in Fort Worth,
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.480]   and we were talking this past week,
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.920]   and he grew up out in the country,
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.720]   and he was telling about raccoons that would come
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.760]   and try to kill chickens.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.400]   And so the way that they would trap these raccoons
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.160]   is they would drill a hole into the side of a tree or a log
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.200]   and kind of make a trap,
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.360]   and they would put a shiny object in the hole.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.920]   And then you put these screws around the hole
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.140]   so they could reach their hand in
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.240]   to grab the shiny object,
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.200]   but if they made a fist, they couldn't get out.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.040]   And though at any point,
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.880]   they could just release the shiny object and go,
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.920]   it never comes into their mind,
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.160]   'cause they're like, no, I have to hold onto this thing.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.520]   And they don't realize that their freedom
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:12.280]   is within their hands if they'll just let it go.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.700]   In the same way, there is a freedom
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.420]   that God wants you to experience,
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.360]   but as long as you hold onto hurts
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.320]   or hold onto requiring they come do something,
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.260]   they make it up, they own their part,
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.160]   they need to apologize,
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.480]   you are holding onto the shiny object,
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.700]   and you are holding yourself back
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.600]   from experiencing the freedom God wants you to experience.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:37.520]   From no longer being owned by a bitterness that's there,
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.480]   and he's inviting you, will you release that?
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.540]   Will you trust that to me?
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.100]   Every sin will be paid for.
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.840]   It has been paid for on the cross,
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.600]   or it will be paid for in all of eternity by them.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.680]   Will you release that?
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.720]   And in doing so, you'll experience freedom.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.380]   Part of the reason maybe some of us in this room
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.820]   struggle with forgiveness is we think about,
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.020]   man, the hardest thing is to forgive myself.
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.200]   I can't forgive myself for what I did.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.040]   And the bad news is you can't forgive yourself.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.440]   But you can accept God's forgiveness.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.480]   That's what the Bible teaches.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.320]   The Bible doesn't teach that, hey,
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.560]   you just need to forgive yourself.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.200]   The Bible teaches that you need to accept
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.640]   God's forgiveness over your life.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.640]   That's what it means to be a Christian.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.660]   In other words, to be a Christian,
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.500]   in case this is new,
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.840]   maybe you're back in church for the first time,
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.440]   a Christian is someone who says,
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.820]   I am not trusting in my behavior,
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.220]   how good of a person I am, the things that I've done,
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.740]   how many Bible verses that I know,
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.180]   how many times I go to church.
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.580]   That won't get me into heaven,
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.540]   and it won't allow me to have a relationship with God.
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.260]   A Christian says, despite everything good I do
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.020]   or everything bad that I've done,
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.620]   the only way that I can have a relationship with God
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.940]   and experience eternal life in heaven
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:49.020]   is by trusting in Jesus and what he did on the cross,
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.500]   paying for my sin, dying in my place, and rising again.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.420]   He died the death I deserve
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.120]   so that I could live the life
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.040]   that I cannot live without him.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.480]   That is what it means to be a Christian,
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.240]   is essentially, God, I'm choosing to accept him.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.360]   I'm accepting your forgiveness,
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.540]   not 'cause I earned it, not 'cause I deserve it,
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.000]   but because you offered it to me.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.060]   When you gave me your life,
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.540]   that's the only way I can have eternal life.
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.340]   That's what it means to be a Christian.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.040]   And the truth of the matter is,
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.880]   if you're saying, man,
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.120]   I just can't get over forgiving myself,
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.840]   you're holding a higher standard than God is.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.020]   And you're also belittling the work that he did
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.660]   through Jesus on the cross.
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.900]   And the option of the action you need to take
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.160]   is not choosing to forgive yourself,
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.240]   it's choosing to accept God's forgiveness
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.540]   despite the fact that you do not deserve it.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.560]   So the second R that comes from here is release.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.640]   Release, the practical of, hey man,
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.480]   stop holding onto hurts that are gonna hold you back.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.380]   You've got to release them through forgiving.
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.000]   You've got to make the decision, I choose to forgive you.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.480]   I remember one of the most powerful things
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.520]   that really I think marked my 20s
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.060]   was a moment where I had to do this myself.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.680]   I had to sit down and I had to make the decision
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.980]   that I had to forgive my dad.
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.140]   I was raised by a single mom,
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.460]   and I've shared about that,
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.380]   and my dad was really absent, he wasn't around.
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:11.180]   And the times that he was around, it's just not great.
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:14.080]   And we'd see him every other week on a Monday night.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.940]   And I realized there were some things in my heart
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.080]   that I was just holding onto bitterness,
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.740]   and I had to go, and I had to,
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.420]   for me, I had to go write it down,
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.100]   and I had to choose and make the decision to forgive.
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.860]   And say, man, you took from me a dad
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.380]   who was present in my life,
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:32.140]   and I'm choosing to forgive you.
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.080]   You took from me every other Monday night
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.900]   where I had to drive across town to that tiny apartment,
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.780]   and I'm choosing to forgive.
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.640]   You took from me a father who would attend sporting events,
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.020]   a father who was present,
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.780]   who actually knew anything about his son.
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:49.860]   You took that from me.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.860]   I didn't get to have that because of you.
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:56.100]   And I'm choosing to forgive you and release it.
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.580]   Ultimately, it's a sin against God,
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.900]   but I'm not gonna carry that anymore.
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:07.420]   And every time that in my life I find a new hurt
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.740]   or a new thing that I'm like, man, I feel like I'm bitter,
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.940]   I find a new balm.
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.580]   I gotta go in and I have to diffuse it
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.980]   through forgiveness and make the decision.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.640]   I'm not holding that against them.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.080]   I'm releasing that, God.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.440]   I'm trusting that with you.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.880]   The third principle, really, that we see
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.560]   is found in Mark chapter five
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.960]   and the story of a man who was demon-possessed.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.240]   It was a guy that Jesus shows up,
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.160]   and I'll kind of set up the scene
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.040]   and we'll get the third principle and then practical.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.800]   Where Jesus shows up, he's kind of going around,
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.360]   he's on the scene, he's doing miracles,
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.160]   and he goes and he finds this guy
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.680]   who we're told is demon-possessed.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.700]   He's just kind of crazy.
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.880]   He lives all by himself.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.440]   It says he lives in a graveyard,
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.480]   and he's cutting himself and he's not wearing clothes,
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.320]   and he's just like Crazy Carl.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.020]   And everyone knew Crazy Carl.
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.240]   You don't go near that graveyard
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.040]   'cause Crazy Carl's over there.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.180]   And Jesus shows up, he goes right up to the man,
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.200]   and he heals him.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.800]   And this man, it says, is now clothed in his right mind,
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.240]   sitting at Jesus' feet, and he's totally changed,
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.520]   and all of a sudden the town is coming up,
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.080]   and they're like, what happened to Crazy Carl?
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.680]   And that's not in the Bible or his name.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.000]   But he was crazy, and Jesus healed him.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.800]   And it says that Jesus then went to go on
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.440]   and to go to another town, and here's what happened.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.080]   As Jesus was getting into the boat,
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.920]   the man who had been possessed with demons
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:32.600]   begged Jesus, him, that he might be with him,
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.200]   or that he might come with him.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.320]   But Jesus did not permit him, but he said to him,
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.680]   go home to your friends and tell them
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.020]   how much the Lord has done for you,
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.140]   how he has had mercy on you.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.200]   And he went away and he began to proclaim
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.360]   in the Decapolis, which is just the city,
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.920]   how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.840]   Jesus said, don't come with me.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.160]   How crazy is that?
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.360]   This dude is like, hey, I wanna be the 13th disciple.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.200]   Can I come?
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.680]   And Jesus says, no, I want you to stay here,
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.120]   and I want you to go and tell people
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.200]   everything that I've done in your life.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.360]   Go home and tell your friends
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.640]   about the power of God at work in your life.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.600]   The third idea, really, that I hope,
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.480]   as clearly as I can, and I don't know if I do,
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.440]   justice to this.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.340]   The third principle is that there is no past in here
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:23.420]   that cannot be a platform for God's power
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.820]   if you will let him.
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.060]   I don't know what your story is,
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.020]   I don't know what you've done,
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.060]   I don't know where you are right now,
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.100]   I don't know what you did today,
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.680]   but I do know this, that if you will allow God
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.780]   to come into your life and bring healing there,
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:38.340]   there's no person who has committed sins and offenses
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.980]   and done such things that God can't be incredible
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.980]   or God can't write an incredible story through your life
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.640]   and he wants to write an incredible story
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.600]   through your life that you cannot be a platform
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.440]   for the power of God.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.680]   What do I mean by platform?
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.960]   I mean someone who surrenders and God says,
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.560]   man, look, all these different things that I've done.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.200]   I'm a serial adulterer, I slept with a married woman.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:03.440]   I've been dealing drugs, I've been,
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.560]   I don't know what your story is.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.320]   Maybe it's an eating disorder that you've carried,
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.160]   whatever those different,
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.200]   maybe it was sexual abuse that was done to you,
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.280]   maybe you're in a homosexual relationship right now.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.180]   None of those things makes you anything less
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.520]   than the perfect candidate for someone that God
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.380]   will write an incredible story if you allow him to.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.840]   And that story will be a platform.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.760]   What do I mean by platform?
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.280]   A platform is something that you stand on
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.040]   and in doing so, it displays to others.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.520]   It allows others to more effectively see.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.480]   In other words, this is a platform.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.880]   When I step down here on the ground,
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.280]   you cannot as effectively see.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.040]   If you're listening or looking on the camera,
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.260]   you can no longer effectively see me as well,
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.720]   but if you will allow God to come into your life,
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.560]   and take your story, and take whatever ashes you have,
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.720]   he will turn them into beauty.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.600]   Take a garment of heaviness
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.240]   and make it a garment of praise, he says.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.160]   And he will put you, and your story will not become
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.920]   something in your past that you're embarrassed and ashamed,
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.280]   and I don't wanna ever talk about it,
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.720]   but it will be something that is a display
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.840]   where others can see and they go, oh my gosh,
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.940]   God has gotta be behind that,
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:07.240]   'cause that doesn't make any sense apart from him.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.960]   There's so many different stories that have marked
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.200]   the lives inside of this room.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.640]   I mean, that's what the porch is,
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.320]   is a bunch of broken people coming together,
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.460]   trying to walk with Jesus as best we can,
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.680]   and openly be honest about the times where we're not.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:23.200]   And God, in the midst of doing so,
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.640]   writes these incredible stories where you can't help
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.100]   but look at them and go, there's gotta be a God.
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.680]   That doesn't make any sense apart from him.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.680]   Let me give you a few examples.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.240]   There's a girl that was in Florida
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.680]   a couple of years ago, a few years ago.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.600]   She was working at a club, she was doing bottle service,
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.160]   she was living for the weekend,
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.560]   and living for the party life.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:46.400]   All of a sudden, a friend kinda introduced her to the porch,
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.160]   she started listening, she started getting plugged
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.280]   into a local church there, her life began to change.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.920]   She moved here to serve here.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.940]   And her life radically transformed from this girl
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.440]   who was living the party life and doing bottle service
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:02.080]   to now running and really behind everything
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.280]   that you see done in terms of social media here.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.240]   That she doesn't spend her life
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.200]   trying to get other people drunk,
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.440]   she spends her life trying to let people know about Jesus.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.200]   There's another guy who's moved here from Texas Tech,
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.400]   was chasing after the corporate ladder of corporate America
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.920]   and trying to make a million dollars by the time he's 30,
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.320]   living for the weekend, he was still living the frat life.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.100]   God comes into his world, turns it upside down,
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.640]   and he's responsible for discipling more of the volunteers
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.520]   and people here than anyone else in the last 10 years.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.720]   But God, story after story,
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.160]   how do you explain that apart from Jesus?
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.920]   And what their life is now, is their past,
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.240]   is not something that's like a problem
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.760]   or defines them or any of that.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.960]   It is a display of the power of God to change people.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.820]   Whatever your story is, that is what God wants it to be.
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.560]   He wants you to tell people how much he's done for you.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.800]   And if you're unwilling to do that,
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.880]   or if you're not at a place where you're experiencing
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.920]   how much he's done for you,
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.480]   that's the invitation to you tonight.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.960]   We allow him to take your past, take your problems,
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.600]   and make them a platform for him.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.520]   And the question is, not if he's willing,
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.860]   it's if you're willing.
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:12.120]   The third idea is, just the R behind this,
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.560]   is recognize that your past can be a platform
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.880]   for God's power, a display to the world around us.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:26.800]   And the tragedy is, it's not just that you're risking
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:32.140]   becoming, if you're unwilling to move towards healing,
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:34.760]   you're not just risking becoming who you don't wanna be.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.320]   You are forfeiting becoming the man God wants you to be
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.160]   and that you wanna be.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.360]   You are operating at less than 100%.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.200]   What do I mean by that?
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.400]   Like, let me use this example, and do this,
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.440]   and then tell a story, and then we'll close.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.640]   This is a vacuum, handheld vacuum.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.920]   And we use it all the time at my house.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.760]   It's great.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.600]   (audience cheering)
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:53.440]   Black and Decker.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.560]   And it's not the best vacuum of all time,
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.520]   but it gets the job done.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.080]   Here's where it doesn't get the job done.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:58.920]   We'll be vacuuming along.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.960]   This is not a very big opening.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.040]   So all of a sudden, kids and little kids
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.960]   and kids and different things get picked up.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.200]   Something gets lodged in there.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.120]   You know what happens when something gets lodged in here?
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.880]   All of a sudden, the effectiveness of the vacuum
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.880]   goes from 100%, 'cause it had entire opening up,
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.880]   to less than 100%.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.740]   And so it's no longer oping as effective
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.460]   as it would have been.
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.920]   Do you know what else is interesting that happens
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.080]   when something gets lodged in here?
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.300]   It makes it more susceptible to other things
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.800]   getting lodged in there.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.940]   Like, all of a sudden, it's like, boom,
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.020]   it's kinda clogged up, and more things get stopped in there
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:31.680]   that wouldn't have even gotten stopped
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.440]   had there not been something lodged in there already.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.320]   This is how your soul works.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.520]   You'll be going along through life,
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.360]   and all of a sudden, something will get lodged.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:43.000]   Maybe you were exposed to pornography.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.100]   A friend betrayed you.
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.080]   A girlfriend cheated on you.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.800]   All of a sudden, something gets lodged in there,
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.700]   and if you're not diligent to deal with it,
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.680]   it's not going away, and you will be walking with a limp.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.320]   You're not operating at 100%,
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.100]   and you will have a more likelihood
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:58.920]   of other things getting lodged in your soul.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.920]   What do I mean by that?
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.440]   If you don't deal with the different hurts
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.520]   that pop up in your life, like, let's take pornography.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.480]   If it gets lodged inside of there,
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:11.240]   you're gonna be more likely to have other secret addictions
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.080]   and other things begin to spread.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.600]   You're gonna be more likely, not just that,
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.460]   for also things just coming out.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:17.520]   Like, if you're looking at porn in the room,
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.040]   it's coming out of the woodworks for you.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.000]   Every girl that you look at,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.280]   you struggle to not try to undress her with your eyes
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.920]   or wonder what underwear she has on,
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.000]   because it got lodged,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.080]   and other things are starting to stick.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.720]   Maybe there's a hurt from your past,
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.600]   and if you don't deal with it and get rid,
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.800]   remove that thing,
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:37.120]   that offense that took place,
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.000]   you will be more easily offended all the time.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.280]   And so that one big hurt of that friend who betrayed you,
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.560]   all of a sudden, you're so easily offended
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.920]   that if somebody doesn't follow you on Instagram,
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.960]   you're like, oh my gosh, what is wrong with her?
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.540]   I'm unfollowing her, that's what I'm doing,
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.720]   because something got lodged, you didn't deal with it,
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.320]   and now little things are beginning to stick.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.720]   That's who you are becoming.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.280]   And the only way for you to experience healing,
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.400]   whether it's a hurt or a sin hangup,
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:05.600]   is for you to reveal and bring others in,
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.600]   for you to release the hurts from your life
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.360]   and allow God to be the one
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.840]   who administers justice for those things,
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.460]   and for you to recognize whatever your story is,
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.940]   God wants to use it if you will let him.
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:21.400]   Or you can just let it get lodged.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.280]   No one can tell.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.840]   If something gets stuck in there,
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.400]   unless you look inside, it'll turn it on,
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.240]   it's really hard to tell.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.660]   So you can continue to coast, no one will know,
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.880]   you come here every Tuesday, try to get better,
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.180]   and you will suffer in secrecy,
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.120]   and that God is there, he's crazy about you,
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:41.960]   and he's inviting you,
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.480]   will you come and experience healing?
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.040]   Conclusion, God is calling you,
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.160]   that there are areas in all of our lives
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.440]   that we have to constantly reveal to others.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.000]   There are hurts that we have to constantly release
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.760]   through forgiveness and recognize.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.600]   There's no story that God can't use
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.760]   and doesn't want to use if we will let him.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.160]   Probably the most powerful thing,
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.900]   and I'm gonna close here, so I'll land the plane,
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.280]   if I haven't been with you, just come back right here,
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.520]   stop counting these little wood things
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.440]   or any of the stuff on the roof, right here,
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.320]   I'm gonna close.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.080]   Here's the most powerful thing in this show
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.320]   that I've been watching.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.440]   There's one question, it's actually really helpful.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.480]   Whenever you get stuck and you're like,
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.280]   oh man, should I get rid of this, should I not?
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.760]   It's just a single question, it is,
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.960]   hey, is this something that I envision
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.840]   taking into my future with me,
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.520]   that it's a part of my future life,
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.320]   or it's something I should leave in the past?
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.160]   Why is that helpful?
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.840]   'Cause it's like, oh man, look at this Pearl Snap shirt,
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.200]   I don't think that I am,
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.860]   I don't think I should bring this into the future.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.120]   This is no longer in, no offense to Pearl Snaps,
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.800]   they're great, so don't get lost there.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.140]   But point being, hey, these binoculars,
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:46.880]   I don't envision my future being like around town
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.880]   as I think about it.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.840]   The God who's there is inviting you
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:56.160]   as it relates to hurts in your life,
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.360]   as it relates to sin habits in your present.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:02.680]   Are you willing to allow Him to begin
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.400]   to breathe healing into those things?
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.900]   'Cause the choice is yours, so let me ask it another way.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.080]   You need to leave here tonight,
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.640]   the question before all of us,
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.960]   is there things that you're holding onto?
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.320]   I don't know what they are, I don't know what they are
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.520]   for you, but the question you need to be asking,
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.720]   is this something I envision in my future
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.960]   or something that I need to let go of from my past?
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.920]   Let me say it another way, let's say you're 22,
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.600]   you're 22 years old in the room,
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.400]   and you have an eating disorder.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.120]   I wanna ask you a question.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.600]   Is that something that you wanna bring into your future?
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.480]   Let's roll forward the clock, 10 years from now,
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.780]   you're 32, coworkers come in, it's your 32-year-old birthday
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:39.200]   to bring a 32 on the cake, to set it down in front of you.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.880]   Do you envision having an eating disorder
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.840]   on your 32nd birthday?
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.420]   Is that something you wanna bring in there?
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:48.200]   Or is it something you wanna let go of from your past?
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.320]   You go, of course I'm not gonna bring it in there.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:54.200]   Do you know when you will stop having an eating disorder?
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.200]   When you'll allow others in, when you begin to reveal
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.080]   and experience the cure in your life.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.440]   Let's play the game another way.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.560]   You're 25 and you're addicted to pornography.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.920]   Let's go five years.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.760]   Like, what do you think about?
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.960]   You're five years, five years down the road,
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.240]   30th birthday, they bring in 30, balloon,
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.320]   a three and a zero, and it's like, happy birthday.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.220]   The question before you is, is that something
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.560]   you wanna carry into your future?
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.960]   When you envision 30-year-old me,
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.680]   is that something you want to mark your life?
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.320]   Or is that something you need to let go of in the past?
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.320]   'Cause here's the lie.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.720]   It's not going away any other way.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.240]   Not today, not tomorrow, not when you turn 30,
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.480]   not when you get married.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:38.760]   Maybe you were abused and it was evil and it was wrong
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:43.760]   and you're not alone and God will have vengeance.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.560]   First Thessalonians chapter four says,
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:48.360]   "He's the avenger of such actions."
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:53.200]   And you're carrying hurt and you don't trust people anymore.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.720]   And I just wanna ask you, and you're 24,
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.200]   let's roll forward the clock, you're 40, 16 years.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.520]   Family gets together,
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.520]   they got an over the hill party for you.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:08.480]   Is that something you envision carrying into your 40s?
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.400]   Are you ready to release it?
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.280]   Because it's not gonna magically happen at some point.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.640]   It will happen when you choose,
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.560]   God, I'm trusting you with that.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.800]   I'm letting this go.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.160]   I don't wanna carry this anymore.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.760]   I don't want this to mark my life.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.620]   And the invitation that God of the universe is giving to you
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.880]   is that you can trust me with that.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.080]   And if you allow me to come in
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.360]   through other people around you
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.280]   and experience what my word wants for you,
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:35.040]   which is healing, you will have it.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.960]   Not perfectly and not in a moment,
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.360]   but you will experience the only healing
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.000]   this world has or offers.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.560]   Or you can hold it.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.040]   But it's not going away.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.400]   And the question you need to wrestle the ground,
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.720]   is this something I envision my future with?
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.600]   'Cause it's not going away
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.560]   unless you deal with it in the present.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.200]   Let me pray.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.040]   Father, I pray for
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:02.920]   every person in this room
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.680]   who's hiding
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:10.080]   that you would in your mercy
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.840]   expose
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.720]   their heart to the things that they've never told anyone.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:20.560]   Maybe the parts of their heart
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.280]   they're not even aware of themselves.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:26.760]   Maybe things that they have never told anyone.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:30.360]   I pray that you would heal.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:35.200]   I pray for anyone who's ever experienced
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.400]   abuse from another person
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.120]   that they would tonight experience
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.200]   the parts and you would allow them
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.520]   to continue to experience healing.
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.200]   And that story, which is tragic and evil,
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.400]   and it wasn't their fault,
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.960]   would become a platform
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.160]   that shows your power.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:59.200]   I pray for the future
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:04.240]   of the current 23 and 24 and 25 and whatever age
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.160]   that you would help us to be men and women
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.640]   who diligently clean out the parts of our lives
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.640]   that don't align with you.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.040]   And that the 30th birthday or the 40th birthday,
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.160]   whatever the future holds for us,
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.000]   we wouldn't be holding onto things
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.720]   that are hurting our soul,
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.720]   holding us back
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:27.600]   and hindering us from being a platform for you.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.240]   We worship you now in song, amen.
