[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:24.680]   All right, well, let's go.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.920]   Welcome everybody in the room, everybody
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.560]   at the 15 Ports Live locations.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.880]   We've got a special treat and special guest for tonight
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.520]   that should Jesus tarry, and in a couple hundred years,
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.720]   they're going to write the history of Jesus
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.480]   doesn't come back.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.940]   At some point in time, they're going
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.600]   to write the history books of the church in North America.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.480]   And inside of it, I am confident they're
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.560]   going to include something about passion and passion
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.160]   conferences and the impact and the ripple and the effect
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.440]   that that ministry has had.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.920]   My life personally was impacted.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.640]   I remember sitting as a college student
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.380]   and hearing somebody get up on a stage
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.240]   and passionately believe in my generation.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.720]   And that ripple effect impacted me, still impacts me today.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.340]   And the number of friends and ministry
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.760]   that I have that share that same story is astounding.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.380]   What does that have to do with tonight?
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.220]   Well, tonight, we're continuing this series,
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.560]   and Louis Giglio is here to teach
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.440]   as we continue this series.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.760]   And if you don't, for whatever reason, know Louis,
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.960]   you are about to be blessed.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.880]   He's one of the most incredible teachers of God's word
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.120]   alive right now.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.080]   We are so privileged to have him here.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.260]   So will you give a huge welcome and hand together
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.320]   for Louis Giglio?
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.520]   Thank you.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.400]   Easy.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.400]   Well, thanks, David.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.280]   And thanks for having me at the porch.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.840]   My first time ever at the porch.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.720]   Where have I been?
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.520]   What in the world have I been doing?
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.720]   And so grateful to be here.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.920]   So much respect for this house, for the Shanes
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.800]   who paved the way here, JP, other people
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.840]   who plowed this ground, David doing such an amazing job.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.680]   Steering the whole team here is incredible.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.800]   So thanks for having me tonight.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.240]   This is a big deal for us because we're
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.880]   offering a sacrifice of praise tonight
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.240]   because we're in the World Series right now.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.360]   Like, right now.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.920]   So don't start that Astro stuff because we're
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.120]   about to get in the spirit and stay in the spirit.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.480]   And I don't want anything to disrupt the spirit.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.280]   My wife's from Houston.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.080]   I've lived in Houston on and off,
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.720]   lived in Texas for a long time.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.000]   I was at the ballpark at Arlington and then
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.280]   the stadium before that.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.960]   No one even remembers that.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.880]   It was like a minor league baseball stadium
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.880]   where the Rangers played.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.040]   Anybody remember?
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.160]   A few people here.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.400]   So I was at those games.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.000]   I went to grad school in Fort Worth, have a lot of history.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.720]   But I'm a Braves fan through and through,
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.800]   born in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   Go Braves.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.560]   Let's go Braves.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.920]   That's it.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.680]   Up two zips.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.000]   So he's going to keep me posted through the talk.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.120]   The little hand signals down here
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.720]   let me know if I need to preach harder or pray harder.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.760]   I'm so happy to be here in this series.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.800]   You have no idea.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.920]   As I'm stepping into the series you're doing right now,
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.400]   we're all freaking out.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.800]   But we don't need to be.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.280]   I am the perfect person for this series.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.880]   You're like, oh, that's a big boast.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.600]   No, I'm going to tell you a story later
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.120]   that if you don't know my story, you're
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.760]   going to be amazed that I'm here tonight.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.240]   Because it is a miracle that I am in this place.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.160]   I have been so far down in a hole of depression and darkness
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.320]   in my life that I never thought I would so much as
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:01.120]   go to a restaurant again, much less be mostly in my right mind
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.840]   depending on who you ask, and filled with the Spirit,
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.040]   the light of Jesus in my eyes, doing the very thing God's
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.920]   called me to do, and standing in the grace of God.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.800]   If you told me that 12 years ago,
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.560]   I would have just said, thank you.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.240]   I'm sure you believe that.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.800]   And somewhere deep down, I probably believe that.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.120]   But I could imagine me walking on water
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.440]   or riding a bicycle to Mars more than I
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.800]   could have imagined me being in this place right now.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.680]   So when I'm coming into this series tonight,
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.000]   I take mental health seriously.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.880]   I know personally that depression is real.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.240]   Anxiety is a thing.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.040]   Fear has got a grip in some way on all of our lives tonight.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.160]   But what I want to say on top of that is having--
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.440]   and I'll come back and explain a little bit more
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.080]   about that pit later in the message.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.480]   But what I want to say is I can say,
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.880]   I think, even though some people hit back,
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.200]   even when I try to say this, that anxiety is real
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.400]   and depression is real, fear is real, panic is real.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.400]   But they are not bigger than Jesus.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.400]   Jesus is greater than all of them.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.120]   And so they're not going to get the throne tonight.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.080]   So this isn't going to be psychobabble.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.000]   It's not going to be Louie's opinion.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.960]   It's not going to be us all having a latte
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.840]   and comforting each other and just accepting the fact
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.000]   that anxiety is a part of all of our lives.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.440]   So let's just learn how to deal with it.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.920]   I was in a situation about seven years ago
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.040]   going through a hard time in leading.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.400]   And leading is hard, by the way.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.200]   Just heads up.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.320]   If you're leading something, you already know that.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.640]   But leading is hard.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.680]   And Shelly and I had just come through a very challenging
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.400]   season.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.520]   Some things have been said.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.720]   Some things have been done.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.640]   Some friendships had been strained.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.960]   And we were sort of surviving through several months
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.160]   of this deal.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.280]   And I was on the way home from work one day, David,
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.440]   and my phone rang.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.360]   And it was a friend.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.120]   And they were calling me with a "you're not
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.080]   going to believe this" call that we all
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.240]   want to get when things have gone sideways.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.920]   Do you know what the "you're not going to believe this" call is?
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.000]   Does anybody know what I'm talking about?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.600]   No?
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.000]   It's the call that goes like this.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.360]   Is everybody OK, by the way?
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.600]   That depression turn might have slowed everybody down.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.880]   We're going to come back up here any minute now.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.560]   You're looking at me like, I don't know.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.680]   Really?
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.440]   Seriously?
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.280]   That happened to you?
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.400]   Yes, it did.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.400]   But so the call was, you're not going
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.120]   to believe what I just heard.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.160]   And here we are several months down the road,
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.280]   and something happened that vindicated my cause.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.040]   Do you know that call now?
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.160]   If you just write it out sometimes,
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.880]   a little light will shine, and then you'll go see there.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.520]   And I was so happy.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.600]   I know you're like, what?
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.400]   You're a mess, man.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.040]   You were in this hole, and now you want vindication?
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.080]   Yes, I'm just letting you know about my humanity tonight, OK?
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.000]   I was so excited that when I got home,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.800]   I texted a friend of mine who had walked shoulder
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.760]   to shoulder through this whole storm with me.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.840]   And I texted him the I want to commiserate text.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.960]   It goes like this.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.560]   You are not going to believe what I just heard.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.640]   So-and-so just called me and told me that XYZ just happened.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.080]   I knew it was going to happen.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.000]   I knew if we waited long enough, we would see the true motive.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.480]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.080]   It was a lengthy text.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.360]   And in my demographic, my age bracket,
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.080]   I'm talking about a 30-minute piece of work this text was.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.080]   And I'm standing in my driveway, and I hit Send.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.840]   And it's the kind of text where you don't send the text
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.880]   and then go on about whatever else you were doing.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.120]   You just stare at the phone until you get a text back.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.560]   And I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.560]   And I want a text back that is--
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.640]   it's proportional to the text I sent.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.680]   And all of a sudden, my phone buzzes.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.760]   And I look down, and there's a little blurb on my phone.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.680]   And I'm like, this is the kind of text
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.760]   that the next text says, hey, I'm sorry.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.920]   I hit Send too soon.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.960]   Here's the rest of the text.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.800]   So I didn't even look at the little blurb.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.160]   I'm just waiting for the rest of the text.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.400]   Nothing, nothing.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.000]   Minute goes by.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.040]   Five minutes go by.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.160]   I'm like, this is it.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.720]   I might as well now look at the little blurb.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.360]   And I did.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.600]   And when I looked down, there were nine words on my phone.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.760]   And the nine words from a friend of mine
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.160]   that I was looking for commiseration
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.600]   and a little celebration of the moment, the vindication moment,
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.080]   the nine words on my phone said, don't give the enemy
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.400]   a seat at your table.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.640]   And those words, they literally stopped me in my tracks.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.600]   I was frozen at the top of my driveway, staring at my phone
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.040]   and realizing, what in the world am I doing?
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.520]   For the last five months, six months of my life,
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.880]   I have been in this place of consternation and frustration
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.560]   and control and laying awake at night,
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.400]   having all these conversations, managing all the outcomes
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.320]   of everything, making sure everything worked out
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.920]   so that people knew what my motives were
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.040]   and where I was in the equation.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.960]   And the whole time, I realized I have
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.840]   been having a conversation with a killer the whole time.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.920]   The one that Jesus said, the thief comes
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.200]   to steal and kill and destroy.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.120]   I have been letting him sit at my table,
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.280]   and I've been dialoguing with him
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.400]   and letting him influence my thinking and my feelings
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.520]   about the whole situation.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.880]   And right then and there, I said,
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.640]   I am taking my table back, meaning
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.040]   I'm taking my thought life back on this matter.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.880]   I am not going to let the enemy just pull up a chair to the table
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.840]   that my shepherd has prepared before me
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.200]   in the presence of my enemies.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.720]   I have let Satan just slide in the side door.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.400]   And all of a sudden, I'm not only listening to him,
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.480]   I'm talking back to him.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.280]   And now I'm repeating what he's telling me to other people.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.520]   You're like, what do you mean?
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.520]   How would that look?
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.080]   It would look something like this.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.080]   Psalm 23.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.600]   Do you know the Psalm 23?
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.560]   Everybody's heard of it, right?
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.280]   Yes?
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.400]   Maybe the most famous passage of scripture
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.400]   to people in the church and outside the church.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.320]   You start, the Lord is my shepherd.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.320]   I shall not want.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:24.960]   People know.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.720]   OK, I heard that.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.480]   It was in a movie.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:26.840]   I saw it.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.720]   There was a funeral scene.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.160]   And someone read that Psalm.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.120]   Or there was a wedding.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.280]   And someone said that phrase.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.360]   But this is one of the most gritty, powerful promises
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.040]   that God is making to you right now in your life
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.640]   and in this series.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.800]   And if you're struggling with anxiety, with depression,
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.560]   with panic, with fear, with worry,
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.560]   if you are feeling isolated and you
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.760]   feel like you're down in some dark hole
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.560]   and you're not really sure if you're
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.760]   going to be able to function normally again,
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.280]   Psalm 23 is God's promise to you tonight.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.240]   This is not your grandmother's Psalm.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.120]   I know maybe when we go back to this place,
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.760]   it reminds us, the Lord is my shepherd.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.520]   I shall not want.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.400]   He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.640]   He restores my soul.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.320]   I mean, yes, it feels like cross stitch on the dining room
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.960]   wall at your grandmother's house, or a bookmark maybe,
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.440]   with a little shepherd's crook on it
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.280]   that somebody gave you when you were a kid.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.760]   But it isn't that.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.080]   This is street cred.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.200]   This is legit.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.760]   This is God Almighty saying to you, if you let me,
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.920]   I will lead you.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.000]   You don't have to let me.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.440]   But if you let me, I'll lead you.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.480]   You can lead yourself.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.840]   But if you let me, I'll lead you.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.440]   You can let somebody else lead you,
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.040]   or let the culture lead you, or let the loudest voice
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.240]   on your social media lead you, or you
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.920]   can let the news lead you, or whatever's
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.120]   happening around you lead you.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.760]   Or you can lead yourself.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.560]   But if you'll let me lead you, I'll lead you,
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.600]   starting right now.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.760]   And here are the results.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.720]   I will make you lie down in green pasture,
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.560]   because honestly, this sounds terrible,
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.600]   but we're not smart enough to lie down
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.760]   in green pasture on our own.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.960]   So he's going to cause us to find green pasture,
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.840]   and he's going to slow us down, and he's
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.920]   going to make us lie down.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.400]   He says, not only that, I'm going
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.720]   to lead you beside still water, and I
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.160]   want to restore your soul.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.240]   I'll guide you.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.560]   Who doesn't want guidance and paths of righteousness
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.680]   for his namesake?
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.840]   And yea, verily, King James, even if I walk,
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.040]   or even though I walk through the valley of the shadow
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.120]   of death, I will--
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.840]   here comes our word for tonight--
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:42.280]   fear no evil, for you are with me.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:47.920]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:53.560]   You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:13:00.360]   You anoint my head with oil, and my cup overflows.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.680]   Surely goodness and love--
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.960]   that's who's got my back.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.320]   That's who's over my shoulder.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.960]   They will follow me all the days of my life,
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.400]   and at the end of this journey, I'm
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.760]   going to dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:22.800]   Jesus is offering you tonight to lead you like that.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.960]   And if you'll say yes to him, things will begin to change.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.600]   And I believe the fear factor will
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.320]   begin to lower in your life.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:38.720]   Fear doesn't go away when we self-manage internally.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.920]   Fear begins to drift out of our lives
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.360]   when we come to a revelation of who
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.600]   it is who is with us in the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.920]   So we don't need so much more like working on the inside
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.000]   as we do an awareness of the God who is with us as we're
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.280]   walking through this life.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.360]   I don't know about you, but when I was growing up,
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.560]   is everybody OK so far?
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.320]   Are we still doing good in the game?
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.400]   Everything's good?
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.840]   All right, you're not giving me any signals, nothing?
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.160]   Keep looking over there, and you're not giving me anything.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.520]   When I was a kid, we lived in an apartment complex
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.800]   that had a swimming pool in the middle of it.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.840]   And on a Saturday, we'd be at the pool in the summertime.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.920]   And my dad was a big golfer, so he
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.200]   would come in from golf around 2 o'clock every Saturday
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:24.920]   afternoon.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.380]   And he would drift up to the pool,
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.120]   because we'd be up there, my sister and I,
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.880]   and all the friends in our neighborhood.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.640]   And when I was little, like this big,
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.840]   I could not wait for my dad to get home from golf.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.040]   Because when he came to the pool, everything changed.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.040]   And moms in the world, and future moms in the world,
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:42.680]   you're amazing.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.480]   You're Superman, Superwoman.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.160]   You do it all.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.360]   But I mean, when dad shows up, it's like, oh my gosh,
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:47.920]   dad's here.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.320]   Dad, watch me!
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.680]   Dad, watch me!
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.640]   I want to do my jump.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.000]   I want to do my whatever.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.760]   And my dad started us out when we were little,
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.480]   and he put us on the edge of the pool.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.960]   Did anybody's dad ever do this?
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.440]   And he would say, OK, I want you to jump to me, right?
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.080]   And when you were really little, the jump
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.320]   meant dad just grabbed you and kind of pulled you in,
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:07.960]   and that was it.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.520]   Then he set you back, and pulled you in and set you back.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.440]   But eventually, he wanted you to take a jump.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.760]   And you're tiny, so this looks like the Pacific Ocean.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.720]   But you eventually decide whether or not
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.560]   you can trust your dad or not.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.000]   And I know some of you may not have been able to trust
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.240]   your dad or didn't have a dad.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.040]   But I knew I could trust my dad.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.440]   And I mean, I had an uncle that you couldn't trust.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.900]   And so he was the one that said jump, and then he was like,
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:31.160]   yeah!
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.400]   And then you're underwater.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.960]   And then he grabs you at the last second.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.200]   Hope you didn't have that guy.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.760]   But my dad, I knew I could trust him.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.240]   So I would just finally give it a little, here I go.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.200]   And boom, he had me.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.120]   And as time went on, things progressed.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.400]   I would take a few steps back and go airborne,
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.480]   like real airborne.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.040]   And he would grab me.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.800]   And then eventually, I didn't need dad,
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.080]   because I'd just back up as far as you could to the fence
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.640]   and run and go airborne on my own.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.920]   But when I started, I knew if I went airborne.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.520]   I knew two things about my dad.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.760]   I knew his heart was good.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.600]   And I knew his arms were strong.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.160]   And I knew that if I left the side of the pool,
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.560]   those two things were going to be the most important factors
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.480]   in the next few seconds.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.920]   My dad's heart is good.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.840]   And my dad's arms are strong.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.960]   Little scrawny kid like me, he just got you right back
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.000]   on the top.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.400]   And knowing that his heart was good and his arms were strong
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:40.800]   allowed me to take a step over the fear
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.200]   that I naturally felt.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.920]   So tonight, we're not trying to say you
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.320]   shouldn't be afraid of things.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.080]   No, things are scary.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.720]   What we're saying tonight is, do you
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.040]   realize that your heavenly father's heart is good
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.920]   and that his arms are strong?
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.400]   See, because what I think the enemy is doing
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.200]   as he's sliding in the back door or the side door
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.640]   and getting up to our table, where a lot of our lives,
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.520]   anxiety is just like-- it's like my little brother, my sister,
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.640]   my mom, my stepdad, and anxiety.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.040]   We just give anxiety a seat at the table.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.000]   It's like, that's just the way it is.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.040]   That's the way it's going to be.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.080]   And you just deal with it.
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:23.800]   You medicate.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.920]   You meditate.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.080]   You struggle.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.480]   You do whatever you got to do.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.880]   And I'm here to say that I do believe anxiety is real.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.000]   And I still struggle with anxiety,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.920]   because the hole I went down in, you
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.520]   don't come out of that without some major scars on your life.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.760]   And there are seasons where my anxiety is still
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.640]   a factor in my story.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:49.440]   But it's more like it's in Plano than it's suffocating me.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.880]   And I know it's in Plano.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.480]   It's going to be here in 45 minutes.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.400]   And I got 45 minutes to get my eyes back
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.000]   on a father whose heart is good and whose arms are strong.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.160]   So I don't know what it is I'm afraid of right now.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.360]   And it might be legitimate to have a fear of it.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.320]   But my father's heart is good.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.880]   And his arms are strong.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.840]   And I think what's happened is the enemy
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.360]   has come in the side door.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.960]   And it's reduced our view of God.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:21.680]   And I'm 100% on board with where we are tonight.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.000]   But I think we may have become the generation that
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.400]   has sung the song more than we actually believed the song.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.880]   Because we just sang about a big, holy, awesome God,
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.800]   a God that should put us on our knees,
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.880]   a God who is on a throne unrivaled.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.320]   You think he's concerned about anything today?
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.160]   You think he cares about the political climate in America?
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.240]   I mean, he cares about it.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.280]   But do you think it's bothering him at all?
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.160]   Do you think any global calamity has caused him to lose sleep?
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.360]   Do you think he has any rivals, any enemies, any problems,
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.600]   any shortage?
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:03.520]   He is sitting on a throne high and exalted.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.440]   And the train of his robe fills the temple.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.600]   And the walls and the doorposts shake
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:15.840]   when the angels say, holy, holy, holy is the Lord God almighty.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.000]   The whole earth is full of his glory.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.880]   And if you just were transported into that moment,
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.360]   you wouldn't do your best worship move.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.800]   You would go, ho, whoa.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:33.160]   And you wouldn't want to move.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.560]   You wouldn't want to look around.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.760]   You would be like, oh, I had no clue.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.600]   I had no idea.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.760]   I knew you were great.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.120]   But I kind of thought you were just a little higher than me
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.580]   and a little greater than me and a little stronger than me.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.800]   I had no idea that you were mind-blowingly awesome,
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.920]   that thunder and lightning emanate from your throne,
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.520]   and that beings forever have served
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:04.680]   the sole purpose of crying out your otherness.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:12.120]   Set apart, set apart, set apart is the Lord God almighty.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.760]   The way Isaiah said it, bringing it back down
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.880]   into our world in Isaiah 41, this
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.520]   is God speaking now through the prophet.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.960]   And he says in verse 10, so do not--
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:35.360]   here's our word-- fear, for I am with you.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.320]   Don't you love that?
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.680]   And again, I'm not saying that if you're
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.080]   struggling that you shouldn't reach out for help.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.920]   You should.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.240]   I'm not saying that if you're in a dark place
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.520]   that you shouldn't seek help.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.320]   Please do.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.600]   But God, when he comes into the story,
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.420]   primarily he doesn't say, I realize
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.680]   that things are difficult, and I don't want you to fear.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.240]   And here are the 19 principles about how you don't fear.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.320]   He said, don't fear.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.600]   I am here.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.880]   In other words, your awareness of me and your concept of me
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.200]   and your understanding of me, that's
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.440]   what puts fear to flight.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.960]   And when we learn the fear of God,
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.760]   we don't fear hardly anything else.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.560]   When we step into a relationship with God,
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.720]   that we are so stunned by him, you say,
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.960]   well, that sounds like a scary thing to have fear of God.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.880]   Listen, if we were in the presence of God,
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.540]   we would realize what it means to know the fear of the Lord.
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.520]   If we were like Isaiah, who had that vision that I just
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:50.460]   described, we would understand in one second what on Netflix
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.040]   doesn't fly in the throne room of God.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.720]   We would understand in a nanosecond
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.720]   what we have embraced in culture and sort of onboarded
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.920]   it as, you know, it's just part of living in a broken world.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.840]   No, not in the throne room of God.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.440]   Some of the language we use, not in the throne room of God.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.300]   Some of the things we laugh at, not in the throne room of God.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.480]   Some of the things we tolerate and accept,
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.000]   not in the throne room of God.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.440]   There is a fear of God that changes and transforms
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.600]   everything about us.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:23.520]   And the more we fear God, the less we fear everything else.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.000]   And so this is the way he's speaking to us.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.280]   He says, so do not fear, for I am with you.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:39.000]   Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.840]   Not just the God, I'm your God.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.280]   And here's what I'm going to do.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.240]   I'm going to strengthen you, and I'm going to help you,
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.480]   and I'm going to uphold you with my righteous right hand.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.520]   In other words, my heart is good and my arms are strong.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.200]   And I know what you're facing right now
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.920]   is incredibly uncertain.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.120]   I know that you cannot control the outcomes,
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.560]   and that's very frustrating to you.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.060]   I know that it doesn't feel like you can control anything
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.920]   right now, and that's ultimately, I think,
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.160]   the root of all of our fear is our inability
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.720]   to manage and control things.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.840]   And he's saying, hey, don't worry about it.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.840]   I am managing and I am controlling everything.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.160]   And my heart is good and my arms are strong, and I've got you.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.120]   I've got you.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.800]   So if you keep your eyes on me and not on whatever
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.720]   it is that the enemy is trying to make you afraid of,
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.480]   you are going to have confidence and peace welling up
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.800]   inside your heart.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.200]   Another way the psalmist said it,
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.800]   and I want to just let you see this passage
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.320]   because I love it so much, Psalm 34,
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.600]   because I just want to make sure you see that I'm not just
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.760]   telling you what I think.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.840]   This psalm's so great.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.400]   Let's just read a few verses together.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.640]   "I will extol the Lord at all times.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.360]   His praise will always be on my lips."
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.800]   And that's where I want us to end.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.240]   And I don't know if we'll have time
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.760]   to get the whole pit story in and end there,
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.800]   but the scripture says, "Put on the garment of praise
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.800]   for the spirit of heaviness."
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:10.800]   So ultimately, the dagger to fear is worship.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.600]   The dagger to anxiety is worship.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.320]   The dagger to depression is worship.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.000]   And when you're depressed, you don't want to worship.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.560]   And when you're anxious, you don't want to worship.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.460]   And when you're afraid, you don't want to worship.
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.780]   But that's the beauty and the paradox of God,
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.000]   is that when we get our eyes off of whatever's making us
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.600]   anxious and whatever we're afraid of,
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.440]   and whatever is causing us to be depressed
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.640]   and put our eyes back up on God
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.360]   and choose to open our mouths and worship Him,
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.520]   that is when the scripture says,
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.440]   "We start wearing the garment of praise
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.000]   and taking off the spirit of heaviness."
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.920]   And I'm telling you, worship is a weapon
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.760]   and it will take out the powers of the darkness.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.640]   "I will extol the Lord at all times.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.440]   His praise will always be on my lips.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.300]   My soul will boast in the Lord.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:02.240]   Let the afflicted hear and rejoice.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.760]   So glorify the Lord with me.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.400]   Let us exalt His name together.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.960]   I sought the Lord and He answered me."
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.500]   And this is the phrase that I really was sensing
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.640]   in my heart coming into tonight.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:20.600]   "He delivered me from all my fears."
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.360]   Not some of them, not most of them, not one of them,
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.960]   not just the weakest one of them,
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.620]   but He delivered me from all my fears.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.460]   How?
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.280]   Look at verse five.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.320]   "Those who look to Him are radiant
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.880]   and their faces are never covered with shame.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.000]   This poor man called and the Lord heard him.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.040]   He saved him out of all his troubles.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.880]   The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.920]   and He delivers them.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.760]   So taste and see that the Lord is good.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.920]   Blessed is the one who takes refuge in Him.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.440]   Fear the Lord, you His saints,
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:03.440]   for those who fear Him lack nothing."
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:10.200]   So tonight God's calling you to Himself.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.520]   He's not really calling you away from what you're afraid of.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.600]   He's calling you to Himself.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.960]   He's not really wanting to even negotiate
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.300]   around the situation that you can't control right now
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.600]   that's making you anxious.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.800]   He just wants to call you up and to Himself.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.880]   And He wants to renew in you a confidence in Him.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.680]   And He wants you to begin to speak that confidence
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.920]   into the circumstance and the situation
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.020]   that you're afraid of.
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:43.360]   I know for me, and every story is different,
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.320]   there's no one size fits all answer to any of the things
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.940]   that we're talking about in this series, by the way.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.480]   It's everybody's situation is slightly different
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.040]   in the way God wants to touch and heal and restore
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.560]   and deliver you is probably slightly different
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.580]   than the person next to you.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.680]   So it's not a, hey, here's the formula
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.160]   and do this and say this,
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.040]   and this is how you get free from anxiety
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.040]   and free from depression and free from fear.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.980]   But I know for me, I don't know how I got in that hole.
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.800]   I just woke up in the middle of the night one night
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.160]   and thought I was dying.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.640]   And the next night it was worse.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.560]   And eventually my wife drove me to the hospital
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.760]   at two in the morning.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.720]   And I was 50 years old at the time.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.000]   And I tell you how to get around the line
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.800]   at an emergency room is walk in, walk up to the desk
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.700]   and tell the person I'm 50 and I can't feel my face
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.220]   and my legs are pulsating and they've been doing that
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.460]   for a few hours now and I can't get them to stop
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.900]   and my arm is numb.
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.060]   Come right this way.
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:44.540]   And that night started a series that I just can't get into,
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.180]   but it was just craziness.
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.300]   I thought I was losing my mind.
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.300]   I mean, legitimately, I'm not using that as like hyperbole.
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.380]   I thought I was going crazy.
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.440]   And for several months, I was in and out
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.080]   of all these different doctor's offices
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.360]   and having all these pseudo symptoms
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.080]   and literally thinking things were happening to my body
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.520]   'cause my brain was in some kind of revolt against me.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.800]   And I didn't go out of the house.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.180]   I didn't go to meetings at church.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.400]   I didn't walk into cul-de-sac with my wife.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   I mean, I was just in a ball in the corner for months.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.720]   And I'd been to every kind of doctor
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.480]   and had all kinds of people pray for me
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.060]   and prayed for myself,
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.280]   but just every single night, it was the same thing.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.000]   I'd go to sleep finally and I could manage the days okay,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.120]   but the nights were a train wreck.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.420]   And two o'clock would come and I mean, I would be awake.
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:43.040]   I mean, on the nose, like it's two o'clock
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.640]   and I'm staring at the ceiling,
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.740]   feeling like something is suffocating me.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.960]   And after a week or two, it was just weird.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.020]   And then after a month or two, it was devastating.
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.660]   And about four or five months in,
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.720]   it became completely debilitating.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.760]   And when two o'clock came on this night,
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.120]   I'll never forget it.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:11.120]   I just, I felt so frail and so weak and so helpless.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.520]   Shelley's asleep in the bed next to me.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.540]   And I just raised my hands up to God.
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:23.540]   And I said, God, I cannot do this one more night.
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:28.600]   And I wasn't contemplating an ultimate decision that night.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.120]   I just was at, I was at the end.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.040]   When people say you're at your wits end,
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:34.880]   that's where I was.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.840]   There was, I could not see one more hour
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.520]   or one more day or one more morning
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.000]   or certainly not another night of this business.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.640]   And then out of my spirit came a verse of scripture.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.900]   See, that's why it's so important
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.780]   to put the word in your heart,
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:50.820]   because in the right moment,
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.540]   the Holy Spirit will bring that word out of your heart.
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.180]   And we'd been in a season in my family years before
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.540]   where our whole family had gone through a valley
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.940]   of the shadow of death.
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:03.380]   And for months, we'd gone through a really crazy season.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:07.460]   And at night, this passage from Job
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:10.900]   with sort of my light to help me keep moving.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.540]   Then there's a little verse in Job that says,
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:16.940]   "The Lord who gives songs in the night."
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:20.340]   And so I knew that verse somewhere was way down in there,
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.100]   but this night as I lifted up my hands
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.780]   on what was kind of for me, my last night,
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.420]   that verse just, the Holy Spirit just brought it up
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.340]   out of my heart.
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.820]   And all of a sudden I realized,
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.540]   God, you give songs in the night
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.820]   and I've never been in a darker night right now.
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.380]   And I don't know why I'm saying this
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.380]   and I don't feel like it and it doesn't make any sense,
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.480]   but if you'll give me a song, I'll sing it to you right now.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.260]   And a spontaneous song dropped into my heart,
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.720]   just like that.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.940]   I mean, I couldn't put a sentence together,
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.240]   but all of a sudden a little song dropped into my heart.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.280]   You're like, well, you know,
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.840]   you were a part of Passion back then.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.600]   You could have picked "How Great Is Our God,"
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.300]   or you could have picked a Big Matt Redmond song,
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.280]   or, you know, there were a lot of songs to choose from.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.200]   I know, but I wasn't thinking clearly.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.560]   And this little song dropped into my heart,
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.920]   this little set of phrases.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.080]   And I sang them.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.760]   It was not a verse, chorus, verse, chorus,
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.000]   chorus, chorus, bridge, chorus.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.520]   It was just four lines.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.680]   And I'm not kidding you,
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.060]   I bet I said or sang those four lines until sun up.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:31.560]   You're like, I know where this is going.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.920]   And you woke up and you were healed.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.800]   And you got up and got dressed and went to work
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.440]   and y'all had a praise party at the office that day.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.760]   Nope.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.320]   Thought I was going crazy the next day.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.880]   Went to bed, but when two o'clock came
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.680]   and it did come the next night, I was already prepared.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.940]   I had four lines.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:55.240]   And I sang them into that cloud the second night.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:59.760]   And the third night, and the fourth night,
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:04.320]   and the fifth night, it was cloud, song.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.760]   Here comes the cloud, I have a song.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.720]   Here comes the cloud.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.000]   And I would just say to God,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.660]   God, you didn't heal me yesterday.
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.820]   You didn't heal me the day before.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.600]   You didn't heal me today.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.780]   I don't know if you're gonna heal me tomorrow.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:24.000]   But I do know this, you are a healer.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.640]   And so I just say to myself again,
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.080]   be still my soul, there's a healer.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.640]   His love is deeper than the sea.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.120]   His mercy is unending.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:37.200]   His arms are refuge for the weak.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.920]   That was my song.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:43.200]   And then it turned into two o'clock, song.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.520]   Song cloud.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:51.080]   And then it was just song, song, cloud,
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.480]   song, song, song, cloud, song, cloud,
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.160]   song, song, song, song, song.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:00.160]   And I'm telling you that act of worship
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:06.520]   pierced the darkness and led me into the light.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:12.160]   You're like, that is so too simple.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:19.560]   I know, it's simple like put on the garment of praise
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.820]   for the spirit of heaviness.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:26.800]   How complicated is that?
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.840]   Not at all.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:32.840]   But it's you deciding by the power of God
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.080]   and through the grace of Jesus
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.820]   that anxiety, fear, depression, they are real.
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:41.640]   Can we just say that?
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.880]   They are real and they can take you out.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:49.040]   But they are not bigger than Jesus.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:54.920]   And they don't hold a candle
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:34:00.200]   to the great I am who is sitting on the throne of thrones.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.320]   And I'm telling you,
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.360]   I don't know what your experience has been with your dad,
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.080]   but I'm telling you about this father,
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:10.080]   his heart is good and his arms are strong
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:15.080]   and you can trust him.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.160]   (congregation applauding)
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:22.860]   On the basis of the cross of Jesus, you can trust him.
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.440]   On the basis of the cross of Christ,
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.240]   you can believe that he can take the worst
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.720]   and make something good.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.200]   On the basis of the cross of Christ,
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.240]   you can believe that the worst day on earth
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.200]   can become in some way in God's economy,
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.720]   the greatest day on earth.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:47.920]   And based on the authority of the finished work of Jesus
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.320]   on the cross, you can believe,
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.880]   you can choose tonight to believe
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.240]   that whatever your past has been
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:57.000]   does not define what your future is going to be.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.880]   And I know we've sung corporately here,
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.880]   but that's not the same as having a song of praise for you.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.120]   Coming into the porch or coming to church on Sunday
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.240]   or putting your tunes on in your car.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.000]   It's not the same as getting down on your knees
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.400]   in the dark place and say,
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:15.080]   "God, I choose to praise you right here and right now."
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.360]   Anyone and everyone can praise God in the noonday sun,
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.880]   but when you worship God at the midnight hour,
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.460]   your worship is a wrecking ball to the power of hell.
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.640]   And the scripture says,
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.400]   "The power of life and death is in the tongue
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.700]   and the power of your life and your death is in the tongue."
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.780]   And we gotta stop listening to the enemy.
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:36.620]   We gotta say,
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.700]   "I'm sorry you're not welcome at my table anymore
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.820]   in Jesus' name."
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.700]   You apparently can prowl around, but you cannot sit down.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:47.380]   This table is prepared by my shepherd for me.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.880]   Yes, in the middle of the battle,
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.980]   but it is a table he has prepared for me.
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:52.980]   I'm sitting with the king.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:53.980]   Thank you very much.
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.840]   I got my eyes locked on Jesus.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.860]   Thank you very much.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.080]   I'm getting my cues from the great I am.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.020]   Thank you very much.
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.780]   So I'm not gonna go to coffee with you
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:02.740]   and you say, "How's it going?"
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:05.100]   And I'm going, "I don't know, man.
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.540]   I don't know."
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.460]   'Cause I'm at a table with a king
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.280]   and one thing Jesus has never said
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.100]   in the history of history is, "I don't know, man."
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:16.860]   Words have never come out of his mouth.
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.260]   Do you think we're gonna be able to fix this?
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.700]   I don't know, man.
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.800]   You think we can solve this?
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:22.640]   I don't know, man.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.940]   You think we're gonna be able to survive?
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:25.540]   I don't know, man.
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:27.300]   And I'll tell you something else he's never told me.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.520]   Never, never, never, never has Jesus said to me,
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.220]   "You're not gonna make it, Louie."
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.860]   So if we're at coffee and you say, "How are you doing?"
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.620]   And I say, "I don't know, man.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.660]   I don't know if I'm gonna make it."
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.100]   Where did I get that?
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.580]   I got that from the enemy who's pulled up a chair
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:45.980]   at my table and told me one more time,
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.660]   "You're not gonna make it through this."
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.720]   And I not only listened to him, I am now repeating him.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.840]   So I need a new story.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.040]   You need a new story.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.780]   Not some, again, some, you know, like feel good story.
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.340]   You just need truth.
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.420]   Even though I walk through the valley
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:08.540]   of the shadow of death, I'm not gonna fear evil.
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:09.980]   Why? 'Cause I'm strong and tough?
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.340]   No.
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:12.620]   'Cause I'm big and bold?
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:13.460]   No.
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.020]   'Cause I've got major courage?
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:18.700]   No, because you are with me
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:22.360]   and your rod and staff,
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.480]   that's what's bringing me comfort tonight.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.420]   You realize Jesus isn't just meek and mild
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:28.380]   with a little shepherd's crook.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.740]   Get the little sheep when they go off the path.
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.380]   He's got a rod in the other hand
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.840]   and he can take it and destroy a bear or a wolf
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:39.220]   or a lion or a prey that comes out of the woods
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.740]   for your neck.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.460]   And he says, "Oh no, no, not her.
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:44.300]   Nope."
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:48.440]   And that's who gives me comfort.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:54.500]   Tonight's invitation isn't to get more courage
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:58.620]   so you can overcome your fear.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:01.420]   It's to embrace more faith
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.660]   that the God who is with you and in you
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.840]   is greater than it all.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.660]   He's greater than it all.
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.700]   - He sure is.
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:17.680]   - And someone here tonight,
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:23.420]   it's time for you to open your mouth
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:30.220]   in what seems counter intuitive to every human thought,
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:33.180]   like all the things in the kingdom,
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:37.900]   and to sing a song of praise
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.800]   to a God who is great and awesome,
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:46.340]   no matter what circumstances around you.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:48.740]   I'm gonna put my eyes on you
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.500]   and I'm gonna open my mouth to praise you
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:55.260]   and the situation may or may not change today,
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:58.460]   but I'm gonna change.
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:02.580]   As soon as my mouth is filled with your praise
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:07.840]   and my eyes are locked on your face.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:14.700]   It took a few months for me just to close the story.
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:19.700]   It did take a doctor and medication and a lot of prayer.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:25.140]   And a few more months after that song in the night
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:30.140]   for me to feel like I come back into life again.
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:33.900]   It probably took a good year
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.040]   before I felt like I could sprint at full speed
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.040]   and do all the things I could do before
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.640]   without having to worry as anxiety coming
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.280]   and shutting me down again today.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:45.860]   So it's a process.
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.140]   So quick fixes, no easy prayers tonight.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.680]   No, I'm gonna raise my hand at the porch
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:53.140]   and eight years of depression are just gonna evaporate.
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.980]   No, you're gonna have to start a process
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.260]   and I'm closing right now.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:00.200]   You're gonna have to start a process, but you can.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.020]   God brought me here tonight
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:07.220]   so you could look with your own eyes
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:11.620]   at someone who's been down at the bottom,
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:15.620]   but is standing right in front of you by the grace of God
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:20.220]   to tell you from the other side, you are not crazy.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:26.420]   Oh, there may be some crazy in it, but you are not crazy.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:31.380]   And you are going to make it.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:36.200]   You are going to make it.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:42.440]   The shepherd said he's going to lead you through
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.540]   and you're gonna make it.
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:51.280]   I'm inviting you to change your story right now.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:56.220]   And let anxiety be in the mix for a minute,
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.860]   but get it off the throne.
[00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:03.240]   Let depression be in the story, but get it off the throne.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.740]   And everything else is on the throne.
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.060]   If you have alcoholism in your family,
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.660]   it's all your family talks about, right?
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.440]   The whole thing, the rehab, the other rehab,
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.700]   the thing, the deal, the deal, the deal,
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.180]   this happened, that happened, the other thing.
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:17.100]   And before we know it, we're just worshiping alcoholism.
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:20.520]   Our family has been down that road too.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:25.820]   Your parents bailed out on you and all of a sudden,
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.000]   it's just everything that didn't go right
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.020]   and all the hurt and all the pain and all the loss
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.220]   and the frustration and the anger that built up
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.780]   and the bitterness and the resentment.
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.360]   And before you know it, your family breaking up
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.420]   is on the throne and that's what's getting worshiped.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:40.900]   What do you mean that's what's getting worshiped?
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.300]   That's what I talk about all the time.
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.900]   I'm always talking about the breakup or the depression
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.780]   or about the loss or about what happened.
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:52.020]   And hey, all this stuff did happen,
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:55.260]   but at the end of the day, we gotta start worshiping God.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:57.740]   He needs to be getting the conversation.
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.420]   He needs to be getting the oxygen in the room.
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.060]   He needs to be getting the attention.
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.060]   We're not denying stuff has gone down.
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.820]   We're just remembering that God is still lifted up.
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:10.740]   And you have the power tonight to change your story.
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.940]   You don't have to, and most people in your culture,
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.100]   your generation are not going to.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.140]   They're gonna keep that story on them.
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.460]   They're gonna keep themselves right at the center of it.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.020]   They're gonna find an individual narrative
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:25.220]   and they're gonna write out that story.
[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:26.320]   And in the process of that,
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.620]   they're never gonna live in freedom,
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:28.660]   never gonna walk in the light,
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.100]   never gonna experience all of what God has for them.
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.700]   You can change your story.
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:37.140]   God, I pray tonight
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.340]   for revelation.
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:48.920]   I know that there are people struggling in this room.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.320]   I can see it on their faces
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.660]   as I'm looking around the room.
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.620]   I can see the fight,
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:59.860]   people hanging on by their fingertips.
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.980]   I can see people,
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:07.580]   this young lady particularly,
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.700]   and I can just see on her face
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.660]   that she wants to believe what you're saying tonight,
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:13.860]   but she just can't.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:17.620]   She feels like if she believes it again,
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.180]   it's gonna be another letdown.
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:30.560]   So to the degree that the enemy is lying
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.780]   and stealing and destroying,
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:37.620]   to the degree that he is not only at our table,
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:38.940]   but eating our lunch,
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:44.940]   I speak the name that is above every name.
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:50.140]   I speak the name of Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:53.700]   who is risen in power and glory,
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:58.400]   and who has broken every curse and every chain.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.300]   I speak in the name of Jesus
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:07.420]   that these are your sons and daughters.
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.380]   They are born again, those in Christ,
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:15.380]   to new life and are now in a new family tree.
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:19.780]   They are not stuck with an earthly paradigm,
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:24.780]   but they are children of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:29.740]   Their 23 in me got reduced to three in me.
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:34.740]   It's God birthing sons and daughters to brand new life.
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:38.220]   I speak in Jesus' name,
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.220]   the distance that you span from heaven to earth
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:45.740]   to pursue, to redeem, to set free,
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.980]   to exchange when you gave your life
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.180]   to declare our worth to God.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.300]   And I pray that people will receive it.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:58.180]   I pray, Lord, that you will jettison us
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:00.580]   from the victim mentality tonight
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:04.340]   and move us into the victory of God.
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:07.980]   I pray that you will move us into the victor story
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:11.460]   because we are riding with you.
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:16.180]   And we do pray against depression.
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:18.460]   I pray against the spirit of suicide.
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:23.260]   I pray against the spirit of insignificance,
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.900]   irrelevance, the person who thinks
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.540]   that no one would even know if they left this planet.
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:32.260]   I pray against every lie that has come from the pit of hell.
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.620]   I surrender tonight and just say,
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.860]   God, I'm not in control of hardly anything,
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.820]   but I am in control of whether or not
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.620]   I'm gonna believe that you are in control.
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:45.340]   So tonight I just affirm again that my God is in control.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:50.220]   Your heart is good and your arms are strong for me.
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:56.980]   If that's landing in your heart tonight
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:59.380]   in a very personal way, in a powerful way,
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:04.340]   I just wanna invite you just to stand into this moment.
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.580]   It's no magic in standing.
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:07.260]   We don't have anything for you to fill out.
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:11.140]   There's no, you know, there's nothing necessarily
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:14.140]   about that other than you just being defiant tonight
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:16.100]   and saying, I'm choosing right now
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.660]   to change the narrative of my story
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:21.500]   and to put my eyes on Jesus.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.740]   We're all gonna sing to him.
[00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:24.260]   We're all gonna worship him together.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:25.940]   But I wonder if there's anybody in the building
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:27.740]   that this has landed for you
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.180]   specifically into your story tonight.
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:34.020]   If you'd just stand right where you are just for a moment,
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:35.820]   I'm gonna pray for you specifically.
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:56.420]   God, I thank you for every person
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:58.420]   that's standing before you tonight.
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:03.180]   Every valuable life, every precious soul.
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:07.020]   I thank you that you see them and you know them.
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.340]   You could call them by their first name,
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.140]   their middle name, their last name.
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.580]   You know their birth date, you know their death date,
[00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:16.100]   you know every single thing about their lives.
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:18.460]   And I thank you tonight that you have connected
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.940]   your truth to their lives in a very powerful
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.220]   and a very personal way.
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:26.500]   Lord, I'm just gonna pray for you
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.420]   and I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.820]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.420]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.220]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:36.820]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.620]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.420]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.220]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:44.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:46.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:48.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:50.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:00.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:08.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:20.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.020]   I'm gonna pray for you tonight.
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.020]   I am walking in power.
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:28.020]   I am moving in my gifts.
[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:32.020]   And I'm watching God do the supernatural in my life.
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:34.020]   Lord, we thank you for that.
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:36.020]   And we give you thanks.
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:38.020]   And we give you praise for it.
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.020]   In the mighty name of Jesus.
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:42.020]   And everybody says,
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:44.020]   Amen.
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.020]   Amen.
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.020]   Amen.
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.020]   Amen.
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.020]   Let's worship Him together.
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:56.020]   There's a verse in Isaiah chapter 26, verse 3,
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.020]   that says, "You keep in perfect peace
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:00.020]   him whose mind is stayed on you."
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:04.020]   That verse has, for so many years,
[00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:06.020]   felt so impossible to me.
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.020]   You keep in perfect peace?
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:14.020]   The one whose mind is fixed on God.
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.020]   And I shared this a couple weeks ago.
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:20.020]   In this season of thinking and praying
[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:22.020]   and studying on anxiety,
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.020]   it's like that began to click,
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:26.020]   and it connects so much to what Louis just shared.
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.020]   It's like the more that I have my eyes fixed around the fact
[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:30.020]   that my Father,
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:32.020]   His heart is good.
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:36.020]   And His hands and His arms are strong.
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:40.020]   That no matter what I walk through,
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:44.020]   He may not always heal it in the time frame,
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:48.020]   in the way that I want.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:50.020]   But He is enough.
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.020]   And whatever you are walking through, He is enough.
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:54.020]   He wants to meet you where you are at,
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.020]   and come alongside,
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.020]   and for you to know, you have a Father
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.020]   whose heart is good,
[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:02.020]   and whose hands are strong.
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.020]   And you're going to leave this room,
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:06.020]   and the world around you,
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:08.020]   like a kid at the pool,
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:10.020]   is going to say, "You can't trust Him.
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:12.020]   You shouldn't trust Him.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:14.020]   You shouldn't trust Him."
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:16.020]   And all these messages.
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.020]   But you need to remember,
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:20.020]   as you walk through the valley of the shadow of fill-in-the-blank,
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:22.020]   His heart is good.
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.020]   He is enough.
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.020]   And you're going to make it, because His hands are strong.
[00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:28.020]   If you've never had a moment
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.020]   where you've trusted in Christ,
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:32.020]   and by that I mean you have accepted
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:34.020]   Jesus' death
[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.020]   as payment on the cross for your sin.
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.020]   Everything past, everything present,
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:40.020]   everything you don't even know you're going to do
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.020]   three months from now, paid for.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:44.020]   All of it nailed to the cross.
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:46.020]   You're not a Christian.
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:48.020]   You've never taken the step to become a Christian,
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:50.020]   which is not something you do,
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.020]   it's something you receive by faith in Jesus.
[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:54.020]   Tonight is your night, and we'd love to pray with you.
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:56.020]   If you're walking through a time where you're just in a hard season,
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:58.020]   and we can come along,
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:00.020]   and we can pray with you.
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:02.020]   If there's any way that we can serve
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:04.020]   whatever you're going through, we'd love to do that,
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:06.020]   and we have an entire team that'll be down front.
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:08.020]   Maybe you're not in a place where you're ready to make that decision,
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:10.020]   you just have questions,
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.020]   and they're normal, understandable questions.
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:14.020]   When you study scripture,
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:16.020]   it doesn't all click.
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:18.020]   We create an environment every month called Great Questions,
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:20.020]   where you can go right down this hall, right over here,
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.020]   and there's a room of our friends
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:24.020]   that is designed for you to ask questions
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:28.020]   on your journey, wherever you are in the faith.
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:30.020]   Finally, we do something called First Step,
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.020]   where if you don't have a church home, welcome home.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:34.020]   We want to help you take the first step
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:36.020]   in making a place that feels so big,
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.020]   feel a lot smaller, so you can take your first step
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:40.020]   into getting connected here,
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:42.020]   right outside of these doors, up in the loft,
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.020]   outside of here. If you have a church home,
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:46.020]   we're not here to steal Christians,
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:48.020]   we want you to go deeper in wherever God has you,
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.020]   and be His people there.
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:52.020]   Finally, I've got two requests.
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:56.020]   One is, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.020]   there is a conference called Passion Conference.
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.020]   If you haven't heard of it,
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:02.020]   and you've been under a rock,
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:04.020]   you need to go to passion2022.com
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.020]   and find out.
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:08.020]   It's an amazing gathering
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.020]   of 60,000 college students
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:12.020]   and young adults
[00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:14.020]   that will be gathering
[00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:16.020]   in January of this year.
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:18.020]   That's too small for me to read.
[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:20.020]   January 2nd and 3rd.
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:22.020]   Oh, it's a lot bigger up there.
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.020]   January 2nd and 3rd.
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:26.020]   And I'm telling you, this is my request.
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:28.020]   If you are in college,
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.020]   you need to go to that conference.
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:32.020]   There's a Ports discount code,
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:34.020]   where tonight you get a steep discount
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.020]   for $109, which is
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:38.020]   losing money on you
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:40.020]   that they are basically giving for you to be,
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:42.020]   because they believe in this generation.
[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:44.020]   If you are not in college,
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:46.020]   and maybe you're like, "Man, I'm 28.
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.020]   I don't even know where I fit in
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.020]   in all of this."
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:52.020]   Welcome here, you fit in here.
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:54.020]   But you know some college students,
[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.020]   and I'm asking you to do something very specifically.
[00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:58.020]   I want you, if you know someone that needs to be there,
[00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:00.020]   I want you to buy their ticket, and I want you to text them
[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:02.020]   and say, "Hey, bro. Hey, sis.
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:04.020]   I got plans for you. January 2nd and 3rd.
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:06.020]   In Atlanta. Louis came and made a trip out here,
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:08.020]   and I want you to go make a trip and go see him."
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:10.020]   And you won't be
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:12.020]   at all regretting that you did.
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.020]   And so, if you're in college
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:16.020]   18 to 24,
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:18.020]   you should be there.
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:20.020]   And you'll be glad you did.
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.020]   And if you're not in that age frame,
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:24.020]   I want you to prayerfully consider sending it,
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.020]   because it just may change someone's life.
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:28.020]   I've heard it over and over
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.020]   and over.
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:32.020]   So use the promo code PORTS tonight.
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:34.020]   Finally.
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:36.020]   Everything that I said about
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:38.020]   history books and that with Louis and his team
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:40.020]   is not an overstatement.
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:42.020]   And so I want you guys
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:44.020]   to help me thank, not just for him traveling
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:46.020]   and being away from family tonight, but the
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.020]   investment he has made
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:50.020]   on so many generations,
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:52.020]   or on multiple generations,
[00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:54.020]   of this generation.
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:56.020]   And thank him also for being here tonight.
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:58.020]   So we thank Louis and his team one more time.
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:00.600]   (upbeat music)
