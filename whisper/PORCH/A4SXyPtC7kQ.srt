1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
 (eerie music)

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:15,440
 Are you scared?

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,360
 You should be.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,580
 Hey, can I just say, I just want you to know,

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,060
 and wherever you're listening from,

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,920
 whether you're here in Dallas or at another campus,

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,000
 what a privilege it is.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,720
 As I was singing and worshiping

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,500
 and just sitting here with you,

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,160
 just thinking, man, what a privilege

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,880
 that so many young adults would give their life

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,800
 to worshiping God.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,160
 And I know some of you are visitors and guests,

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,560
 and you may not know this God

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,020
 that we're singing to and talking to,

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,380
 but I just, I want you to know

17
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,220
 that I consider it a great privilege

18
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,720
 to get to open the word with you this evening.

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,440
 How many of you are here for the very first time?

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,480
 Like, it's okay, no big deal,

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,840
 I'm not gonna make you stand up and sing or anything.

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,880
 Okay, that's a lot, a lot of you

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,380
 is here for the very first time.

24
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,160
 Yeah, that's awesome, man, praise God.

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,400
 Welcome.

26
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,760
 Hey, welcome home, welcome to our home, I mean that.

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,920
 I pray you'd make it your home,

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,060
 and we're so glad you're with us.

29
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,520
 Usually when you visit a church,

30
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,800
 you know, they talk of one of two things.

31
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,560
 It's either money or hell, right?

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,920
 They're talking about one of those things,

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,160
 and we're not talking about money, so let's go.

34
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,840
 (congregation laughing)

35
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,180
 I wanna start with just a story that happened to me

36
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,880
 when my oldest daughter was two and a half years old,

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,280
 and she was kinda going through that terrible two phase

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,700
 that I'm sure you guys have heard about,

39
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,080
 and so she's about two and a half, she's a good kid,

40
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,320
 but going through a rough phase,

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,680
 and I had had a rough day, you know,

42
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,420
 and so really busy, back-to-back meetings,

43
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,760
 and then my truck broke down,

44
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,160
 kind of right in the middle of that,

45
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,600
 and so, you know, I took,

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,320
 there's never a good time for your car to break down,

47
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,120
 so I take my truck to the mechanic,

48
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,560
 and I'm sitting there in the waiting room,

49
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,880
 and they finished doing whatever they needed to do,

50
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,960
 so I was gonna be back on the road.

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,800
 That was good news,

52
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,440
 the only good news this particular day,

53
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,640
 and as I go to pay the bill,

54
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,960
 there's a bowl of lollipops right there,

55
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,300
 and so this is what's true

56
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,180
 about my two and a half year old at the time.

57
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,700
 Nobody has ever loved anything

58
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,700
 as much as she loves lollipops.

59
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,180
 I mean, it's weird, this weird obsession,

60
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,800
 and so you could think about something that you love,

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,420
 think about whether you have it, or you really want it,

62
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,180
 but she just has this crazy, strange obsession

63
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,900
 for lollipops at this time in her life,

64
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,620
 and so I see that bowl, and just like any good dad would do,

65
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,180
 you know, I grabbed one for her,

66
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,640
 and I took that, and I put it in my coat pocket

67
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,900
 on this particular day,

68
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,180
 and then I'm on my way home,

69
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,780
 and so I called Monica, my wife, on the way home,

70
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,980
 and she kind of answers the phone,

71
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,260
 and my wife's usually cheerful and full of joy,

72
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,460
 and she's kind of, "Hello," you know,

73
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,740
 "I could tell something was wrong."

74
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,580
 I'm like, "What's wrong?"

75
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,380
 She's like, "Oh, Presley just had a rough day today,"

76
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,860
 and I'm like, "Well, what do you mean?"

77
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,260
 Presley's my daughter, two and a half.

78
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,100
 "Well, what do you mean?"

79
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,580
 And she's like, "Well, she just wasn't kind to her sister,

80
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,320
 "and she made some bad choices,

81
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,780
 "and then she was disrespectful,"

82
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,900
 and we kind of have this rule in our home.

83
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,740
 If you get in trouble with mommy multiple times,

84
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,540
 then you get in trouble with daddy

85
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,860
 when he gets home, and so I'm thinking,

86
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,540
 "Hey, after this long, rough day,

87
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,140
 "the first thing I'm gonna have to do

88
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,740
 "when I get home is discipline my daughter,"

89
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,100
 which is unfortunate, right?

90
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,700
 And so I keep going on the way home,

91
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,900
 and I get there, and I walk in,

92
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,960
 and I sit Presley down, and I just say,

93
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,540
 "Hey, you know, what's going on?

94
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,180
 "What did you do today?"

95
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,540
 And she said, "Daddy, I had a rough day."

96
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,960
 And I, two and a half, and I said,

97
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,480
 "Man, it's hard to be two and a half," you know?

98
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,800
 And I just said, "Well, what did you do?"

99
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,240
 She said, "I made some poor choices today."

100
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,160
 And I said, "Oh, I hate to hear that."

101
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,000
 I said, "Well, what did you do?"

102
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,840
 And she said, "You know, I was disrespectful to mommy,

103
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,320
 "and I talked back, and I was mean to Finley,

104
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,840
 "and I did," she begins to list out those things.

105
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,820
 I said, "Man, that's such a bummer, man," you know?

106
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,720
 And I said, "'Cause look, you know, I saw this today,"

107
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,600
 and I pulled that out, and her eyes got this big.

108
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,760
 (laughing)

109
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,720
 And she's like, "Daddy, Daddy, is that for me?"

110
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,240
 I was like, "Oh, I got it for you."

111
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,960
 She's like, "Daddy, can I have it?

112
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,680
 "Can I have it, can I have it?"

113
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,880
 I said, "No," I said, "You can't have it.

114
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,040
 "See, I got this for you, but I can't give it to you.

115
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,800
 "I can't come home and reward you for your behavior,

116
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,160
 "and so I'm afraid you're not gonna get that."

117
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,000
 And she looks at me and she goes,

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,240
 (growling)

119
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,760
 "I can do whatever I want!"

120
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,000
 (laughing)

121
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:36,520
 Really?

122
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,240
 And I'm thinking, you know,

123
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,880
 I never learned how to do an exorcism.

124
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,720
 I don't know.

125
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,920
 (laughing)

126
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,040
 What just happened?

127
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,580
 What just happened?

128
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,580
 And I said, "You can,"

129
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,500
 and so let me just pause,

130
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,140
 'cause I've got some options now as a dad.

131
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,180
 I've got some things, I've got like a quiver

132
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,380
 full of disciplinary actions I can take.

133
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,540
 I'm like, is it spanking, is it hand, or is it spoon,

134
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,540
 or maybe we go belt for this one,

135
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,780
 or maybe, you know, you can sit in that chair,

136
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,980
 you know, for the rest of your life,

137
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,860
 or it's corner, or quiet time, timeout,

138
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,620
 or maybe you're grounded from prom.

139
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,380
 I'm thinking, like, what am I gonna do?

140
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,140
 But let me, as I walk through the options,

141
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,340
 like, let me tell you what I didn't do.

142
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,660
 Like, imagine if I would've been like,

143
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,600
 hey, come with me.

144
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,020
 Let's go to the front door,

145
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,660
 and I open the door,

146
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,740
 and I put her on the other side of it,

147
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,340
 and I say, "Man, it's been really fun being your dad,

148
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,420
 "but this is the end."

149
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,820
 (laughing)

150
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,820
 Yeah, this is where it stops,

151
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,980
 and so you go that way, I'm gonna go this way,

152
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,580
 no hard feelings, and you know.

153
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,820
 Yeah, I wouldn't do that, right?

154
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,020
 'Cause like, some of you are like,

155
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,900
 how can you even say that, you know?

156
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,420
 And I was like, I would never do that.

157
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,340
 I would never be like, hey, you wanna do that,

158
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,460
 then we're done, no more communication forever,

159
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,740
 'cause that wouldn't be a loving dad.

160
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,740
 That wouldn't be, but isn't that what God does?

161
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,060
 Isn't that kind of the doctrine of hell?

162
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,160
 That because you've done something wrong here,

163
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,340
 that at some point when you die,

164
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,860
 he cuts you off forever, there's separation,

165
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,740
 no more communication, and not just that,

166
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,860
 but you probably heard some pretty horrific things,

167
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,660
 and lots of pain, and agony, and torment,

168
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,020
 and suffering, and fire, and all the things

169
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,420
 that we think of when we think of hell.

170
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:38,860
 And so I wanna be really honest with you tonight.

171
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,980
 We're moving into a series called The Afterlife,

172
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,180
 what happens to you when you die.

173
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,340
 And my concern for us is we don't really deal

174
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,780
 with the topic of death a lot.

175
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,400
 Like back in the day, someone would die

176
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,460
 right in the living room, they would die in the bedroom,

177
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,860
 they would die in the home, and you would handle the body,

178
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,740
 and you would dig a hole in the back pasture,

179
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,980
 and you would bury them, and you would see it.

180
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,740
 Most of us have never even been in the room

181
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,660
 when someone dies.

182
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,900
 It's very peripheral to our life today.

183
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,140
 It's very marginal from where we're at.

184
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,460
 We've outsourced that to the medical industry

185
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,500
 here in America, so we don't think about death a lot.

186
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,740
 Like a lot of you, maybe you're in your 20s,

187
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,300
 and hell or heaven feels like a really long ways off.

188
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,020
 But can I tell you something?

189
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,100
 I had a friend die this week.

190
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,120
 An untimely death, pneumonia.

191
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,540
 Took a turn for the worse.

192
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,780
 Nobody saw it coming.

193
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,980
 You have no idea when you're going to die,

194
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,580
 and because you exist now,

195
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,940
 you will exist somewhere forever.

196
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,180
 And we've got to deal with this doctrine,

197
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,420
 and I hate it, man, I hate it.

198
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,740
 I wish we didn't have to.

199
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,740
 I mean, we all know, I hate that some of you

200
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,460
 listening to this right now will be in hell one day.

201
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,740
 The weight of that is overwhelming to me.

202
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,460
 And you have friends that will be there,

203
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,660
 we have family that will be there,

204
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,940
 and the weight of that, if we really grasped it,

205
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:10,400
 would be completely overwhelming and terrifying to us.

206
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,240
 But we have to talk about it

207
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,600
 because the Bible talks about it.

208
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,860
 And so as we start this series,

209
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,640
 we're gonna start with option one, and that is hell.

210
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,360
 And I wanna teach you truth from the Scriptures.

211
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,920
 Jesus talked more about hell

212
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,160
 than everyone else in the Bible combined.

213
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,080
 More than half of his parables

214
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,640
 highlighted the doctrine of hell.

215
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,080
 He talked a lot about this.

216
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,160
 And so I do, as I said, I wish I could change this, right?

217
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,720
 And if you want to hear that it's not real

218
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,300
 and there's not a hell and you're not gonna go there,

219
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,560
 you don't have to go far.

220
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,160
 People are constantly trying to erase this doctrine.

221
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,000
 Rob Bell wrote a book called "Love Wins"

222
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,040
 that had a lot of traction and people listened to it

223
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,740
 because it was popular

224
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,420
 because there was some confusing ideas in it about hell.

225
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,160
 And then maybe you heard about the Pope's interview

226
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,840
 last week that made national news,

227
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,560
 that he said there is no hell.

228
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,700
 Now, I don't know if he said it or not.

229
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,400
 The Vatican issued a statement after the fact

230
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,700
 kind of recanting some of that.

231
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,400
 I don't know what happened there,

232
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,560
 but I will tell you, if you want to find somebody

233
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,180
 who says there is no hell, you will not have to go far,

234
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,320
 but you will not hear that from Jesus.

235
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,140
 When God was on the earth, he talked about hell a lot.

236
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,660
 He wanted you to know about it.

237
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,840
 And I think we have this obsession in some ways

238
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,800
 with the afterlife.

239
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,240
 Like whether somebody spends 23 minutes in hell

240
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,800
 or Colton Burpo's writing "Heaven is for Real,"

241
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,600
 I want you to know that hell is for real

242
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,460
 too.

243
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,800
 I think this is one of the reasons,

244
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,240
 you know, that the movie right now,

245
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,100
 I can only imagine, by mercy me,

246
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,120
 that song was so popular because it's talking about

247
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,500
 what happens in the afterlife.

248
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,820
 We have an obsession about it.

249
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,760
 And tonight I want you to know what is real.

250
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,620
 There's lots of different beliefs.

251
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,960
 I'll go through some of them real quick.

252
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,000
 There's the belief of naturalism,

253
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,360
 which is the atheist worldview.

254
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,540
 That is that you die, you go in the ground

255
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,180
 and worms eat you, you decay, and that's it.

256
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,420
 You cease to exist.

257
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,720
 There's annihilationism.

258
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,080
 This is kind of what they said, the Pope said.

259
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,040
 It's where you go to hell and then you essentially

260
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,620
 just burn off, you disappear.

261
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,060
 There's universalism, which it says that everyone

262
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,400
 will eventually go to heaven.

263
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,660
 Maybe you go to hell for a season,

264
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,120
 but you eventually go to heaven.

265
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,320
 There's reincarnation.

266
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,960
 If you're here and you are of the Hindu faith,

267
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,020
 you believe that you're going to die and then come back

268
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,240
 as either an animal, depending on how you lived,

269
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,240
 or as a person, or maybe even someone of nobility.

270
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,440
 There's the idea of the Catholic doctrine of purgatory,

271
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,780
 this middle ground, this place where you go

272
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,380
 until you are prayed out of it,

273
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,480
 this place between heaven and hell,

274
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,020
 or someone pays your way out of there, purgatory.

275
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,180
 And I can remember when young adults would say,

276
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,580
 "Hey, I don't want to worship God

277
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,860
 "because I don't want to worship anyone

278
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,360
 "who sends someone to hell."

279
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,860
 And I think the more common belief today is, who cares?

280
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,440
 It's apathy.

281
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,160
 Eminem said, "There's a place called heaven

282
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,240
 "and a place called hell, a place called prison

283
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,400
 "and a place called jail, and Daddy's on his way

284
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,480
 "to all three of them except one."

285
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,200
 And I think that's really our posturing

286
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,040
 as we talk about this place, hell.

287
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,040
 It's like, eh, maybe I'll go there, maybe I won't.

288
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,640
 That's because we don't know what it is.

289
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,920
 You would never have that posturing

290
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,080
 if you understood what it is.

291
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,480
 I'm gonna be in Luke chapter 16, if you turn there.

292
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,840
 I'm gonna start in verse 19 of Luke chapter 16,

293
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,160
 turn to the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke.

294
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,040
 Three books in.

295
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,880
 We're gonna look at three questions about hell

296
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,560
 from this story that Jesus tells.

297
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,040
 We're gonna look at what it is, who should be there,

298
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,420
 and what we do about it.

299
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,240
 Jesus, he's teaching the Pharisees.

300
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,800
 These are the religious people of the time.

301
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,080
 He's like, "Hey, let me tell you about a story

302
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,200
 "about one of my favorite topics.

303
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,680
 "We're gonna talk about hell."

304
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,040
 And so they're leaning in,

305
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,640
 and this is what he says in verse 19.

306
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,600
 There was a rich man who was dressed in purple

307
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,520
 and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.

308
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,240
 What he just did is he put the Pharisees in the story.

309
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,680
 These were the first, they were the originators

310
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,000
 of the prosperity gospel.

311
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,240
 They believed that if you were rich,

312
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,220
 you had a unique relationship with God,

313
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,400
 that God must love you, that's why you're wealthy.

314
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,580
 So this wealthy man who's dressed in purple,

315
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,560
 which was expensive clothes, okay,

316
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,400
 it's kinda like Prada, Gucci of the time, would be purple,

317
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,040
 and so that's what he's draped in,

318
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,440
 and he says he lives in a life of luxury every day.

319
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,720
 At his gate now, there's another man, he's a beggar,

320
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,480
 his name is Lazarus.

321
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,960
 He's covered in sores, and he's longing to eat

322
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,160
 what fell from this rich man's table,

323
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,000
 and even the dogs came and licked his sores.

324
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,360
 Lazarus, the name is literally the one whom God helped,

325
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,120
 the one whom God helped, and he's poor,

326
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,480
 and he's covered in sores, and he's hungry,

327
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,680
 and dogs come and lick his sores.

328
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,680
 So two men, the time came when the beggar died,

329
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,680
 Lazarus dies, and the angels came

330
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,080
 and carried him to Abraham's side.

331
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,520
 Okay, so Jesus is talking to Jews,

332
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,560
 and he wants to talk to them about heaven,

333
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,360
 so he talks to them about where Abraham,

334
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,640
 Father Abraham, all the Jews would have known Abraham,

335
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,200
 and he's like, hey, so now this man Lazarus

336
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,880
 is there with Abraham, Abraham's side.

337
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,100
 If you've studied theology,

338
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,240
 maybe you've heard it as Abraham's bosom.

339
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,040
 It's the waiting place, it's heaven,

340
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,280
 it's a place with God, a place of contentment,

341
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,200
 a place of great joy, where we await for Jesus

342
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,800
 to come back here, to make the new heavens

343
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,040
 and the new earth here.

344
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,960
 More about that next week.

345
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,540
 The rich man also died and was buried.

346
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,040
 In Hades, that's where he's at.

347
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,840
 In Hades, where he was in torment,

348
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,000
 you can underline torment,

349
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,360
 he looked up and saw Abraham far away,

350
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,680
 and Lazarus by his side.

351
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,200
 So he called to him, Father Abraham,

352
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,820
 have pity on me and send Lazarus

353
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,120
 to dip the tip of his finger in water

354
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,600
 and cool my tongue, because I am in agony,

355
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,080
 underline that word, agony in this fire.

356
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,640
 But Abraham replied, son, remember that in your lifetime

357
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,400
 you received your good things,

358
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,120
 while Lazarus received bad things,

359
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,760
 but now he is comforted here, and you are in agony.

360
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,860
 And besides all this, between us and you,

361
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,320
 a great chasm has been set in place

362
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,560
 so that those who want to go from here to you cannot,

363
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,760
 nor can anyone cross over from there to us.

364
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,880
 The rich man answered, then I beg you, Father,

365
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,420
 send Lazarus to my family, for I have five brothers,

366
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,760
 let him warn them so that they will not come

367
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,960
 to this place of torment.

368
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,000
 Abraham replied, they have Moses and the prophets,

369
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 let them listen to them.

370
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,480
 No, Father Abraham, he said, but if someone

371
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,520
 from the dead goes to them, they will repent.

372
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,800
 He said to them, Abraham says, if they do not listen

373
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,460
 to Moses and the prophets, they will not be convinced,

374
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,040
 even if someone rises from the dead.

375
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,360
 He says, hey, they have the Old Testament,

376
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,800
 they have the Torah, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,

377
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,800
 Numbers, Deuteronomy, let them read from the prophets.

378
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 They tell of where salvation can be found,

379
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,680
 and if they're not gonna listen to the Bible,

380
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,360
 they're not gonna listen, even if someone raises

381
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,220
 from the dead.

382
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,360
 And so you have two men here,

383
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,720
 two deaths, two destinations, Abraham's side,

384
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,260
 Hades, hell, Gehenna, the Valley of Hinnom,

385
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,880
 and we're talking about the afterlife.

386
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,560
 You have a place of comfort and a place of torment,

387
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,420
 a place of punishment, and a place of peace and goodness.

388
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,800
 We're gonna focus on the one of punishment this evening.

389
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
 The first question I wanna ask from this text

390
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,240
 is what is hell?

391
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,120
 What is hell?

392
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,640
 Let's talk about it, what it is.

393
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,640
 Well, let me start by saying what it's not.

394
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,840
 It's very simply, it's not anything remotely good.

395
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,520
 It is void of anything good, joyful, blissful,

396
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,600
 pleasant, peaceful, nice, kind, good, gentle,

397
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,600
 faithful, loving, anything that would cross over

398
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,320
 the positive line, it's not there.

399
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,920
 But Abraham replied, verse 25,

400
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,340
 "Son, remember in your life you received your good things.

401
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,060
 "You got 'em here on this earth,

402
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,820
 "so now you will have no good things.

403
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,240
 "While Lazarus received bad things,

404
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,920
 "but now he is comforted, and you are in agony."

405
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,920
 And so while anyone who's not trusted in Christ on earth,

406
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:58,040
 they still, even though they do not have God's Holy Spirit,

407
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,360
 still get to experience something called common grace.

408
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,380
 So there is no hell on earth.

409
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,520
 Let me explain what common grace is.

410
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,880
 There are things in this earth

411
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,840
 that are like commercials for God.

412
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,080
 It's things that make you laugh,

413
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,040
 things that give you a feeling of peace and contentment,

414
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,520
 things that allow you to feel satisfied,

415
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,280
 simple things like satisfying your hunger

416
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,840
 or quenching your thirst, watching a sunset,

417
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,560
 being generally protected.

418
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,680
 Okay, this is God's common grace to you.

419
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,240
 And they're commercials for God that shows you,

420
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,760
 hey, you're being watched over and protected,

421
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,480
 that there's a creator who's looking over you.

422
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,180
 There is none of those things in hell.

423
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:50,840
 There's nothing that remotely resembles that in hell.

424
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,380
 There's nothing to numb your pain in hell.

425
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,880
 So some of you think, yeah, you know,

426
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,000
 I'm gonna go to hell and party, drug, sex, and hip hop.

427
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,640
 No, it's no, no, no.

428
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,020
 None of those things exist in hell.

429
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,880
 And so if you're ever like, yeah, man, you know,

430
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,880
 someone's gonna die, hey, take a shot of Patron with Satan

431
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,760
 in my honor, what this text is telling you

432
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,760
 is there's nothing to even drink in hell.

433
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,360
 He's like, hey, Lazarus, go get me a drink.

434
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,960
 I'm in agony.

435
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,000
 Oh, no shots of Patron.

436
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,400
 There are none of your sinful pleasures in hell.

437
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,020
 There's nothing that would bring you any relief.

438
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,880
 There's no drugs there.

439
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,880
 It is a place void of God's blessing,

440
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,160
 void of joy, void of community, void of pleasure,

441
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,160
 void of good, and then here's the real kicker, forever.

442
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,480
 Forever.

443
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,760
 Forever.

444
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,860
 It never goes away.

445
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,840
 It's not punishment for a season and then cease.

446
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,000
 It's forever.

447
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 It's a place of torment and agony, verses 23, 24, and 25.

448
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,960
 Torment and agony.

449
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,040
 Jesus, when he'd talk about hell, he would use a metaphor.

450
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,200
 It was a literal place called Gehenna

451
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,800
 or the Valley of Hinnom.

452
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,400
 What it was was essentially the dump.

453
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,280
 It was a place outside the city where you would put garbage

454
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,600
 and dead people and dead animals.

455
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,200
 It stunk there.

456
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,880
 And not just that, but people would practice

457
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,920
 child sacrifice there by fire to the God of Molech.

458
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,240
 They would take their babies there and set them on fire

459
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,320
 as a sacrifice to the God of Molech.

460
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,720
 It was a dark place, a wicked place, a nasty place,

461
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,880
 a dirty place.

462
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,360
 There were worms there and maggots there

463
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,720
 and you couldn't even stand the smell there.

464
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,680
 And Jesus says, hey, that's the closest thing I got

465
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,280
 to explain to you what hell is like.

466
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,520
 Remember Gehenna, the Valley of Hinnom?

467
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,400
 Hell, it's worse than that.

468
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,400
 And so to this story, it takes place today

469
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,800
 before Jesus comes back.

470
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,600
 And in Revelation 20, Jesus talks about the lake of fire.

471
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,240
 And here's what I would tell you is what is coming

472
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,960
 is only worse than what is in this text.

473
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,880
 That what's coming is only worse.

474
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,000
 And so hell is wanting and never being satisfied

475
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,080
 for eternity.

476
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,920
 Hell is realizing the goodness that was available

477
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,960
 and your choice of evil.

478
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,320
 Don't you see what's going on?

479
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,480
 Is the rich man can see heaven.

480
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,960
 Like across this chasm, he sees Abraham

481
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,140
 and he sees Lazarus.

482
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,960
 Like the only thing worse than not getting into the party

483
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,960
 is sitting outside the party and watching everyone

484
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,160
 enjoy the fun that you could have had forever.

485
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,920
 You can see it.

486
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,380
 It's like eternal FOMO.

487
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,960
 You realize what you missed out on

488
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,040
 and it's right there in front of you.

489
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,240
 You know that it was available to you

490
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,240
 and they're having the most blissful, incredible time

491
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,720
 while you suffer forever.

492
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:19,140
 It's fixed and eternal.

493
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,400
 Hell is fixed and eternal.

494
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,860
 Verse 26, a great chasm.

495
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,100
 He says, "And besides all of this,

496
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,780
 "between us and you is a great chasm,

497
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,040
 "which has been fixed,

498
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,700
 "so that those who want to go from here to you cannot,

499
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,500
 "nor can anyone cross over from there to us."

500
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,380
 Can I just read to you one of the most horrific verses

501
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,860
 in all of the scripture?

502
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,260
 Second Thessalonians chapter one, verses eight and nine.

503
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,300
 He says this, listen.

504
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,380
 "He will punish those who do not know God

505
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,940
 "and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.

506
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,620
 "They will be punished with everlasting destruction

507
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,260
 "and shut out from the presence of the Lord

508
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,260
 "and from the glory of his might."

509
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,400
 See, it's fixed.

510
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,740
 You gotta hear me on this.

511
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,600
 This is the danger of universalism

512
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,220
 or the Unitarian movement

513
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,420
 that says that everyone eventually goes to heaven.

514
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,040
 It's a heresy, okay, that is not true,

515
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,380
 not supported by scriptures or anything that Jesus said.

516
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,660
 And we love it, we're really attracted to it.

517
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,780
 I wish it was true because, right,

518
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,700
 because then like we could do away with this idea of hell

519
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,620
 and it feels loving.

520
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,620
 It feels loving to tell someone that.

521
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,660
 I liken it to, if you,

522
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,140
 anyone traveled internationally?

523
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,540
 Okay, have you ever been in like a third world airport

524
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,260
 or somewhere where you don't know the way

525
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,460
 and no one speaks your language?

526
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,780
 And I can remember, like I can think back

527
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,580
 of when I was coming back from Rwanda

528
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,260
 and I'm in this airport and I have no idea where to go

529
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,180
 and I can't find the guys that I came with.

530
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,540
 And so if you're just kind of going from gate to gate

531
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,860
 and I'm like, okay, I can't even make sense of this.

532
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,620
 And imagine you see me and I miss my family.

533
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,140
 Like I wanna get home to my wife and my children.

534
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,860
 I've been gone for 10 days and I just wanna go see them.

535
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,900
 And I'm like, I don't know what to do.

536
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,500
 And you come up to me and you're like,

537
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,460
 JP, what are you doing?

538
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,540
 Hey man, what's wrong?

539
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,820
 You seem frazzled.

540
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,500
 And I say, I just wanna go home, man.

541
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,900
 I just wanna go home and I don't know which gate,

542
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
 which plane is gonna take me home.

543
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,640
 And you say, oh bro, I got you.

544
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,240
 Listen, just choose a plane you like.

545
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,280
 Any of these will take you home.

546
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,400
 Just choose the one that looks the best to you.

547
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,340
 And you'll get there.

548
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,040
 And just say in that hypothetical situation,

549
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,780
 I believed you.

550
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,380
 What's gonna happen is it's gonna feel so loving.

551
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,700
 Man, are you serious?

552
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,540
 Any of these?

553
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,380
 Yeah, any of them.

554
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,300
 Choose one you like.

555
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,480
 They all go to Dallas, Texas, DFW.

556
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,780
 Oh man, we're gonna hug.

557
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,180
 I'm gonna be like, thank you so much for loving me

558
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,180
 and showing me the way home.

559
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,340
 That's such great news 'cause I was scared.

560
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,780
 I was gonna choose the wrong one.

561
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,820
 And it's so great to know that any of them

562
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,640
 will get me home.

563
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,180
 Listen, I get on one of those planes

564
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,660
 and it takes me to North Korea or some place of unrest.

565
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,980
 And I get off and they throw me in a cell

566
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,500
 and then they beat me for the rest of my life.

567
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,340
 You know what, I'm not gonna think that was so loving.

568
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:34,500
 I'm gonna be like, man, why did you lead me astray?

569
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,820
 Why did you do that?

570
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,560
 Why did you tell me something that was uninformed

571
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,380
 just because it felt good?

572
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,740
 Just because it felt right?

573
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,780
 Hell is an awful place and any illustration

574
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,580
 I could give you would fall short of the horrors.

575
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,840
 And so how can a loving God send anyone there?

576
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,200
 It's the second question is who should be there?

577
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,120
 Who should be in hell?

578
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,480
 What is God's standard for heaven?

579
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,260
 God's standard is perfection.

580
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,100
 He's a holy God.

581
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,940
 And so who should be in hell?

582
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,900
 You ready for this answer?

583
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,760
 Everyone.

584
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:26,340
 Everyone has fallen short of God's glory.

585
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,160
 Everyone should be there.

586
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,140
 Everyone deserves hell.

587
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,540
 We've all worshiped ourselves in place

588
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,180
 of a holy and mighty God.

589
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,020
 None of us have met his standards.

590
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,940
 We've all fallen short of his standards.

591
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,180
 And so the second that he put us here on this earth,

592
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,280
 you can look backwards on your life.

593
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,180
 Who here is satisfied with the way they pursued God today?

594
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,820
 Did everyone have the quiet time they had hoped?

595
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,980
 Did everyone pray as much as they had hoped?

596
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,060
 Did everyone study the scriptures as much as you would like?

597
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,660
 Did anybody get jealous of anyone today?

598
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,380
 Okay, anybody envy anyone's situation today?

599
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,580
 Anyone think about themselves a lot?

600
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,740
 Right, what if anybody who's ever Googled

601
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,160
 their own name goes to hell?

602
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,300
 We're all good, right?

603
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,540
 Anybody who's ever counted their likes on Instagram,

604
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,540
 they go to hell.

605
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,860
 You good?

606
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,580
 You safe?

607
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,800
 Right, we all want to worship ourselves.

608
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,460
 We don't wanna worship God, we want to be God.

609
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,740
 None of it, I mean, who shared the gospel

610
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,740
 with everyone they met with today?

611
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,100
 Who lived out the beliefs that they say

612
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,780
 that they have today?

613
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,180
 Who gave all of their money to the poor today?

614
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,720
 Who lived like there's a real eternity of heaven

615
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,920
 and you're gonna be with God forever

616
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,740
 and that's what matters most today?

617
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,500
 We all deserve hell.

618
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:54,760
 We all fall short of what God has called us to.

619
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,580
 And the goal is not that you would leave here

620
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,580
 and just stop doing those things,

621
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:06,080
 but that you would begin to ask why.

622
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,880
 Why don't I live out what I say that I believe?

623
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,360
 And so who should be there?

624
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,760
 Those who cannot see the cross pass themselves.

625
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,600
 They should be there.

626
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,080
 Those who cannot see the cross pass themselves.

627
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,720
 Do you see the delusionment, the disillusionment rather,

628
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,840
 of this rich man?

629
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,280
 He's still giving orders.

630
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,960
 Lazarus, hey, give me a drink.

631
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,840
 I'm thirsty.

632
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,720
 It's like, dude, you're disillusioned.

633
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,520
 You're in hell.

634
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,280
 Lazarus, buddy, he's in heaven.

635
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,060
 He can't even get to you.

636
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,200
 And there's nothing to drink in hell.

637
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,040
 And this teaches us something really scary about sin

638
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,240
 that it carries us to a place of self-obsession

639
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,400
 so that we can't even see the gospel.

640
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,200
 Right?

641
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,040
 We can't even see the gospel.

642
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,200
 And what's dangerous about being where so many of us are,

643
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,880
 kind of what is left of the Bible belt

644
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,800
 is so many people here call themselves believers

645
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,520
 and say that they're Christians and followers of Jesus,

646
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,040
 but who really lives like they believe

647
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,240
 that this book is true?

648
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:16,220
 Who really dates, pursues purity, sobriety,

649
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,120
 Christ, evangelism, missions?

650
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,680
 Who really lives like this book is true,

651
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,640
 like your life is really, we sing those songs,

652
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,960
 "Hey, my life."

653
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,540
 But who does it?

654
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:36,640
 We've missed God because we tried to become God.

655
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,880
 See this rich man in the parable,

656
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,880
 he pursued his heaven here,

657
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,260
 and he used his resources to make himself more comfortable,

658
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,520
 and he overlooked the poor man at his gate.

659
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,360
 He said, "No, no."

660
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,520
 He saw the guy with the sign, and he said,

661
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,340
 "Oh, you want money?

662
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,420
 "It's my money, not your money.

663
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:01,440
 "I'm gonna do everything I can to dress a little better,

664
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,840
 "to drive something a little cooler,

665
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,400
 "to live in a better place.

666
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,440
 "I'm not sharing my stuff with anybody."

667
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,160
 He made his heaven here.

668
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,360
 He got caught up in the world.

669
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,760
 Says, "Son," verse 25,

670
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,440
 "remember that in your lifetime

671
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,840
 "you received your good things."

672
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,400
 And so what if today, porch, what if we left this place,

673
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,640
 and we began to live out what we say we believe?

674
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,040
 You guys, just you guys in the room,

675
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,520
 and you guys in Fort Worth,

676
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,980
 and you guys in Houston, El Paso, Tulsa,

677
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,300
 wherever you're at listening, you would change the world.

678
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,080
 You would start a revival.

679
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,920
 You would start a great awakening

680
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,420
 if you just began to live like you say you believe.

681
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,880
 But so many of us, we're running to hell

682
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,400
 as fast as we can, trying to build our heaven here,

683
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,000
 our own personal kingdom here.

684
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,520
 Matthew 10, verse 39 says,

685
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,540
 "Whoever finds their life will lose it,

686
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,280
 "and whoever loses their life for Jesus' sake will find it."

687
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,000
 Matthew 16, verse 24,

688
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,540
 "Then Jesus said to his disciples,

689
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,680
 "Whoever wants to be my disciple,"

690
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,620
 I wanna be your disciple, Jesus, I want, choose me, pick me,

691
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,260
 "must deny themselves and take up their cross

692
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,960
 "and follow me."

693
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,800
 But we're so stuck on ourselves.

694
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,860
 We can't see Christ.

695
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,640
 The rich man in the story

696
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,520
 never even realized his need for saving.

697
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,620
 He didn't want God,

698
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,700
 and so why would God allow him to go somewhere

699
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,440
 that the greatest thing about it is that God's there?

700
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,500
 Like if you don't like spending time with God here,

701
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,300
 why do you hope that you're gonna go somewhere

702
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,640
 and spend eternity with God?

703
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,160
 Well, how?

704
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,620
 He had his heaven here.

705
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,020
 This is why C.S. Lewis said

706
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,140
 that hell is locked from the inside,

707
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,620
 because we, like two-and-a-half-year-olds,

708
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:08,340
 are saying, "I can do whatever I want,"

709
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,180
 and we don't wanna submit to God,

710
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,820
 and God says, "Fine, fine, I love you,

711
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,140
 "I've pursued you, I've died for you.

712
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,580
 "Do whatever you want."

713
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:23,660
 There's those who say to God, "Thy will be done,"

714
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:27,020
 and those to whom God says,

715
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,780
 "No, thy will be done."

716
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,840
 If you don't want me,

717
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,100
 then go to a place where nothing there

718
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,100
 will remind you of me.

719
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:44,380
 In fact, the only thing of God in hell is his wrath.

720
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,140
 The only thing of God in hell

721
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,740
 is his anger towards your sin.

722
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,600
 You know the only thing you can do in hell?

723
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,780
 Pay for your sins.

724
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,560
 You know who doesn't go to hell?

725
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,460
 Those whose sins have been paid for.

726
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,020
 It is that simple.

727
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:13,480
 It's interesting that while we don't like

728
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,980
 the doctrine of hell,

729
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:20,720
 so many of us agree that someone should be there.

730
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,300
 Hitler, yeah, man, he should go to hell.

731
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,720
 Child rapists, yeah, they should go there.

732
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,200
 Murderers, serial killers, yeah, they should go.

733
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,280
 But when we draw the line,

734
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,360
 like where should the line stop?

735
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,120
 Right in front of me, that's where it should stop, right?

736
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,440
 Like somewhere over there, like pornographers,

737
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,560
 "Ah, I don't know about that."

738
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,680
 Those who have sex outside of marriage, "Ah, maybe not."

739
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,200
 Wherever, you wanna draw the line right in front of you.

740
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,920
 I haven't done something as bad as they have, right?

741
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,140
 And that's the way that we think about it.

742
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,020
 We want God to deal with evil.

743
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,260
 We just don't want him to deal with our evil.

744
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:10,260
 We want God to deal with wicked deeds, not just our deeds.

745
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,220
 Here's what you need to know.

746
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:16,560
 Every sin will be punished,

747
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,420
 either in eternity or on the cross.

748
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,820
 And you have a choice.

749
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,800
 God, in his great love and mercy towards you,

750
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,800
 has allowed you to choose where you want your sin paid for.

751
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,160
 You can pay for it in eternity,

752
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,160
 or you can acknowledge that it was paid for on the cross.

753
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,700
 And when you acknowledge that it was paid for on the cross,

754
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,760
 you get to be with God forever in his kingdom.

755
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,600
 You become the sons and the daughters of God.

756
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,760
 This is what we just looked at at Easter.

757
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,620
 The cross of Easter, the empty tomb, that happened for you.

758
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,460
 Why?

759
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,740
 This is the craziest narrative in the world,

760
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,140
 that God would allow his son to die.

761
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,100
 A God who controls everything would allow his son

762
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,060
 to be brutally murdered and tortured

763
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,560
 outside of a city to death.

764
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,640
 And he did it for you.

765
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:17,380
 Christ paying for your sins.

766
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,620
 Because none of us are good.

767
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:24,260
 You cannot be good enough to get to heaven.

768
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,900
 The scripture says, Mark 10, verse 18,

769
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,200
 Jesus answered, "No one is good except God alone."

770
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,100
 Romans 3, verses 10 and 12,

771
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,260
 "As it is written, there is no one righteous, not even one.

772
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,780
 "There is no one who understands.

773
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,120
 "There is no one who seeks God.

774
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,300
 "All have turned away.

775
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,020
 "They have together become worthless.

776
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,740
 "There is no one who does good, not even one."

777
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,160
 And so who can get to heaven?

778
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:49,140
 Not those who are good, but those who have been forgiven.

779
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,620
 Those who have been forgiven.

780
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,980
 He answered, the rich man answered,

781
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,220
 "I beg you, Father, send Lazarus to my family,

782
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,340
 "for I have five brothers.

783
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,680
 "Let him warn them so that they will not come

784
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,600
 "to this terrible, terrible place."

785
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,320
 Abraham replied, "They have Moses and the prophets.

786
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,780
 "Let them listen to them.

787
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,160
 "Let them read their Bibles and trust their Bibles."

788
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,460
 "No, Father Abraham," he said,

789
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,580
 "but if someone from the dead goes to them,

790
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,660
 "they will repent."

791
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,260
 And he said to them, "If they don't listen

792
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,120
 "to Moses and the prophets, they will not be convinced,

793
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,880
 "even if someone rises from the dead."

794
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,800
 Do you guys remember Jesus?

795
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,700
 Jesus raised someone from the dead.

796
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,180
 Do you remember that?

797
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,000
 You guys remember that?

798
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,840
 Anybody remember?

799
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,020
 You grew up in Sunday school or something?

800
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,540
 Remember Jesus raised somebody from the dead?

801
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,640
 Come forth, it's John chapter 11.

802
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,940
 What was that guy's name?

803
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,600
 Oh, wow, it was Lazarus, wasn't it?

804
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,680
 It's like Jesus leaves this story and says,

805
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,040
 "Okay, we'll test your theory."

806
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,040
 And he raises a Lazarus from the dead.

807
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
 And you know what happened?

808
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,580
 Some people believed, but not the Pharisees.

809
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:02,200
 In fact, they wanted to kill Lazarus.

810
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,840
 It's John chapter 12, verses 10, 11.

811
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,780
 So the chief priest made plans to kill Lazarus as well,

812
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,540
 for on account of him, many of the Jews

813
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,880
 were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him.

814
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,520
 And so it's so interesting that some people

815
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,780
 see a dead man walking and they say,

816
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,480
 "Man, that guy, he's gotta be God's son."

817
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,720
 And others see a dead man walking,

818
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,620
 they say, "Hey, let's kill him again.

819
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,540
 (congregation laughing)

820
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,960
 "We're not gonna follow this Jesus character."

821
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,320
 And it's also in this text,

822
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,380
 a foreshadowing of Jesus coming back to life.

823
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,120
 Like if you're here and you're like,

824
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,180
 "Man, if God raised someone from the dead,

825
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,020
 "I'd worship him."

826
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,880
 Would you look to Sunday?

827
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,320
 'Cause he did.

828
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,300
 And you shouldn't even know who Jesus is.

829
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,380
 But he did a pretty amazing thing

830
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,160
 coming out of that grave and became world famous.

831
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,980
 And so those who deny the message of the one

832
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,680
 who came back from the dead will be there.

833
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,140
 Those who deny the message of the one

834
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,900
 who came back from the dead will be there.

835
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,600
 'Cause as I said, every sin is paid for

836
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,260
 either in hell or on the cross.

837
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,100
 You can send that out to your friends, right?

838
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,940
 Tell people that every sin is paid for

839
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,780
 either in hell or on the cross.

840
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,140
 The only thing you do in hell is pay for sins.

841
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,700
 And so what about those who've never heard?

842
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,360
 What about you?

843
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,840
 What about babies?

844
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,680
 What about you?

845
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,180
 I was sharing the gospel with a guy

846
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,100
 and he said, "Man, I don't believe in God."

847
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,460
 I said, "Why not?"

848
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,660
 He said, "Because not everybody's heard the gospel."

849
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,980
 I just, I can't get my head around that.

850
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,140
 Like not everyone's heard the gospel

851
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,920
 and so I just, I reject God.

852
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,780
 Like if he's gonna send people to hell

853
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,420
 that have never heard who he is

854
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,700
 and I'm just like, "What about you?

855
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,940
 "Have you heard the gospel?"

856
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,740
 You, like think about your argument, it breaks down.

857
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,060
 Are you gonna say, "You know what, man?

858
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,940
 "I'm no longer gonna take a paycheck

859
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,020
 "because not everybody gets a paycheck.

860
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,840
 "So I'm just gonna stop taking one.

861
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,600
 "You know what, I'm gonna live on the streets

862
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,120
 "because not everyone has a house.

863
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,820
 "So I'm gonna live on the streets."

864
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,260
 That's crazy.

865
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,160
 That is a ludicrous idea.

866
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
 And they always say, "Well, what about, you know,

867
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,640
 "the Bush man in Africa?

868
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,880
 "What about the tribal warrior in the Amazon?"

869
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,840
 To which I said, "You know what, man?

870
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,360
 "I was in Africa.

871
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,280
 "I was in the Bush and I met a person

872
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,400
 "who trusted Christ in their dream, bro.

873
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,580
 "In their dream.

874
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,840
 "Like God showed up in their dream

875
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,980
 "and shared the gospel with them.

876
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,480
 "And I've been on the Amazon.

877
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,520
 "I've been in the Amazon jungle.

878
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,200
 "I went down the Amazon River for six days,

879
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,620
 "got off in a village where they told me,

880
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,380
 "Hey, these people have never heard about Jesus.

881
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,540
 "I was so excited.

882
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,740
 "I set foot off the boat.

883
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,580
 "Hey, how are you doing?

884
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,420
 "Have you heard of Jesus?"

885
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,720
 And they pointed to a church they had just built.

886
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,720
 And they say, "Yeah.

887
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,640
 "Yeah, we know Jesus.

888
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,400
 "We just heard about him.

889
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,080
 "We built that church to worship him."

890
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,640
 And so you wanna talk about the person,

891
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,200
 I don't know about the person who has never heard,

892
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,000
 but what about the one who has?

893
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,440
 You're gonna get up there and say,

894
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,940
 "Hey God, the reason I rejected you

895
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,600
 "is 'cause some other people hadn't heard about you."

896
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,380
 Man, don't do that.

897
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,540
 Don't do that.

898
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,640
 This guy goes on to say,

899
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,480
 "Here's what I'd encourage you to do, buddy.

900
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,240
 "I'd encourage you to think about Jesus.

901
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,320
 "Like Jesus lived.

902
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,820
 "I believe that there was a man named Jesus,

903
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,840
 "but he was just a man."

904
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,680
 I said, "Really?

905
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,000
 "Like Jesus Christ, he was just a man?"

906
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,600
 "Yeah, Jesus Christ was just a man.

907
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,440
 "Born in Bethlehem?

908
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,260
 "Yeah, born in Bethlehem.

909
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,100
 "Lived in Nazareth?

910
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,600
 "Yeah, that Jesus, just a man."

911
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,320
 Say, "How do you know about Jesus?

912
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,160
 "How do you even know who he is?"

913
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,080
 He said, "Well, everyone knows about Jesus."

914
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,880
 I said, "You just said they didn't."

915
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,520
 (congregation laughing)

916
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,640
 I said, "How do you know about Jesus?"

917
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,480
 He said, "Well, you know.

918
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,800
 "I mean, it's written."

919
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,640
 "Wait, where?

920
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,460
 "Where is it written?"

921
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,300
 "In the Bible."

922
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,120
 I said, "Okay, hold on.

923
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,340
 "What does the Bible say about Jesus?

924
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,580
 "Like why would you embrace the book

925
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,240
 "that says there was a Jesus

926
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,700
 "and yet reject who the book says he was?

927
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,720
 "How can you do that?

928
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,080
 "You're gonna hold fast to some ideas,

929
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,920
 "but reject others?

930
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,060
 "You get to choose what's true and what's not.

931
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,900
 "Is that it?

932
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,760
 "Like you're gonna take this

933
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,140
 "and just kinda cut it apart

934
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,720
 "and choose the verses you like

935
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,680
 "and get rid of the ones you don't?

936
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,560
 "How can you do that?"

937
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,400
 And you say, "Okay, JP,

938
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,240
 "the hell is so horrific.

939
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,040
 "How can God send anyone there?"

940
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,280
 It's the wrong question.

941
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,920
 How can a perfect, loving, good God

942
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,480
 allow any sinful person in his presence?

943
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,360
 How?

944
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,160
 How can a holy, righteous, perfect God

945
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,180
 allow anyone who's ever masturbated

946
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,900
 or been drunk or looked at pornography

947
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,540
 or had sex outside of marriage

948
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:43,100
 or cursed or stole or lied or cheated,

949
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,380
 how can that God allow any of those people

950
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,820
 in his presence

951
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,680
 that we've been running from him

952
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,460
 since we showed up on the scene?

953
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,260
 And God, I mean, we've been running toward hell

954
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,100
 since we showed up on the scene

955
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,040
 and God in his mercy has changed some of our hearts.

956
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,900
 And you say, "Well, what about me?

957
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,420
 "How do I know if he's changed my heart?"

958
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,780
 Friend, would you consider where you are

959
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,800
 on a Tuesday night?

960
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,840
 You are, here's a reality check for you, bro.

961
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,980
 God loves you so much

962
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,900
 that he had you come on hell day.

963
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,020
 (congregation laughing)

964
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,780
 You could've came on like

965
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:22,480
 justification day, but you came on hell day.

966
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,260
 That's how much God loves you.

967
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:29,740
 That in his sovereignty, he has you here.

968
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,540
 He's provided a means for forgiveness.

969
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,580
 He's provided a way for everyone to get to him.

970
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,100
 He's a loving God.

971
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,500
 And it's through Jesus.

972
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,100
 I was talking to a young lady yesterday

973
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,640
 and I just asked her, "Did you celebrate Easter?"

974
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,480
 She said, "Yeah."

975
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,300
 I said, "What did you do?"

976
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,220
 She said, "It was with my family."

977
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,820
 It was a person I had just met at the gym.

978
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,540
 And she said, "Yeah, I was with my family.

979
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,620
 "Went to church and whatnot."

980
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,380
 And I said, "So you have faith?"

981
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,220
 She said, "Oh, yeah."

982
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,860
 I said, "Let me ask you two questions."

983
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,700
 She said, "Sure."

984
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,900
 I said, "Between one and 10, 10 being certain,

985
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,260
 "one being not so sure, if you died today,

986
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,860
 "how certain are you that you'd go to heaven?"

987
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,940
 She said, "Oh, I'm a 10."

988
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,020
 I said, "Great, second question."

989
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,420
 God says, "Why should I let you in?

990
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,860
 "What would you say?"

991
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,620
 She said, "Because I love everyone.

992
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:22,220
 "I'm really loving, I love people."

993
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,060
 And I said, "Do you think everyone

994
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,940
 "who loves people goes to heaven?"

995
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,780
 She said, "I think that's really foundational

996
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,500
 "to getting there."

997
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,420
 And I said, "You said you celebrated Easter yesterday.

998
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,100
 "This was yesterday, so Easter was the day before."

999
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,940
 And she said, "Yeah, I celebrated Easter."

1000
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,020
 I said, "What happened on Easter?"

1001
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,580
 She said, "Jesus died for our sins, raised from the dead."

1002
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,240
 I said, "Why not that as your answer,

1003
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,020
 "that God paid for your sins?"

1004
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,600
 She said, "Well, it just feels so exclusive."

1005
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,260
 Friends, you don't get to choose.

1006
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:51,140
 Like, if heaven is God's place,

1007
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,940
 he gets to choose how you get there.

1008
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:57,480
 And you don't get there by rejecting his pathway.

1009
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,000
 That's foolish.

1010
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,680
 That's really closed-minded of you.

1011
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,640
 I would let the one who created heaven

1012
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,960
 tell you how to get there.

1013
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,500
 I would let the one who came from heaven

1014
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,360
 show you the way to get there.

1015
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,820
 And it's just like, you gotta trust.

1016
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,020
 She's like, "Well, God is love.

1017
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,400
 "How do you know God is love?

1018
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,820
 "Where did you learn that God is love?

1019
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,200
 "Where does it say that God is love?"

1020
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,720
 Well, the Bible says that God is love.

1021
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,080
 What else does the Bible say?

1022
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,120
 It also says that he's the way, the truth, and the life,

1023
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,840
 and no one gets to the Father except through him.

1024
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,680
 Right, it says this idea that there's a hell,

1025
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,960
 and you get there by telling people

1026
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,080
 that the way they get to heaven is by being loving.

1027
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,120
 Like, how can you choose what you believe

1028
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,600
 that's in the Bible?

1029
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,440
 You, like, if the Bible said,

1030
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,560
 "Hey, the way you get to heaven

1031
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,360
 "is do 1,000 pushups every day,"

1032
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,120
 then I would be completely ripped.

1033
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,160
 (congregation laughing)

1034
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,360
 But that's not what it says.

1035
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,660
 It says the way you get to heaven

1036
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,120
 is by believing that Jesus Christ died for your sins,

1037
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,340
 and God raised him from the dead.

1038
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:10,440
 See, God is just, and he will not compromise his character.

1039
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,560
 And justice requires a consequence,

1040
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,180
 or a payment for sin, a sentence.

1041
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,400
 But God is loving, and he paid the consequence

1042
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,000
 through Jesus Christ.

1043
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 And so he is best for us,

1044
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,760
 and he will use anything to draw us to him,

1045
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,880
 including an ultimatum.

1046
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,240
 And you say, "Well, if God's gonna give me an ultimatum,

1047
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,480
 "man, screw it, I ain't going there.

1048
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,200
 "No, I'm not worshiping him."

1049
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,560
 And buddy, you don't win.

1050
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,260
 That's not wise.

1051
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,160
 I would not bow up to the creator of the universe.

1052
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,620
 You don't get to choose.

1053
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,300
 You don't get to choose.

1054
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,760
 And I think often we think that God hates

1055
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,640
 those that go to hell.

1056
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,100
 I love that Abraham calls the man in hell son.

1057
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,800
 And this man, this rich man,

1058
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,140
 his thirst will never be quenched.

1059
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,800
 But Jesus says, in John 6, 35,

1060
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,800
 Jesus declared, "He who believes in me

1061
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,600
 "will never be thirsty."

1062
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,120
 I want you to know Jesus injured hell

1063
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,440
 so that you don't have to.

1064
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,780
 Talked to another young lady who,

1065
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,920
 I said, "Do you believe in heaven?"

1066
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,760
 And she said, "No."

1067
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,600
 I said, "Do you believe in hell?"

1068
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,420
 She said, "Yeah."

1069
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,680
 I said, "How do you believe in hell and not heaven?"

1070
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,000
 She said, "Oh, I'm going to hell."

1071
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,920
 I said, "Why would you say that you're going to hell?"

1072
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,240
 She said, "Man, I've just done some things.

1073
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,280
 "Done some really terrible things."

1074
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,100
 I said, "Have you heard of Jesus?

1075
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,440
 "Do you think Jesus, creator God,

1076
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,640
 "is big enough to pay for the terrible things you did?"

1077
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,840
 See, and I shared the gospel.

1078
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,880
 I said, "That's what happened on the cross at Calvary,

1079
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,800
 "is Christ paid for your sins,

1080
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,280
 "and God raised him from the dead."

1081
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,960
 She said, "You mean that Jesus Christ paid for my sins

1082
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,440
 "so that I don't have to?"

1083
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,280
 I said, "Yeah."

1084
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,280
 She said, "Wow, that's great news."

1085
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,640
 And I said, "You get it, you got it."

1086
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,040
 (congregation laughing)

1087
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,800
 Praise God, it's great news.

1088
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,280
 And so how should we respond?

1089
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,900
 If this is hell, how should we respond?

1090
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,800
 Listen, some of you need to hear this first part.

1091
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,960
 How should you respond?

1092
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,380
 This is what you need to hear tonight.

1093
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,560
 This is the only thing you need to hear tonight.

1094
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,520
 You trust in the one who is pointing you to life.

1095
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,920
 You will not be able to endure this life correctly,

1096
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,240
 and you will not make it to eternal life with him

1097
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,880
 without trusting in God's provision,

1098
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,200
 his allotment in Jesus Christ, his son.

1099
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,540
 2018 years ago, he came to the earth and reset the time.

1100
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,760
 God is after you, you're here.

1101
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,000
 He doesn't want you to go to hell.

1102
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,760
 He is trying to communicate that to you right now.

1103
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,960
 He loves you.

1104
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,440
 In the morning time, he turns on the light for you.

1105
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,000
 He's given you songs, a soundtrack played through birds

1106
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,200
 and creation.

1107
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,040
 He's given you the seasons.

1108
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,120
 He grows flowers for you in the springtime.

1109
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,640
 He brings you flowers.

1110
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,300
 He's crazy about you.

1111
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,940
 And right here in this text, you have a message from hell.

1112
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,920
 It's a guy saying, "Hey, go tell them

1113
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,520
 "that they don't want to be here."

1114
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,180
 He said, "If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets,

1115
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,340
 "they will not be convinced,

1116
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:19,840
 "even if someone raises from the dead."

1117
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,000
 And I'm telling you, someone did raise from the dead,

1118
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,480
 and that is your way to get to eternal life.

1119
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,560
 If you go back to that airport illustration,

1120
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,360
 I'm there, you come up to me, you say,

1121
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,200
 "Hey, choose the plane that you like the most.

1122
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,360
 "It's gonna get you to home."

1123
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,780
 But then my other friend comes up and he says,

1124
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,780
 "No, JP, not all of these planes, that's crazy.

1125
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,580
 "Not all of these planes are gonna take you home.

1126
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,420
 "It's D7.

1127
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,980
 "You want gate D7.

1128
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:46,440
 "That's what's going to take you to Dallas."

1129
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,600
 And that other person says,

1130
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,980
 "You're telling me just one plane?

1131
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,980
 "That's so close-minded.

1132
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,540
 "Why would you say such a thing?

1133
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,240
 "That's unloving."

1134
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,700
 And here's the deal.

1135
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,240
 The person who is saying D7 can say it

1136
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,880
 with the confidence of knowing

1137
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,320
 that I'm going to learn the truth.

1138
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,320
 You get to share the gospel with somebody.

1139
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,320
 Hey, you can choose Jesus Christ,

1140
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,740
 believing that he died for your sins,

1141
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,200
 and God raised him from the dead.

1142
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,560
 And if you do not choose that, you will go to hell.

1143
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,960
 And I don't want you to go to hell,

1144
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,120
 so I want you to choose Jesus.

1145
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,240
 And when you share that,

1146
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,720
 you know that that person is going to learn the truth.

1147
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,040
 Every knee will bow and every tongue will confess,

1148
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,500
 and they will say, "Wow, thank you so much

1149
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,300
 "for loving me enough to show me

1150
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,220
 "that D7 is the only plane that's gonna take me home."

1151
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,400
 Or they're gonna say,

1152
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,640
 "Man, I wish I would have listened to you."

1153
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,300
 But you get to share from the confidence

1154
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,480
 of knowing that they will know the truth.

1155
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,840
 And God tells us the truth,

1156
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,260
 but we want freedom like Presley.

1157
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,480
 And so what do we do?

1158
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,480
 We serve others.

1159
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,120
 That's what you spend your life serving others.

1160
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,000
 Like the rich man should have served Lazarus,

1161
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,340
 not to be saved, but as evidence that you are saved,

1162
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,680
 so that they might become saved.

1163
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,560
 And the rich man was here with excess

1164
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,680
 when Lazarus had need and he ignored him.

1165
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,480
 And so you don't love others so that you don't go to hell.

1166
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,700
 You love others so that they don't go to hell.

1167
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,900
 You point them to the way.

1168
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:12,760
 What else do you do?

1169
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,420
 You share with everyone.

1170
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,700
 You share with everyone with the confidence

1171
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,340
 that they are going to know the truth,

1172
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:23,140
 that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life.

1173
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,300
 And no one gets to heaven except by entering

1174
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,420
 through the narrow gate that is Jesus Christ,

1175
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:33,420
 believing that he paid for your sins

1176
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,100
 so that you don't have to.

1177
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,660
 It's the great exchange.

1178
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,500
 Jesus got what you deserve,

1179
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,480
 and if you believe that he got what you deserve

1180
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,780
 on the cross, then you get what he deserves.

1181
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,140
 You become a son and a daughter to God,

1182
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,900
 the creator of the heavens and the earth.

1183
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,400
 You gain an eternal inheritance.

1184
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,760
 You get to be with God forever.

1185
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,500
 And so in summary, hell is not a place we wanna be.

1186
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,100
 And everyone deserves to be there,

1187
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,080
 but those who have trusted in God's provision

1188
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,380
 through Jesus become sons and daughters of God.

1189
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,220
 They get what Jesus deserves,

1190
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,860
 trusting that Jesus got what they deserve.

1191
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,940
 And thirdly, we respond to hell by trusting in God's word,

1192
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,900
 serving others with our resources,

1193
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,020
 and telling everyone we can the good news

1194
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,980
 that Jesus Christ died in our place

1195
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,460
 so that they can be with him,

1196
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,580
 so that we can be with him forever.

1197
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:31,420
 What I did with my daughter when she said that

1198
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:37,180
 is she said, "I can do whatever I want."

1199
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,900
 And I said, "Really?"

1200
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,860
 I just grabbed the trash can and said,

1201
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:45,960
 "Hey, I just want you to look at that, okay?

1202
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,960
 "I'll be right back."

1203
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,340
 I think she thought I was gonna throw her away,

1204
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,500
 which I wouldn't do, but.

1205
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,620
 (congregation laughing)

1206
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,420
 I went and I got some things and I came back,

1207
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:01,380
 said, "I got this for you today, but you lost it forever."

1208
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:05,080
 And she looked at me and she goes,

1209
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,320
 (growling)

1210
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:12,220
 "I can do whatever I want!"

1211
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,140
 I said, "I was afraid you were gonna say that.

1212
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,340
 (congregation laughing)

1213
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,100
 "See, I'm your daddy, I love you, I'm crazy about you.

1214
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,900
 "Man, I've got good things that you don't even know exist.

1215
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,860
 "And this is the good stuff.

1216
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,880
 "These are C's lollipops.

1217
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,100
 "I've had 'em in the utility room.

1218
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,840
 "I was gonna give 'em to you at just the right time.

1219
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:34,240
 "This is the good stuff, but you lost that forever."

1220
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,080
 Forever.

1221
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:39,280
 And she didn't say anything.

1222
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,420
 It began to click.

1223
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:47,540
 That her daddy loves her and has good things for her,

1224
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:51,220
 and her choices are only costing her,

1225
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:55,020
 her daddy's goodness, her daddy's grace,

1226
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,260
 and her daddy's provision.

1227
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,180
 Her daddy does not desire to rip her off,

1228
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:02,380
 but to set her free, to show her life.

1229
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,820
 She thinks at two and a half

1230
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,740
 that she knows better than her daddy.

1231
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:09,420
 And she doesn't, and it's foolish,

1232
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:12,140
 and it's just as foolish when you do it.

1233
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:15,520
 And so she lost out on the goodness

1234
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,520
 that I had for her forever.

1235
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:23,900
 But here's the deal.

1236
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,540
 I'm crazy about my daughter, man.

1237
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:28,820
 And I love to give her good things.

1238
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,100
 This thing comes in its own carrying case.

1239
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,440
 (congregation laughing)

1240
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:39,780
 This is a replica of the first one that I gave to her,

1241
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,280
 because I love her, not on that day.

1242
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,820
 I saved it for just the right time.

1243
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,780
 Said, "Hey, I know you love lollipops,

1244
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:50,820
 "and I love to give you good things,

1245
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,980
 "so I thought we could share this one together."

1246
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,500
 And if you think her eyes were big

1247
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,820
 when I pulled out that Tootsie Pot,

1248
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,060
 she was going crazy.

1249
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:03,180
 And I say that because God has good things for you,

1250
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,980
 better than you could ever imagine.

1251
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,380
 And you're missing out on them

1252
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,500
 by choosing the way that seems right to you,

1253
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,100
 but in the end leads to death.

1254
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,540
 Will you please stop?

1255
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:17,020
 Well, right now, as we sing this last song,

1256
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:20,460
 would you just say, "God, all my life,

1257
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,400
 "I've laid it down.

1258
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:28,160
 "I wanna be defined by Christ

1259
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,280
 "who was crucified for me.

1260
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,720
 "The life that I live in the body,

1261
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:38,440
 "I live by Christ, His power, His spirit."

1262
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,320
 Your response to this,

1263
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,040
 everyone, believer and non-believer alike,

1264
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,400
 your response is surrender.

1265
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,520
 Lord, this is my life.

1266
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,440
 I want you to take it.

1267
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,940
 So let me pray that you would.

1268
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,880
 Father, I thank you that you're a God of grace.

1269
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,760
 You're a God of good things.

1270
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,880
 And you don't desire, you tell us in the scripture

1271
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,840
 that you do not delight in sending anyone to hell.

1272
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:10,080
 And that you're not slow in keeping your promises,

1273
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,460
 as some understand slowness,

1274
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,320
 but you're patient with us,

1275
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,880
 not wanting anyone to perish,

1276
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,000
 but everyone to come to repentance.

1277
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,520
 Father, tonight, I pray there's a wave

1278
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,480
 through Dallas, Texas, and Houston, Texas,

1279
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,960
 and Tulsa, Oklahoma, and El Paso, Texas,

1280
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,120
 and Fort Worth, Texas, and all over the world,

1281
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,880
 a wave of young adults saying,

1282
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,720
 "Lord, here I am.

1283
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,420
 "I surrender my life to you.

1284
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,260
 "I surrender my will to you.

1285
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,500
 "I don't wanna be like the rich man

1286
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,760
 "who enjoyed his pleasures on earth,

1287
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,760
 "but missed out on them in eternity.

1288
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,580
 "I wanna be like the beggar Lazarus.

1289
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,500
 "Lord, make us like the beggar Lazarus,

1290
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,600
 "begging for bread from your table

1291
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:59,020
 "so that we might dine with you for eternity.

1292
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:02,340
 "Lord, would you take our lives?

1293
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:05,000
 "We love you, and we thank you for this text.

1294
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,600
 "We thank you for your son who spoke these words.

1295
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,540
 "It's in his name, Jesus' name, amen."

1296
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:21,540
