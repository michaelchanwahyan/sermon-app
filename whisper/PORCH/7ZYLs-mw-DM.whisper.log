[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:19.520]   - All right, Porsche, how we doing?
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.840]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.680]   Good.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.520]   We are wrapping up our series tonight,
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.720]   There He Said It.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.240]   And before we do that, I wanna welcome
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.880]   one specific Porche Live location.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.440]   It is a significant night for them.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.080]   And it's actually a historic moment
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.160]   because these guys are about to break off
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.960]   and be their own young adult ministry and serve their city.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.760]   And they were actually the first
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.420]   Porche Live location to ever exist.
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.080]   So this is a really big deal.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.800]   And we could not be more excited for these people.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.880]   We believe in their team, in their staff, in their city.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.060]   And we are so excited to welcome and say thank you
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.360]   and send off in an honoring way, a strong way,
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.520]   give it up for the Porche Live Fort Worth
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.600]   for tuning in tonight.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.320]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.560]   We love you guys.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.000]   We're praying for you guys.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.540]   And we are so excited to see the way
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.920]   that you impact the young adults
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.600]   all across Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.680]   And of course, my friends tonight in Dallas, welcome.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.520]   Last week, David, he talked about
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.380]   the shocking statement from Jesus,
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.120]   which was ask and you shall receive.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.340]   It was just this really great reminder
[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.360]   that God wants his children to come and ask and seek
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.200]   and knock and be persistent
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.000]   because he loves to give good things to his children.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.200]   And tonight we're taking like a pretty big turn
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.320]   because that was in Matthew chapter six.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.800]   Jesus is teaching his first sermon
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.900]   called the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.400]   And this text is in Matthew chapter seven
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.040]   where Jesus is wrapping up that sermon.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.340]   And he just kind of really takes a big turn
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.080]   that is kind of a downer.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.420]   And this passage, I mean, shocking is an understatement.
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.180]   This passage actually haunted me for majority of my life.
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.460]   I used to read this text alone in my room
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.240]   and not know what to think.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.620]   And it's a really, really important statement
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.660]   that we need to take heed to.
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.940]   And Jesus, he takes this statement serious
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.460]   because he's serious about us.
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.020]   He's serious about us being with him.
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.280]   And so let's read Matthew chapter seven, verse 21.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.780]   Jesus says, "Not everyone who says to me,
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.540]   'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.980]   But the one who does the will of my father
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.780]   who is in heaven,
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.740]   on that day, many will say to me,"
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.740]   he's talking about the day where he returns as king
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.140]   and comes and takes those who are his into heaven.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.900]   He says, "On that day, many will say to me,
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.260]   'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.500]   and cast out demons in your name
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.000]   and do many mighty works in your name?'
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.680]   Depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'"
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.240]   Tonight's shocking statement from Jesus
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.360]   is "Depart from me, I never knew you."
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.640]   But before we talk about that, I wanna pray for us.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.640]   God, I ask that you would come
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.320]   and do what only you can do.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.360]   Holy Spirit, would you come right now
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.060]   and perform the miraculous?
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.340]   Would you take our superficial thoughts,
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.500]   our superficial circumstances,
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.160]   our superficial ideologies,
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.720]   and would you transform them
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.000]   into a supernatural awakening of the love of Jesus
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.440]   that he has for every single person in this room?
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.960]   I pray that there is someone here tonight
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.560]   that when they read this passage,
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.400]   and the first thing that comes to their mind
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.960]   is fear and worry and anxiety, questioning,
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.640]   "Is that gonna be me?
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.160]   Is Jesus gonna let me into heaven?"
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.680]   I pray right now you would just bring them a sense of peace,
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.480]   an ability to listen and understand your heart.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.900]   I pray that this is not a message that sends condemnation,
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.300]   but shows your divine character for us,
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.660]   the people that you radically love,
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.120]   that you would do anything for to be with forever.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.180]   It's your holy name that we pray, amen.
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.680]   I remember in college,
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.760]   I was hanging out with my friends one night,
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.640]   it was Halloween weekend,
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.600]   and everyone knew at SFA, Lumberjacks, Axe & Jax,
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.920]   we got two, three, what?
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.300]   Yeah, three of you.
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.440]   In Nacogdoches, Texas,
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.500]   you knew that there was one place you wanted to be
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.760]   on Halloween weekend,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.320]   and it was the ATO party.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.560]   Everyone else knew that but me,
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.040]   'cause I wasn't really a fraternity guy,
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.520]   I know that you can probably tell,
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.640]   but my roommate was,
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.000]   he was like the poster of fraternity guys,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.960]   he was actually the president of ATO.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.800]   And so he was over this whole party,
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.080]   and he goes and is like spending all day planning for it,
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.640]   they have this house kind of off campus with this backyard,
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.600]   with this like private fence set up,
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.760]   and it just floods with college students,
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.320]   and it's just the place to be.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.200]   Anyone who's anyone's gonna be there,
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.240]   you gotta be there except for me and my friends.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.240]   And so we're at home, and we're chilling,
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.680]   and I'm like, yeah, who needs fraternities?
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.120]   And my friend's like, I kind of would go,
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.920]   I wish I was there.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.720]   And I was like, oh, yeah, I mean, it kind of sounds cool,
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.600]   it's better than Nintendo 64,
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.000]   you know, like, I mean, we could go and like hang out,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.720]   and he's like, yeah, but we don't have any tickets,
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.420]   like if only we had tickets.
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.600]   And in that moment, I was like, I know the president,
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.480]   like he's my homie, he's my roommate,
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.840]   I know Connor.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.440]   And so I'm like, I got us, let's go.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.460]   And so we kind of get Halloween costumed up,
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.480]   and we head over to the ATO house.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.000]   I mean, the cars are just parked miles down the road.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.040]   We're walking, you can hear the bump of the music
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.820]   in the distance, we're getting excited.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.760]   My guys are getting anticipated, this is awesome,
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.000]   this is such an amazing, we're about to be
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.200]   such an amazing night, we're getting so excited.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.360]   And we're pulling up, and right when we're walking up,
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.560]   there's two guys, they were definitely pledges.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.560]   They cover the entrance, and they're like, ticket.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.800]   And I'm like, ticket, what do you think I am, a peasant?
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.520]   And I'm like, actually, I got the VIP,
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.880]   I know the president, I know Connor Negley.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.200]   And he's like, man, do you know how many people
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.680]   know Connor Negley, we need your ticket.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.000]   And I'm looking at my guys, and I'm like,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.080]   don't worry, guys.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.440]   And I get out my phone, and I'm like,
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.360]   Connor, meet me at the front, I need you to come up here.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.980]   And they're like, if you can get Connor to come up here,
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.360]   we'll let you in.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.260]   And so I'm calling Connor, and my guys are like,
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.960]   yo, are you getting us in or not?
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.840]   And I'm starting to sweat, I'm starting to feel like,
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.760]   you know, such a buzz kill.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.120]   Connor won't answer his phone,
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.400]   you can hear everyone screaming,
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.400]   like something just crazy happened,
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.480]   like someone jumped off a roof,
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.240]   and I'm like, I gotta get in there.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.320]   And I start there because I think a lot of us,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.200]   in the same way, we are living life,
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.200]   and we think we know the president, or Jesus,
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.540]   and we're gonna be very disappointed and surprised
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.100]   if we were to get to heaven one day,
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.640]   and he looks and says, you're not in the list.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.320]   I don't know you, I'm sorry.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.380]   And I think a lot of us, when we think about that,
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.180]   we're like, wait, I don't necessarily like
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.360]   to talk about that, it's not a fun thing to talk about,
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.940]   because we love to talk about Jesus as the loving guy,
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.420]   we like to see the painting of Jesus
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.380]   with the lamb that he's petting, or with the children.
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.880]   We see Jesus as kind of like this softy,
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.820]   he's gentle, and grace-filled,
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.940]   and I mean, if he was truly loving and good,
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.140]   wouldn't he want everyone to come to heaven?
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.840]   And the answer is absolutely yes.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.160]   Jesus is all of those things.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.120]   And a lot of people like to talk about the loving Jesus,
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.260]   but the reality is, is he's not just the loving Jesus,
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.880]   but also the judging Jesus.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.540]   And I wanna be careful when I say that,
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:36.540]   because the Bible refers to Jesus a lot of times as a judge.
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.260]   And when I say that, I do not mean
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.820]   that he is looking for people,
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.400]   inflicting bad things on them,
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.620]   being a mean, angry God, judging people,
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.180]   I mean that he acts as a judge.
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:51.100]   The Bible says that people are gonna stand before him,
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.020]   and whether they believed in him or not
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.020]   will determine whether they get to spend eternity with him.
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.820]   And in that moment, he's acting as a judge.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.300]   But we think, and a lot of us think,
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.780]   oh, I know Jesus, I can get in,
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.620]   and to our surprise, when we get there,
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.880]   he says, "Depart from me, I never knew you."
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.220]   And just because the reality of what Jesus is saying here
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.800]   is that he's not going to let everyone in
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.980]   does not mean that his heart and his desire
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.300]   is not to want to be with everyone in heaven.
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.800]   Jesus wants everyone to be with him forever,
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.140]   but the reality is, is not everyone will be
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.180]   because they didn't believe him
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.180]   and take him at his word in their time on earth.
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:41.180]   I believe this message is the most shocking statement
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.720]   in all the statements that we've covered,
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.380]   because this isn't just talking about
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.140]   getting into some ATO party,
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.580]   this is talking about your eternity,
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.660]   where you're gonna spend life forever
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.680]   with your creator or separated from him.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.020]   And Jesus cares a lot that you know him
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.540]   and that you are with him.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.940]   And so what I wanna do with this message
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.860]   is not bring a lot of attention to like,
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.160]   oh, will I get to heaven?
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.840]   Because will I get to heaven
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.960]   is making you the focal point, and that's the problem.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.620]   But tonight, what we're gonna answer is,
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.440]   do you know Jesus?
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.980]   Do you actually know Jesus?
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.780]   Because when you answer and come to the realization of,
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.140]   do you actually know Jesus?
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.540]   The point of that equation is Jesus.
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.600]   And if you don't figure out now on earth
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.760]   that the point of everything is about Jesus
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.720]   and not yourself,
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.500]   you're gonna get to heaven and be disappointed
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.860]   when he doesn't let you in.
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:44.800]   The time to know Jesus is now, not then,
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.280]   because if you wait till then, it'll be too late.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.400]   That's what we're gonna see tonight.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.840]   And so as you take notes, for my note takers,
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.800]   this is how we can know and be assured
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.260]   that we know Jesus and he knows us.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.300]   So let's look at the first verse.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.480]   Let's talk about what it looks like to really know Jesus.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.380]   Verse 21.
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:12.020]   Jesus says, "Not everyone who says to me,
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:16.240]   "Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven."
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.900]   This shows me that saying you're a Christian
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.440]   does not make you a Christian.
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.180]   Okay?
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.820]   Many people will say to me, "Lord, Lord."
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.380]   And in that moment, they're saying,
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.680]   "Hey, you're Lord, you're Lord."
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.940]   But Jesus' response is like,
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.400]   "No, no, I don't know you.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.760]   "That's not true of you."
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.300]   Because you can declare with your mouth all day
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:45.300]   that Jesus is Lord, but do your actions exemplify that?
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.620]   Has that been your reality?
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.140]   Have you made him Lord of your life
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.240]   or just Lord of your mouth?
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.040]   Like if he just said he's Lord,
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.960]   because saying that he's Lord,
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.540]   saying you're a Christian does not make him
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.700]   Lord of your life, does not make you a Christian.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.780]   And we're gonna see that.
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.780]   Just like saying, "Hey, I'm a good singer,"
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.820]   does not make me a good singer.
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.660]   Like one of the biggest things that baffle me
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.660]   is American Idol contest,
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.580]   like videos on YouTube and Facebook.
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.380]   I'm watching and they do the same thing every time.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.340]   They like reel you in the first 15 seconds.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.180]   You're like, "Okay, I'm hooked.
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.620]   "I'm watching all eight minutes now."
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.460]   And you're watching and they do this like testimonial video
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.620]   and you're getting invested in their story.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.420]   And you're like, "I really hope like Megan makes it
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.260]   "to the end."
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.420]   And she's had a really hard upbringing
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.300]   and like got to get out of this small town
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.820]   and pursue her dream of Hollywood.
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.140]   And I'm rooting for Megan.
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.860]   And like, you're like,
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.020]   "This is about to be the best voice I've ever heard.
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.060]   "This is the next Carrie Underwood."
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.080]   And she walks out and the judges are like,
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.780]   "Megan, are you ready to change your life?"
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.500]   And she's like, "I am."
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.980]   And you're like, "Yes, Megan, Megan."
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:59.660]   And she walks up there and the song starts.
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.200]   And she's like,
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.060]   ♪ I can almost see it ♪
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.140]   ♪ These dreams I'm dreaming ♪
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.740]   And the judges, it's like immediately sweat forms.
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.740]   Like, you're sweating.
[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.420]   The judges are like watching and she's going
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:15.460]   and she's like, you know, getting like,
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.540]   it's the climb, the high note, but she's not hitting it.
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.180]   And you're just wanting it to end now.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.140]   And it gets to the end and she's standing there
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.360]   and, you know, Simon and the other ones are just like,
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.100]   is that not his name?
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.980]   That's his name, right?
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:32.820]   Oh, the other ones, that's funny.
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.860]   Okay, got it, got it.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.820]   I don't even know the other ones' names.
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.320]   But he looks at him and he's like,
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.200]   "Hey, I don't know how you got here.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.640]   "I don't know who told you that you should be here,
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.240]   "but I'm gonna be a good friend to you
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.380]   "and a truth teller to you and tell you
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.620]   "that you are not in fact a good singer.
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.060]   "And you should end your desire to be a singer today."
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.940]   Some of you need to hear that right now.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.380]   That's the truth you need to hear and you can leave.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.880]   Like, you ain't a singer, all right?
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.260]   I'll be the friend and no one else will be.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.780]   You need to go pursue a real, anyways.
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.620]   But,
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:14.400]   and what's even more crazy,
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.060]   these people are trained professionals
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.840]   to decide who's good and who's not.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:25.760]   And the audacity of Megan to look at Simon, the king,
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.740]   and be like, "I don't care what you say, Simon.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.260]   "Like, I am a singer."
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.140]   And they take the private interview after
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.500]   and she's like, "I'm going back and I'm still going.
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.620]   "Like, you know, forget Simon."
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.960]   But the reality is, is the judge had the final say.
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.980]   Like, Megan didn't get to go on
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:50.280]   because the judge told her, "Hey, you're not a singer."
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.900]   And I think a lot of us,
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.800]   we think because we say, "I'm a Christian.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.440]   "I'm a Christian, yeah, I know Jesus.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.660]   "Yeah, I'm a Christian."
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:05.080]   But when your life sings, it sounds nothing but atrocious.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.300]   And my fear is, is you're gonna get to heaven
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.900]   and you're gonna receive for the first time
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.500]   someone telling you, "Hey, you're not a Christian,"
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.300]   is the judge, that is Jesus.
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.460]   And it's gonna be too late.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:26.560]   Saying you're a Christian doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:31.060]   Saying you're a Christian does not mean you live
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.140]   in a way that glorifies Christ.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:38.140]   It's about a matter of the heart, not your words,
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.100]   not just professing, but what is actually real.
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.160]   And Jesus is saying, "Hey, not everyone who says to me,
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.260]   "Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.680]   "You can say one thing, but what's real?
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.340]   "Am I actually Lord of your life?"
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:58.420]   In the same way, it's the same with friendships.
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.640]   I think the reason why so many of us live this way
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.300]   with Jesus and have this kind of relationship with Him,
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.600]   where we just say we're a Christian,
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.500]   but yet we don't actually live Christ-like,
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.020]   is because we do this with people all around us every day.
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.220]   Like there's something that we are like programmed to do
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.260]   that I've noticed, especially in like our young adult years,
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260]   is we want to be known by everyone.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260]   And we want everyone to think that we know everyone.
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.640]   Like it brings some sort of significance to our life,
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.200]   especially people that are important
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.300]   and can bring more significance to us.
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.200]   So we'll do anything.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.700]   We'll stretch anything to make ourself feel inside
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.580]   of our mind like we know them.
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.660]   I have a few examples here that, you know,
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.380]   just because you say, yeah, that's my friend,
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.680]   doesn't mean it's your friend.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.220]   The first example is we have the Dap 'Em Up friend.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.540]   You know that person that like,
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.980]   you don't ever actually have a conversation.
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.980]   They like show up at the crib or the party
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.500]   and they're just like, what up, man?
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.700]   And then like they bounce and you like, don't ever,
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.220]   like where did he go?
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.740]   Like, that's all they are.
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.900]   And you've done it like five times,
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.200]   maybe throughout college or since you've lived in Dallas.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.980]   And then when someone says, hey, do you know so-and-so?
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.440]   Do you know, I don't know, Mark?
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.260]   You're like, yeah, I know Mark.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.140]   That's my homie.
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.380]   That's my guy.
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.580]   Reality is, is like you've dapped and dipped
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.100]   like every single time.
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.740]   You don't know Mark.
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.340]   You know nothing about Mark.
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:23.780]   So many of us have dapped and dipped with Jesus.
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.680]   Like there was a time at youth camp
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.020]   or there was that worship service,
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.480]   or there was that time that your friend told you
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.180]   about Jesus or your parents told you about Jesus
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.300]   for the first time.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.520]   And you're like, okay, what's up?
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.360]   I like this.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.200]   A life of blessings, a life of peace, you say.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.300]   Heaven, you say?
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.660]   Okay, what's up Jesus?
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.440]   But then you dipped.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.120]   Nothing changed.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.100]   And people today are you like, hey, do you know Jesus?
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.060]   You're like, yeah, I know Jesus.
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.380]   But you've just met him once.
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.540]   You don't know him.
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.380]   Another example is what I call
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.460]   the follow for follow friendship.
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.420]   I know what I'm talking about.
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.620]   Instagram, you know, we're like,
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.460]   you're like, hey, follow me.
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.100]   I'll follow, you know, follow back.
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.420]   Hashtag follow for follow.
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.300]   We are weird, okay?
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.240]   I'm not even gonna ask you to raise your hand
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.520]   'cause I know most of you have this reality.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.380]   So many of us, we have so many friends
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.140]   that we have never actually met,
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.200]   but we know everything about their life.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.600]   Like let's say my friend Teresa over here is like,
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.480]   yeah, I have my friend over in Kansas.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.200]   His name is Anthony and he's so awesome.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.280]   Y'all would be great friends.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.120]   And then she goes to Kansas and visits Anthony
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.000]   and posts Anthony.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.320]   And then I'm like, okay, cool, Anthony.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.160]   She's like, we'd be friends.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.000]   I follow Anthony.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.360]   Anthony follows me.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.080]   And I'm like watching Anthony's life.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.080]   He's watching mine.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.400]   We reply to each other's stories every now and then.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.880]   And then like the first time you meet Anthony,
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.480]   you're like, this is kind of awkward.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.400]   'Cause like, y'all know what I'm talking about.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.160]   You're like, I know you.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.840]   Like, but the reality is you don't know him.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.160]   Like, I don't know Anthony.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.400]   And I think so many people have done this
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.840]   like follow for follow friendship with Jesus
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.160]   where you're like, hey, I'll follow you, Jesus.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.520]   If you follow my agenda, my plans, my wants,
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.880]   my desires every now and then,
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.080]   like your relationship with Jesus has been through a screen
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.840]   or it's just been something really quick.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.240]   And reality is you might know things about him
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.400]   or stories about him, but you don't know him.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.000]   You have no substance with him.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.940]   Another example is what I call the mutual friend friendship.
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:35.680]   Like we all have that friend that you go
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.080]   and you, people say, hey, do you know,
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.880]   I'm having to come up with these names, Josiah.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.560]   I'm just naming my friends down here.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.360]   You know Josiah?
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.360]   And let's say that I don't know Josiah,
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.680]   but my friend Christian knows Josiah.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.240]   And I'm like, but I want to come off like Josiah's cool
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.080]   and he has a great jawline and he's buff and teaches good.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.160]   And I'm like, I want to know Josiah.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.080]   I want to act like I know Josiah.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.040]   So I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know Josiah.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.920]   Reality is, I don't know Josiah.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.000]   Christian knows Josiah.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.280]   He's a mutual friend.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:15.040]   Good, great guy to know.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.900]   But that's just a mutual friend.
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:20.080]   I know nothing about Josiah.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.440]   I'm banking off Christian's relationship with Josiah
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.540]   to determine mine.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:28.060]   And so many of us have a mutual friendship connection
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.840]   with Jesus only.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.920]   You're writing off the mutual connection with your parents.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.360]   You've been writing on your parents' faith
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.480]   for far too long.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.180]   You've been writing on your friend's faith.
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.800]   Like when something goes bad in your life,
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.340]   you hit up that really spiritual friend
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.680]   who seems to like have it together and you hit them up
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.520]   and you're like, hey, yo,
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.660]   you think you could like pray for me?
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.120]   Like you're closer to God than I am.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.080]   And you've been writing off these other relationships,
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.840]   these mutual connections to Jesus
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.940]   without having your own connection to him.
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.260]   And the last one I have is what I call
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.580]   the glow up friendship.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.920]   We know these people that at one point in life,
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.880]   they were just normal people.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.920]   Maybe you went to high school together
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.800]   or you went to college together
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.000]   and you didn't really treat them like anything special
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.400]   because they were just like, they were just normal.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.200]   And then one day you're creeping on Facebook
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.600]   and it's been forever since you've seen them
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.120]   and whoa, in some way they've made it.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.960]   They became an influencer, they lost a bunch of weight,
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.800]   they're doing like a fitness program thing
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   or they're like super successful in business.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.040]   They started a company,
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.880]   they become famous on TikTok or something like that.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.000]   And you find yourself like, what's up man?
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.160]   Or hey girl, like, how's it going?
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.800]   And it's the glow up friendship
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.800]   because now that they are something
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.480]   and they're somebody, you wanna come around
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.940]   so you can feel important.
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:54.960]   I think so many of us, when we get before Jesus,
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:59.120]   standing at the gates of heaven and we see him,
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.040]   he's in a glow up in our minds
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.820]   and we're gonna be like, oh no.
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.240]   On earth, like you were kind of just like insignificant
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.800]   to me, kind of just normal, everyone just talked about you
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.540]   but you weren't like important enough to me.
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.160]   And suddenly you're like, hey Jesus,
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.600]   like remember me, I went to the porch.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.720]   Like, gonna let me in, like, can I come backstage?
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.360]   And you have this glow up friendship with Jesus.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:28.400]   And if I ask you and you're in any of these categories,
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.040]   hey, do you know Jesus?
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.800]   And you were to say yes, based off of one of these,
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.880]   you don't know him.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.900]   That's not a friendship.
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.080]   That's not a relationship.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.320]   A relationship takes time.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.920]   It takes proximity.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.640]   It takes repetition and hard work.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.400]   It takes learning and being eager to learn.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.640]   It takes love and devotion.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.440]   That's how you get to know someone.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.820]   That's a real relationship.
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:04.000]   The reality is, is none of these things that I've mentioned
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.840]   are real relationships.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:11.840]   And I want you to ask yourself, do I really know Jesus?
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:19.760]   Like, do I just say Lord, Lord,
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.920]   or do I come here and just sing songs about Jesus?
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.140]   Or do I say all the right things?
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.960]   But the reality is, is he is Lord with my words,
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.160]   but not Lord in my life.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.720]   There's no real relationship.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:37.920]   Because simply knowing his name, Jesus is saying here,
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.820]   that's not it.
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.040]   James puts it this way in James 2, 19.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.720]   He says, "You say you have faith,
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.240]   "for you believe that there is one God.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.640]   "Good for you."
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.040]   It's like a whoop-de-doo moment.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:57.040]   Even the demons believe this and they tremble in terror.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.700]   The demons live in the supernatural realm.
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.100]   They live in the spiritual realm.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.780]   And so they have no choice but to believe
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.300]   in Jesus's existence.
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.660]   They see him, they've seen what he's done.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.020]   They saw him die on the cross.
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.060]   They know that he exists.
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:16.640]   And I think a lot of us tonight,
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.620]   we believe that God is a good thing.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.900]   We believe that God is real.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.840]   We believe that Jesus exists,
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.560]   but we have the same problem as the demons.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.320]   And hold up, I'm not calling y'all demons.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.180]   But we share the same problem here,
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.720]   because while they know he exists,
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.720]   their actions tell me that they don't see him as Lord.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.940]   They see him as real, but they don't see him as Lord.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.640]   And I think so many of us, we come here
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.060]   because we believe that Jesus is a good thing,
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.320]   or heaven is a fun place that we wanna end up with.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.280]   It's better than hell.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.880]   And we see Jesus as a friend or like a guy that we can go to,
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.200]   but we don't see him as Lord.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.460]   It's done nothing to produce change in our life.
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:02.040]   But when you know Jesus, you're gonna see him,
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.200]   everything changes.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.920]   And the sad part is, is James says that
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.400]   even the demons believe this,
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.780]   and they tremble in terror.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:20.780]   The demons see Jesus and tremble in terror.
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:27.180]   That means that they have some kind of recognition
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:31.100]   of what he's capable of, of who he actually is.
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:35.220]   And my fear is, is that even demons
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.480]   have a more appropriate response to Jesus
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.580]   than the very people who claim to be his own children.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.220]   Like even demons, I'll say it one more time,
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.580]   even demons have a more appropriate response
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.940]   in fearing and trembling at the name of Jesus
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.440]   than even those who claim to be his own children.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.580]   Because it gets really easy in this watered down version
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.520]   of Christianity in America today
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.100]   to come into places like this and to forget
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:07.660]   the power of the name of Jesus.
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.380]   We come here and sometimes, I mean,
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.080]   I just wanna throw a righteous fit
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.460]   because we are singing songs about the testimony of Jesus
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.060]   pulling us out of darkness and into light.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.540]   And I look around and I see,
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:24.860]   this is my testimony from death to life.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.640]   I'm like, well, someone sing like they believe it.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.900]   The demons believe and they tremble.
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:36.580]   They have a response when they see Jesus as real.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.860]   When you see Jesus, there is always a response to follow
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:46.020]   when you truly see Jesus.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:49.980]   But I think a lot of us haven't truly experienced Jesus.
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:56.440]   Sure, we say I'm a Christian or yeah, I know about Jesus,
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.220]   but you don't know him.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:04.260]   And Jesus is saying, many, that sobering many
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:07.060]   will stand before me and say, Lord, Lord,
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.460]   that will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:14.500]   I don't want that to be us.
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.700]   I don't want him just to be Lord from our mouth.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.400]   I want him to be Lord of our life.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:26.660]   So what does it look like to really know him?
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.500]   If it's not just to profess and just say, yeah,
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.020]   I'm a Christian, what does it look like
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.500]   to have a real relationship with him?
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.580]   Jesus continues the verse and he says this,
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.300]   not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord,
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.260]   will enter the kingdom of heaven,
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:43.820]   but the one who does the will of my father,
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.100]   who is in heaven.
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.780]   So what is the will of his father?
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.900]   His father being God, what is the will of God?
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.700]   Before I tell us what the will of God is,
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.420]   I want to make sure that we understand what it is not.
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.420]   Jesus lists out what it is not.
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.100]   The will of God is not a relationship,
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:08.100]   or the will of God is not a resume of religious actions.
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.940]   Let me say it one more time.
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:14.100]   The will of God or a real relationship with Jesus
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:18.900]   is not a resume of religious actions.
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.380]   Because when we hear, hey, do the will of my father,
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.060]   that word do, it can be a red flag to some of us.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.420]   And I get it because we say all the time here,
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.220]   it's not about what you do, it's all about what he's done.
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.780]   It's not about what you do, nothing that you can do.
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.420]   Ephesians 2, eight through nine says,
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.940]   not by your own works that no man may boast,
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.580]   but by grace through faith.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.540]   Titus 3, five says, he saved us,
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.060]   not because of works done by us in righteousness,
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.540]   but according to his own mercy.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.800]   There is nothing that you can do.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.860]   Jesus is not saying to do something.
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:52.180]   He even expounds on that with the next verse.
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.740]   Here's what he says.
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.420]   On that day, many will say to me,
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.580]   Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.580]   or do in your name?
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.980]   Did we not cast out demons in your name?
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.780]   Do we not do many mighty works in your name?
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:11.820]   And then Jesus says, I never knew you'd depart from me.
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.040]   And I read this and this is why this verse haunted me
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.060]   for all my life.
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:18.580]   On my best weeks, I mean,
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.620]   I'm just trying to read my Bible every day, y'all.
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.500]   Like I'm being honest.
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.300]   I'm trying to like pray every day, read my Bible every day.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.580]   And on my best days, I ain't casting out demons.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.940]   I ain't never, I'm not casting out a demon yet.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.240]   I say yet.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:37.340]   I'm not hearing the heavens open up and God speaking to me
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.540]   and saying, go and prophesy to the people of the porch.
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:40.980]   I haven't done that.
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:41.820]   I haven't.
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:49.300]   And these people are standing before Jesus and are like,
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.080]   we have casted out demons.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.760]   We've prophesied in your name.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.660]   We've done many signs and wonders in your name.
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.780]   And he's like, nope, not enough.
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.420]   Depart from me, never knew you.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.780]   Ain't nobody safe in these streets.
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:04.780]   Like I'm out here, like I haven't even touched that resume.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:10.820]   But that's the point that Jesus is making.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.300]   It's not about a religious resume.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.720]   It's not about religious activity.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.460]   He doesn't want your activity.
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.740]   Again, he wants proximity.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.860]   He wants you.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.940]   Now what you can do, he's telling these guys,
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.680]   hey, the best of the best of the religious leaders,
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.280]   that's the today, like the Bible study leaders,
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.680]   the theologians, the people who pray all the time,
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:39.500]   like the people who spend just hours and hours serving
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.140]   and helping widows and orphans,
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.940]   like doing and doing and doing.
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.200]   Are those all good things?
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.920]   Yes, but they're not the thing.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.480]   What Jesus wants is not your works.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.300]   He wants you.
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.620]   He wants your heart.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.860]   He wants your devotion, your adoration, your affections.
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.380]   He wants you to trust him.
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.680]   He wants your love because he loves you.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.120]   He loves you.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.000]   He doesn't want a religious resume.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.880]   And that is the most freeing thing,
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.220]   to exhale and go,
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.320]   because for years in my life,
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.880]   I thought if I just prayed enough,
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.360]   if I just talked about God enough,
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.960]   if I just came to church enough,
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.520]   if I was just the perfect preacher's kid,
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.000]   if I did all these right things
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   and said all these right things in front of the right people,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.160]   then look, God will be smiling down on me.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:34.520]   And I kept striving and striving and striving.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.000]   And some of you, you've been striving
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.400]   for your relationship with God your whole life
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.740]   because it's up to you.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.860]   But he's saying here,
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.360]   people are gonna come and just list off all these things
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.920]   that they think are impressive
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.840]   and that they think they've done in my name.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.240]   But I don't want a religious resume.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.800]   I want a relationship with you.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.640]   Right now, I'm trying to hire two people
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.960]   to work with me at the porch
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.140]   and lots of resumes, lots of resumes.
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.080]   If it's one of you, I'm sorry we haven't gotten back to you.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.440]   We're working through them.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:12.600]   And it's so funny, like I do this too.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.400]   I'm an Enneagram three, the achiever.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.680]   We write our resumes.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.200]   What we're doing is we're like thinking
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.520]   about the person receiving the resume.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.540]   And so the reality is, is you ran social media
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.880]   for your cousin's startup photography business.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.600]   But on the resume, you're like social media manager
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.800]   for a local photography business in Dallas, Texas.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.320]   And it's like your cousin's startup.
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.000]   And it's like got three followers
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.680]   and we'll do anything to make ourselves sound
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.940]   more impressive.
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:48.080]   And I think Jesus is saying here, hey,
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.860]   you can come before me and try to list up
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.160]   all these impressive spiritual acts
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.960]   on this religious resume and it doesn't matter.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:59.300]   I'm not impressed by your deeds.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.640]   I want you, I want you.
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:08.220]   Being a Christian is not just doing Christian things.
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.560]   It's not just coming to the porch.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.180]   It's not just reading a Devo,
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.480]   but it's entering into a real intimate,
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:22.480]   devoted relationship with Jesus.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.900]   So what does that actually look like?
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.080]   If it's not these things, if it's not just reading my Bible,
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.220]   if it's not just coming to church, then what is it?
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:36.840]   He says this, "Who gets into heaven?
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.660]   "Who spends eternity with me?
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.900]   "The one who does the will of my father who is in heaven."
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:45.920]   Knowing Jesus, knowing that you know,
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:50.720]   that you know, that you know is doing the will of God.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.400]   And I think every, we get asked all the time here,
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.120]   how do I know what God's will is for my life?
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.560]   Like, I think we think that there's like three doors
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.300]   and God's like, my will is picking the right door
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.140]   and it's all up to you.
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.760]   And it's like, how do I know which job or which person
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.840]   or which thing, which next step, what should I do?
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.200]   And we're like, all so concerned
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.360]   about God's will for my life, God's will for my life.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.960]   And we're missing the point because God makes his will
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.260]   for every Christian's life really simple,
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.480]   but it changes everything if you would just do it.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:25.100]   And it's this, in John chapter six, verse 29,
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:28.120]   Jesus speaking again, it says,
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:31.880]   "This is the only work God wants from you,
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:36.120]   "believe in the one he has sent."
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.040]   What's God's will?
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.840]   Believing in his son, believing in his plan
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.560]   for humanity, believing what we call the gospel,
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.560]   the good news that Jesus, God's one and only son
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:53.520]   left heaven and came and stepped down into our dirt,
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.680]   into our mess, into our broken world,
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.720]   yet he remained perfect, making him the perfect sacrifice
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.660]   because our sin deserved a penalty.
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:07.880]   Our sin required a payment for a holy God.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.280]   And Jesus was that perfect payment.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.160]   He was sacrificed on the cross
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:16.480]   and there the wrath of God poured out on him.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.920]   And it should have been us.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.840]   He died in our place.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:26.040]   He came and died and was buried and rose again
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:30.040]   so that we could know him and make him known
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.200]   and live forever with him.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.440]   And he says, you wanna know the will of God to believe that?
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:39.520]   To believe the best news ever shared?
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.960]   To believe that God is so obsessed with you,
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.320]   God loves you so much that he would do anything
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.500]   to be with you forever?
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.040]   Jesus isn't some dictator up there that's like,
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.680]   you, not you, not enough, you, nope, nope, nope.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.720]   He's like, I want all of you, I died for you.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:59.480]   And if you wanna be with me,
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.720]   I just need you to believe, trust, love,
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:07.080]   believe that I am for you, I am with you,
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.960]   I died for you, I love you,
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.440]   and enter into relationship with me.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.340]   Why is Jesus so obsessed with this idea of belief?
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:21.520]   Like, why does Jesus want us so badly to believe
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.640]   that he loves us?
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.140]   It's because he knows that radical belief
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.200]   produces radical obedience.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:35.840]   And he knows that belief in him
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.100]   determines behavior for him.
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:43.340]   Belief determines our behavior.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:47.660]   And right now, when you look at your life
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.860]   and you look at your behaviors,
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.860]   what does it say about what you believe?
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.820]   Do you believe that he is Lord?
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:58.860]   Do you live like he is worthy of your all?
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.420]   Do you live like he is worthy of being worshiped?
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.100]   Do you say no to the things of the world?
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.920]   Do you say no to your own plans
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.220]   and live for his plans for your life?
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.480]   Do you live according to his word?
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.420]   Do you do the things that he wants?
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.980]   Do you say no to your sin and yes to him?
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.700]   What does your behavior say about your belief in Jesus?
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:25.840]   Because if you believe that he loves you,
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.500]   your right response is to receive that
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.640]   and respond in loving him in return,
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:35.980]   not loving the world, not loving yourself, loving him.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:41.360]   When you believe in Jesus, you receive eternal life
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.280]   and respond in this life
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.320]   and your life begins to produce fruit.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:53.200]   That's when the love of Jesus takes root in your life
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.540]   and produces fruit.
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:59.460]   When you believe that Jesus died for you and loves you,
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.920]   it takes root in your life and it produces behavior,
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.760]   it produces fruit of life change.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:09.060]   Falling in love leads to life change.
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.100]   I can testify.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.480]   I fell in love last year.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.760]   Her name's Jenna, she's not here tonight,
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.640]   she's watching online.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.480]   Hey, sweetie.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:23.420]   And guys, falling in love produces life change.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.720]   Everything's changing about my life.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.460]   Priorities are changing,
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.960]   the way I spend my time is changing,
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.640]   the way I'm pursuing people is changing,
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.960]   the ways that I'm communicating is changing,
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.480]   the ways that I'm cleaning things
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.180]   and serving in ways that I wasn't before is changing.
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:43.760]   Everything's changing
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:47.080]   because falling in love produces life change.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.060]   Me and her are in this thing right now at Watermark,
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:53.080]   it's a premarital class for eight weeks called Merge.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.160]   I would highly recommend,
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.120]   listen, I'm about to be a salesman.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.960]   If you are in a serious relationship
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.140]   or about to be engaged
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.700]   and you want a God-honoring, God-glorifying marriage,
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:02.800]   do Merge.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.840]   Don't think about it, just do it.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.080]   It is changing me.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.660]   I'm learning so much, it's amazing.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.320]   Merge, look it up, Watermark website.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.520]   But at Merge last week,
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.720]   we were talking about the roles of husband and wives
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.600]   and we sat down and I asked her questions like,
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.060]   hey, what can I better do to love and serve you?
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:25.400]   I wasn't asking people that before, I was worried about me.
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.240]   But falling in love produces life change.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.600]   She's looking at me and she's asking,
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.960]   hey, how can I better support you
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.160]   as a leader of our relationship?
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.480]   And woof.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.320]   But,
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.960]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.160]   I'm like, you keep asking that,
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.200]   you keep asking questions like that,
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.280]   you're doing just fine.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:45.560]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.960]   But we're asking these questions
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.720]   and we're doing the hard work
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.480]   of communicating and getting things right
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.520]   because we're in love.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.440]   And when you're in love, your life changes.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.960]   No more just Saturdays with the bros all the time.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.520]   I gotta ask my lady,
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.440]   can I have a Saturday with the bros?
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.040]   Things begin to change.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.320]   It's so cool, God's so just sovereign.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.880]   The video that started off Grant,
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.260]   that's the, he's gonna be the best man at my wedding.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.100]   My best friend.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.880]   And we had no idea that it was gonna line the night
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:17.200]   that like all of this kind of came together.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.500]   And we were watching the video today before this.
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.920]   And he talked about where everything changed for him
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.920]   is when he read Matthew 7,
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.640]   right before this part, Jesus said,
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.780]   hey, you will know them by their fruit.
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:33.140]   And I was like, Grant, that's what I'm talking about tonight
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.580]   that falling in love leads to life change.
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.740]   That when a belief in Jesus takes root in one's life,
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.480]   it produces fruit that changes you.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.860]   That when you believe in Jesus,
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.000]   your behaviors begin to change.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.040]   And guys, Grant tonight is actually sitting
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.220]   in the left top corner.
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.600]   I can't remember which one he said,
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.180]   but he's sitting up there and you know why?
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.920]   He's been serving at the porch and doing different things
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:01.100]   and he's sitting up there because he said,
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.460]   I wanna remember how far Jesus has brought me.
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:07.420]   Because now he serves down here sometimes.
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.340]   And as he watched this story of grace tonight,
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.500]   he said, I used to come to the porch,
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.600]   professing Jesus with my mouth,
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.140]   saying I followed Jesus,
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.100]   but there was nothing different in my life.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.900]   And he would come here week after week and sit up there.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:27.320]   But Jesus was chasing after him.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:31.060]   Saying, Grant, I want your all.
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.540]   I want your heart's affections,
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.780]   not your religious actions, I want you.
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:39.700]   And guys, as someone who has been walking closely,
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:40.860]   best man at my wedding,
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.140]   I have seen Jesus take so much root in his life.
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.340]   There's been so much fruit
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.820]   that is just overflowing out of him.
[00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:48.900]   You heard it in his story.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.100]   And now he's gonna tell more and more people about Jesus.
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.500]   That's happening every Tuesday night here
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.820]   that someone says, I'm doing it.
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.560]   No more wondering, no more questioning,
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.320]   no more letting this passage and others like it haunt me.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.320]   I want to know that I know that I know
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:09.080]   that I'm in love with Jesus and he loves me.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.320]   And our lives begin to change.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.500]   Miracles take place every week down here up front.
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:18.880]   And fruit, the fruits of the spirit,
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.480]   the Bible says in Galatians,
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.400]   love and joy and peace and patience,
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.980]   kindness, gentleness, self-control, faithfulness.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.100]   That's what begins to mark their life.
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.000]   That's what begins to come out of them
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.380]   because they were changed by Jesus.
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.540]   And Jesus is saying, hey,
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.140]   you want to spend eternity with me?
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.140]   Know the will of my father.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:49.780]   That's how, believe that he sent me to die for you
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:54.120]   so that you can live for him.
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:58.860]   That night we had given up hope at that ATO party
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.980]   and we were walking away just thinking like, you know what?
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.980]   I don't think I can, I don't think Connor's gonna come.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.880]   Let's go home.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.100]   And I hear JD.
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.420]   And I knew, I knew his voice 'cause we had lived together.
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.320]   And I turn around and I see Connor and he's like,
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:16.300]   get in here, they're with me, they're with me.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.820]   And my chest came out and I looked at those pledges.
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:24.180]   I grabbed my friends and I walked through those, the gate.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:28.660]   Because my relationship with Connor
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:32.740]   gave me the credentials to come into the party.
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:36.540]   That's what I want for you.
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:41.700]   I want your relationship with Jesus to define your life
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:42.820]   in such a way
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:49.060]   that you get to join the party in heaven
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:53.380]   for all of eternity, lifting up hands, singing to God.
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:58.380]   And I want you to know that you know, that you know
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.940]   that you're not gonna be someone that Jesus looks at
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.900]   and says, hey, I don't know you.
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:04.580]   You're not gonna be someone that just said,
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:08.260]   I'm a Christian, but live like the world.
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:11.620]   You're not gonna be someone that did the things,
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:14.020]   the church things or the Instagram bios
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:17.220]   that said, yeah, I'm a Christian,
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:19.700]   but instead of doing and doing,
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.180]   you spent time being intimate and getting to know Jesus.
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:26.340]   And because of that, when that day comes,
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:32.260]   you're so sure because you spent your time on earth
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:35.240]   knowing your Lord in heaven.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:38.220]   That's my hope.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.040]   If that's not you tonight,
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:44.080]   there is no better time than tonight to get it right.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:47.620]   To come down front and say, I wanna know,
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.180]   I wanna know, I wanna know
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:52.660]   that I get to be with Jesus forever,
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.980]   not to get some security of heaven and not hell,
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.820]   but 'cause I just am so in love with Jesus
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.000]   'cause he loves me.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.740]   That's what you want.
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:03.420]   Jesus is the goal.
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.260]   Jesus is the point.
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:06.380]   I just wanna be where he is.
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.020]   And if he's gonna be in heaven forever,
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.340]   that's where I wanna be.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.660]   That can be true of you tonight.
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:18.680]   John 1:12 says, "But to all who did receive him,
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:22.620]   "who called on his holy name,
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:26.300]   "he gave the right to become children of God."
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:31.260]   How can you know that you know Jesus?
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.020]   Make him Lord of your life.
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:35.020]   Enter into a relationship with him
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:37.740]   and walk with him till heaven.
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:38.580]   Let's pray.
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:43.160]   God, thank you for your son, Jesus.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.100]   Jesus, we worship you.
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:46.420]   We praise you, Father.
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:49.580]   We praise you that you loved us enough
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:54.220]   to send your son down to earth to give us this message,
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:56.340]   a message of hope, a message that says,
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.740]   hey, it is my one desire that I am with
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.860]   every single child in heaven.
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:04.060]   And so take heed of this warning
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:07.060]   that many people are gonna come and say, Lord, Lord.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:10.820]   I don't want the things that they say, I want them.
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:12.020]   Many are gonna come and say,
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.380]   but God did and I did and I,
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:14.660]   and he goes, I don't want the things that you did,
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:15.500]   I want you.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:21.140]   So God, if there's someone tonight
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.780]   that thinks it's up to them
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.920]   or thinks that you're not worth it,
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:30.700]   would you change their heart right now?
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.620]   Would we see you as the prize?
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.920]   Would you see you as worth it?
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:39.820]   Would we understand your love for us?
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:42.300]   The links that you went through,
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.400]   that you could be in a relationship with us forever.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:49.940]   And may that belief in you change our behavior
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.300]   and allow us to respond accordingly.
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:58.740]   We wanna be people who know you
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:02.020]   and to let what we know to be true,
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:06.100]   to change how we live forever until heaven.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:07.180]   We are living for heaven.
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:09.340]   We are living for you.
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:10.440]   We worship you.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.060]   We worship with the angels
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.340]   and all of your people in heaven right now.
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:16.620]   In your name that I pray, amen.
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:17.660]   Let's stand and sing.
