[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   (Music)
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   You guys know what Friday is?
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Yeah, the Olympics, man.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   It's like one person knows and the whole crowd.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Wow.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   So Friday, just so you guys know, the Olympics, the Winter Olympics starts.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   So a buddy of mine, a close friend of mine,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   was actually in the Torino Games, the Vancouver Games.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   He won a gold, two silver, and two bronze.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   And so what you're going to see on Friday, he and I were talking.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   He was in town this weekend, and we actually talked today.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   And what you're going to see, and you guys know this,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   but it's like the greatest athletes in the world.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   But no one's just kind of going out there for the first time, right?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   No one's just kind of stepping on the skating rink
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   or going out there on the halfpipe for the first time, just strapped to snow.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Could you imagine if Louis Vitto couldn't go,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   and he said, "Hey, JP, would you step in for me this round?"
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Like that would be embarrassing.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Why would that be so bad?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Like why would I be so bad?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Because I can't snowboard, I'll have you know.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   But I can't snowboard like Louis Vitto can snowboard.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Because Louis Vitto, as you just saw, he's been training his whole life for that moment.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   He's been training his whole life for that moment.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Like everything has come to that place, the culmination of that halfpipe.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   It started on sidewalks with skateboards, man.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It started when he was five years old, and he got that first snowboard for Christmas.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   It started when his driveway froze over, and so he goes out there.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Now, I don't know if he knew when his driveway froze over when he was five,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   and he strapped the snowboard to his feet, and he slid down it.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   I don't know if he knew that that would lead to the Olympics.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   But that's exactly what it did.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And every single moment of your life is training for some future moment.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Every single moment of your life is training for some future moment.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Like I was talking to my buddy, and my buddy's from Houston, Texas,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   and he was in the Winter Games in speed skating, ice skating.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Like how does a boy from Houston compete in the Olympic Games and win a gold medal for speed skating?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Well, here's how. I'll tell you how.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   His dad owned a skating rink. Not ice, but roller.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And so he grew up roller skating all the time, all the time.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And then when inline skates came out, he bought a pair.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And he started inline skating all the time, and then he started inline racing,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   and that led to ice skating, and that led to the Olympics.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Do you see how these moments in his life had led to this reality, this destiny, if you will?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Hey, guys, your life is no different.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Like what I see is I spend so much time with hundreds, thousands even, of 20 and 30-somethings.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   We lack this long vision for our lives.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   We focus so much in the moment, and we don't realize that what we are becoming
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   is what we now are practicing, what we are now training for.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And I tell you all the time, like, great husbands and wives don't just happen.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Great dads and moms don't just happen.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Great elders in the church.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   It's not like somebody woke up one day, trusted Christ, and was like, "You know, I think I'll be an elder today."
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   The Scripture actually warns us against that.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Don't be quick to lay hands on someone.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   What you are practicing for right now, what you are training for, is what you are becoming.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And we're moving through this series called "Resolutions."
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And as I think and reflect on resolutions, what's interesting is no one resolves to ruin their lives.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Like, that would be crazy.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Like, no one goes at life and is like, "You know what? I really want to be divorced by the time--
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I resolve to be divorced by the time I'm 33.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I resolve to have a child out of wedlock.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I resolve to get this STD.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I resolve to get laid off next week.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   That would be fun."
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   No one does that.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Like, we all resolve towards these great things, but the reality of it is,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   the Scriptures tell us that if we do not gain wisdom, that if we do not gain knowledge,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   we will resolve to ruin.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   That's the crazy thing.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Ruin just happens.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   It actually happens from not doing the other things, not pursuing wisdom.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Ruin happens.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   In fact, I'll read to you from Hosea 4, 6.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   It says, "My people are destroyed by their lack of knowledge."
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   It says in the Scriptures.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   "My people are destroyed by their lack of knowledge."
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   See, no one has to resolve to ruin.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Ruin is what happens when you don't seek a greater wisdom to live your life from.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Like, when you just go through life and you just follow your own desires,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   you just kind of go with your feelings and your emotions,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   and you follow your heart into traps.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Ruin is what happens.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   It's what ensues.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And so how do we guard our life against it?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Tonight we're going to talk about resolutions that ruin lives and our need for God's wisdom.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Resolutions that ruin lives and our need for God's wisdom.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   It is always my preference to take you to a passage of Scripture and exegete that passage
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   or teach line by line through that passage.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   It is always my preference to present to you clearly the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   But that is not what I'm going to do tonight.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Tonight will be like drinking from a fire hose or fire hydrant, if you will.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   So how many points do I usually teach with?
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Anybody?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Three points, usually.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Tonight we have ten.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   So buckle up, grab a pen and a paper.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   We're going to go fast.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Grab what is relevant to you.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Forget what isn't.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Feel free to daydream.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   No, I'm just saying don't do that.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   I'll just bring you up here and then we can talk to you about that.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   So week one was resolved to be used through surrender.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   That was week one.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And then week two, last week, with the cage up here, with the jail cell,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   it was resolved to be free from sin through dependence.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And so week three tonight is resolved to seek wisdom over ruining our lives.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   We're going to look specifically at what God's Word said.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   We're going to be in the book of wisdom, the Proverbs.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   So you can just write these down.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   We're going to look at why a loving God would give us this instruction.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And before you leave here this evening,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   we're going to talk about the very things that we should resolve to that won't ruin our lives.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Kind of the antithesis of the resolutions towards ruin.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And so we wrapped up last year in Ecclesiastes.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   In fact, we finished the year in Ecclesiastes 12,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   where Solomon just says, "Remember your Creator in the days of your youth."
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   He did not say, "Remember God in the days of your youth."
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   He did not say, "Remember the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   He did not say, "Remember Jehovah in the days of your youth."
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   He said very specifically, "Remember that you were created intentionally."
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Like, do you know who best knows how to use an invention?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Do you know who best knows how to use some creation?
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   The one who created it.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   The one who formed it.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   The one who purposed it.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   The one who invented it.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   You were invented very specifically by God the Creator.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And He says, "Hey, you remember Me when you are young."
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   "Remember the reality that I made you and that My instruction is better than yours when you're young."
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   When you're young.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Solomon, who wrote Ecclesiastes, is the wisest man ever to live other than Jesus Christ.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   He also wrote much of what is known as the Book of Wisdoms, the Proverbs.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   They were wrote in majority by King Solomon.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   This is the Book of Wisdom in the Bible.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   A book that is given to us by God, entrusted to us by God.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   It has this collection of writings called the Book of Wisdom or the Proverbs.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   This is what we turn to for practical life application.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Most of the Proverbs is just direct application.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Tonight we're going to look at just about a dozen of them.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   What are the resolutions that will ruin your life?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   What are the resolutions that will ruin your life?
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   You can ruin your life by, number one, believing that ideas do not have consequences.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Number one, believing that ideas do not have consequences.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   This is the Proverbs. It's in chapter 1, verse 29.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   It says, "Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the Lord,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   For the waywardness of the simple will kill them,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   and the complacency of fools will destroy them.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   That which the complacent fools sow, it will destroy them."
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   These ideas that they have, these actions that they sow through those ideas,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   they have consequences.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Proverbs 15, verse 18 says it like this,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   "The simple believe anything, but the prudent give thought to their steps."
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   This is, in the book of Wisdom, the idea of the law of the harvest.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   We see this expounded on in Galatians 6,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   where Paul just writes to the church in Galatia,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   "You will reap what you sow. You sow an action.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   You're going to reap a re-action,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   and it's going to be more than you sowed, usually later than you sowed it,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   but it will be exactly what you sowed."
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   This is the law of the harvest that God has wired into creation.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   This is the reality that today affects your tomorrow.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Who you are today, the way that you pursue God today,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   will define the way that you love God tomorrow.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   We all think we're going to wake up one day
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   and just have this deep desire and hunger and thirst
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   to open the Bible and just rip through it and memorize it.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   But the reality of it is that will be defined
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   by the way that you pursue God today.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   The relationships you have tomorrow
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   will be defined by the way you pursue relationships today.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Yesterday I was asked--I got to speak with a company over lunch,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   and they just asked me, "What was the biggest lie that you believed in your 20s?"
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And I simply said this, number one today,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   the lie that ideas do not have consequences.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Today I've been married nearly 10 years.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   This week my wife and I were in a discussion--we have an amazing marriage--
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   but this week we were in a discussion talking about how
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   the things that I did in my 20s had caused problems in our marriage today,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   10 years later, specifically in my marriage expectations.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   In fact, as I meet with and do lots--Monica and I together--
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   do lots of premarital counseling and marital counseling,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   I've never met anyone with marriage problems, ever.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   It's all single people problems brought into marriage.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   You see, it's all the problems that were created in their 20s and their 30s
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   that they bring into their marriage.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   And so every moment of your life is preparing you for another moment,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   a future moment.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   And so what do we do?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   This year, 2014, this is your year.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   I want you to resolve to walk with God.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   This year, you resolve to walk with God
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   and stop pursuing that which is going to bring death to your life.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   The number two way to ruin your life in your 20s,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   if you want to ruin your life in your 20s, is you can live outside your means.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   How do you ruin your life in your 20s?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   You live outside your means.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Proverbs 22, verse 7 says, "The rich rule over the poor,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   and the borrower is slave to the lender."
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   See, I meet with people all the time who are still paying for experiences
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   that they had 5 years ago, a decade ago.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   They're paying for buying decisions that they made a long time ago,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   and they can't take their excess and be generous with it,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   as the Scriptures call them to,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   because all of their excess goes to debt service.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Another thing that happens is, Monica and I do premarital counseling.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   This happens all the time.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   I'm going to do someone's wedding, or officiate the wedding.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   They come into our living room,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   and usually we get to talk with one or both of them
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   about the debt they are going to bring into the marriage,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   sometimes six figures of debt.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   And there's usually guilt and shame, like, "Hey, this was mine,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   and now it's going to be ours."
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   And those are things that they didn't think about.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   And I'm not trying to guilt you, or shame you, or make you feel bad for that,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   but I am trying to tell you that you need a plan.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   You need to think through, "Hey, how am I going to live below my means?"
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Here at Watermark, we offer a class called Money Wise.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Strongly, strongly, if you have a lot of student debt,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   or even consumer debt, I strongly encourage you to attend Money Wise.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   And let us help you put together a plan,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   so that you can vigorously try to pay that down,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   so that with your excess you can be generous.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   That you can live below your means.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   That's the resolution, right?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Resolve to live below your means,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   and vigorously pay off debt,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   so that you might be generous with your excess.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Another way to ruin your life in your 20s,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   number three, feed an addiction.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Feed an addiction.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   This is what we talked about yesterday,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   when the sin was in the cage, and you went in the cage,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   and then you're trapped in the sin.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   The proverb says it like this, Proverbs 11, verse 6,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   "The righteousness of the upright delivers them,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   but the unfaithful are trapped by evil desires."
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   They are trapped by the desires that they pursue,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   and they get stuck in them.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   1 Peter, chapter 2, says it like this,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   "Dear friends, I urge you, as people who do not belong to this world,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   to abstain from sinful," and listen to this,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   "desires which wage war against your soul."
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   There is a war going inside of you.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   You have to make war with that which wages war with your soul,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   these desires that you have.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Can I just hit you with a simple truth?
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   When you feed something, it grows.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   That's the simple truth.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   When you feed something, it grows.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   When you feed an addiction, the addiction gets bigger.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   So when you think, "Hey, one last time,"
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   that thing that you're trying to kill,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   it actually gets bigger by that one last time.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   That one last time actually makes it more difficult to kill that addiction.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   And so I think so many people in their 20s and 30s think,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   "Well, when I get married, I'll get right,"
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   or "Later in life, I'll stop that."
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   I had a friend tell me once,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   "I'll struggle with masturbation my entire life until I'm married."
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And like some of you, that might just make sense.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   You might just be freaked out that I said the N-word.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   [laughter]
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   But it's funny because I'm like, "Bro, I've got to break some news to you."
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   That which you do when you're single only grows in marriage.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Those problems that you have, those addictions that you have,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   when you bring someone else into that, those addictions only grow.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   They only get worse.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Now's the time to fight those addictions.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Now's the time.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Now is the time to seek healing.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   So I don't know for you if it's money.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Money can be an addiction, right?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Maybe it's sex or pornography, as I mentioned,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   or maybe it's shopping, right?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   You just kind of cope through shopping.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   These are all things that when you feed them, they get bigger, they grow.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Like none of you, if I said tonight,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   "Hey, how many of you, when you're 42 years old, do you want to be an alcoholic?"
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Like how many of you just would love to be a raging alcoholic by the time you're 42?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Like my guess is none of you would be like, "Well, I kind of want to."
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   The reality of it is that some of you will,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   and I can probably, just through a range of questions, figure out which ones will.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   It's the ones who are giving to drink in their 20s.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   That doesn't go away.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Like you ever wonder, "Man, how did somebody just become an alcoholic?"
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Well, it's because they loved the bar in their 20s.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   They loved to live there.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   That weekend warrior, "Man, I love to get--
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   "Man, let's go get smashed, dude.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   "Oh, it's a long day. You ready to go?
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   "Let's go get messed up, man.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   "Man, I just need to forget about this," right?
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Man, those are the folks--you feed that.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   It grows to an addiction.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   All of a sudden, you don't feel normal unless you have your medicine.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   I see it all the time.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   It's just logic. Like I'm not hitting you with anything crazy.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   That's just logic.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   That's how alcoholics happen.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   And I'm not trying to scare you either.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   I'm just hitting you with some very simple, very basic truth.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   This is how this works.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   That is the law of the harvest.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   That what you are doing today is defining who you are tomorrow.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   And so we need to resolve to starve our addictions.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   You want to see something die, you starve it.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Resolve to starve your addictions.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   This Monday night is regeneration at 630.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   You're invited, whether you struggle from an addiction to shopping,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   an addiction to pornography, sex, an addiction to smoking or alcohol,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   addiction to drugs, whatever it is, addiction to money,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   you can show up this Monday night.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   We would love to chat with you at 630 here at Watermark.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   Another way to ruin your life in your 20s--this is a huge one--
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   is to run with fools.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Number four, how do you ruin your life in your 20s?
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   You run with fools. You hang out with idiots.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Proverbs 13, verse 20 says,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   "Walk with the wise and become wise,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   for a companion of fools suffers harms."
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   This truth, this reality is really repeated throughout the Scriptures.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Bad company corrupts good character.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   This is said throughout the Scriptures, this idea.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   It goes over and over and over.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   And so here's the reality.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   You are becoming who you are hanging around with.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Fact.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   You are becoming who you are hanging around with.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   All of a sudden they're always sarcastic,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   and then you find yourself always sarcastic.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   They always use this word, it's a weird word to you at first,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   and then all of a sudden you catch yourself using that word.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   They go to these places, you think that's weird,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   you hang out with them,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   all of a sudden you start going out to those places.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   You are becoming who you are hanging out with.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   And it is a force stronger than you.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   You think, "No, I'm going to do ministry to them,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   I won't conform, I'm stronger than that."
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   No, you will conform.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   You were wired to.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   It's the way that we were created.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   We were meant to live in this idea of community,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   to be a part of a church.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   It's called Christ's body.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   You were literally designed and developed and invented
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   and created for it,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   that you would plug into the church
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   so that you would be hands and feet and eyes
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   and serve with the gifts that God has entrusted to you for Him.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   That you're using to watch Sex and the City
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   with a bunch of crazies.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Come on.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Kelly, I'm not looking at you, I was looking past you.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Just kidding.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   My friend, Kelly.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   And so I know some of you are like, "Wait a minute,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Jesus hung out with sinners.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Jesus hung out with sinners.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Let's think about that for a second, right?"
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Jesus shows up to sinners and He gives them a message.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   And then He takes the ones that believe on that message
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   and He begins to pour His life into them.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   The other ones, the ones that are stuck,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   He just keeps going.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   He shows up, He preaches the gospel.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   So you're like, "I've got a ministry to Lower Greenville, man.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   You don't understand.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   I've got this ministry to Uptown."
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Cool, show up in the bar.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   "Hey guys, let me show you.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Hey, everybody listen.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Put down the shot of Patron.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Hey, did you know Jesus Christ died for your sins?
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   And He raised the..."
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   "Hey, I'm going to go.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   If you want to follow me, you come with me.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   If not, you stay here, right?"
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   This is what Jesus did over and over and over again.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   So you want a ministry to Lower Greenville,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   a ministry to Uptown?
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Try that.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   But the reality of it is more times than not,
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   they're influencing you, not being influenced by you.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   See, they have a ministry to you too.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   The enemy has a ministry to you too.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   It's to bring you down, man.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   It is to disable your ministry
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   so that you would lose your voice.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   And you better believe you're stepping onto a battleground.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   And so you want to ruin your life in your 20s,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   you run with fools.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   And so what do we do?
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   We resolve to change our playmates and our playground.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   We say that all the time here.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   People are like, "Wait a minute, JP, man.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Are you telling me that if I want to follow this Jesus,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   I need to get all new friends
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   and I need to hang out in other places?"
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   In one word, yes.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   That's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Okay?
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   That is...
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   But it's really hard.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Hey, I did it.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Trust me.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   I know it's really hard.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   And you know who those friends called
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   when they went through that first and second divorce?
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   You know who those friends called when troubles hit?
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Who those friends called when they were let off?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   They remembered their old buddy
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   who left them for Jesus.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   And I said, "Hey, man, come back.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Let's talk, 'cause now I have influence.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   I won't be influenced by you.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   I can influence you
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   and show you my God."
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Right?
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   That's ministry.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   That is what's ministry.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   And so resolve to change your playmates
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   and your playground.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   This next one's a big one.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   We're going to elaborate on this
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   over the next several weeks
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   through a new series called "Battle of the Sexes."
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   But number five, if you want to ruin your life,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   carelessly give your heart away.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   If you want to ruin your life,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   be careless with your heart.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Proverbs 4:23 says, "Above all else, guard your heart,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   for everything you do flows from it."
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   The reality of it is, is what you feed your heart
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   will determine who and how you love.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   What you put into your heart,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   what you give your heart,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   what you feed your heart
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   will determine who and how you love.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   And so feed your heart what is good.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Feed your heart the things of God.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   People seem so confused to me.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   When I sit with them, and they're like,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   "JP, man, I just don't get it.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Oh, I'm just attracted to terrible guys.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Man, I don't get it.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Like, the Lord just keeps putting me
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   in these awful relationships."
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   And I'm like, "No, he doesn't.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   You're feeding your heart trash."
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   And so, of course, you're going to go after those things.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   From what you watch on TV,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   what you look at on Pinterest,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   what you look at on the internet,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   or whatever that is for you,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   you're feeding your heart corruption.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Of course, it's going to chase those things.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   You're entertained by the very things Christ died for.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   That's what brings you entertainment,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   the very evil that Jesus gave his life for.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Of course, you're in dead-end relationship
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   after dead-end relationship
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   after dead-end relationship.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Try feeding your heart the Scriptures,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   living in the context of community,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   asking others, surrender to the Spirit for wisdom.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Don't cheapen your heart, which is very valuable,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   given and entrusted to you by God,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   indwelt by Christ.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Don't cheapen your heart by giving it away freely.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   I really believe, as I spend more time in the Scriptures,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   I really believe that God created you
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   to give your heart away once, one time,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   and that that would happen at the altar,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   that that would happen in a covenant before God.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   I know that's crazy today,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   but I just want you, if you don't believe me,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   just study the history of dating.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Study when these ideas are popularized.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Study the increase of divorce,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   the highest rate it's ever been.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Just study these things.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   I'm just coming at you with logic.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   I really believe the Lord God Almighty created you
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   to give your heart away one time to one person,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   and that he would already have their hearts,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   he would already have your heart,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   and so when you enter into that covenant with him,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   he meets you there,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   and there's what the Scripture calls a mingling of souls,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   something that can't be undone,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   something that's permanent,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   and so ladies, don't believe a guy
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   if he tells you he loves you,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   but his hand is moving towards anything
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   other than a ring box, all right?
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   And ladies, some of you,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   let me talk to you one more time,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   like some of you are here,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   and you're mourning a relationship
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   that never even happened, okay?
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Like you've given your heart away,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   little close to home,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   you've given your heart away,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   you've given your heart away to a guy
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   that doesn't even really know your name, right?
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Via Facebook or Pinterest or something else,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   and it's like you're mourning the breakup
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   of a relationship that never existed,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   and I'm challenging you on that.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Would you guard your heart, please?
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Would you stop letting your heart
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   chase after things that don't belong to you?
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   And gentlemen, gentlemen,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   would you have more depth and character
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   than to simply chase that which is simply pretty?
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Okay?
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   What is pretty today won't necessarily
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   be pretty tomorrow,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   and there are few things in life
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   worse than a contentious wife.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Okay?
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   I'm just telling you,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   there are a lot of beautiful people
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   in miserable marriages.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Miserable, miserable marriages.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And so would you just have some depth
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   and character and consider
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   how is this woman going to disciple my children?
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Like will she be a great disciple maker in the home?
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Would you consider some of these things
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   and look past just the charm and the beauty
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   which the scripture says is deceitful and fleeting?
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   And so resolve to be careful with your heart.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Proverbs 11, 22 says, I love this,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   "Like a gold ring in a pig's snout
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   "is a beautiful woman who shows no discretion."
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Yeah, ooh.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Resolve to be careful with your heart.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Resolve to be careful with your heart.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   I said too often we're entertained
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   by the very evil that Christ died for.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   That's number six.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   You want to ruin your life in your 20s,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   tolerate evil.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Tolerate evil.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   It's like a frog in water.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Like the temperature just gets hotter
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   and hotter and hotter around us.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   And before we know it,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   we're boiling in the very evil climate
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   that we were called to resist,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   but we didn't realize it because we tolerated it.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Let me show you from the scriptures.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Proverbs 8, verse 13 says,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   "To fear the Lord is to hate evil.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   "I hate pride and arrogance,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   "evil behavior and perverse speech."
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Proverbs 3, verse 7 says,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   "Do not be wise in your own eyes.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   "Fear the Lord and shun evil."
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Let me tell you like this.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   The only thing necessary for evil to prevail
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   is for good people to do nothing.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   The only thing necessary for evil to prevail
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   is for good people to do nothing.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   I don't know if you've watched the news lately,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   but it's getting crazy out there.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   And you were given gifts and talents to do good things.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Like tomorrow night, Luke was telling you,
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   like we're gonna talk about pushing back the darkness
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   on this idea of pornography, sex trafficking,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   the drug climate in our very own city,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   the prostitution that happens here in Dallas, Texas.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   What are you gonna do about it?
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   What are you gonna do about it?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Right?
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   It's getting mad out there.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   The other day I was reading the news.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   I couldn't believe what I was reading.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   It was this article about this fifth grade boy
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   who went to the women's restroom,
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   wanted the freedom to go in the girls' bathroom
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   because he felt like it.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   And a girl that stood up to him and said,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   "Hey, I don't wanna go to the bathroom with you,"
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   was accused of hate speech.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   I want you to hear,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   and I'm thinking about my own girls, you know?
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   I want you to hear me.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   I am all about doing everything in love.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Everything in love, consistently in love.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   And I know there's this huge message out there for tolerance,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   but you make sure that you don't buy into tolerating evil
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   and wicked things, okay?
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Because all of the sudden, you're going to raise your children
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   in a world that is consumed with evil.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   And God's solution is you.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   And God's solution is you.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   So resolve to stand against evil around you.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Resolve to stand against evil around you.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   Number seven, you want to ruin your lives in your 20s,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   make secondary things ultimate and ultimate things secondary.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Proverbs 30, verse 8 and 9 says this,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   "Keep falsehood and lies far from me."
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Now listen closely.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   "Give me neither poverty nor riches,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   "but give me only my daily bread, only what I need right now.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   "Otherwise I may have too much and disown you and say,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   "'Who is the Lord?'
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   "Or I may become poor and still and so dishonor the name of my God."
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Let me read it to you again.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Make secondary things ultimate and ultimate things secondary.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   This is a way to ruin your life.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   What the writer of that proverb is saying is,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   "May nothing in this whole entire world,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   "not even my appetite, not even my food intake,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   "not even my wealth or my poverty,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   "may nothing distract me from God Almighty."
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   And so if you want to leave here and you want to pray a prayer over your life,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   pray this one,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   "Lord, remove anything in my life that would distract me from you."
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   It's a really scary prayer.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   In fact, it causes you to audit those relationships
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   and that job and those things and that status and that stuff.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   "Lord, remove anything in my life that would distract me from you."
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Anything.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   "Search me, O God, and reveal in me my anxious ways.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   "For you know when I sit and when I stand."
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   You know everything.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   So let me say this.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   I don't know what you're involved in.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Probably lots of good things like working out, getting fit.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   That's a great thing. Resolve to be fit. Resolve to work out. It's good.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Your work.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   I hope Christians have a really strong work ethic.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   I hope Christians are some of the best employees out there.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   So your work, that's a good thing.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Your relationships, your boyfriend/girlfriend, great thing.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   I'm glad you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   as long as you're honoring God in that relationship.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   I hope it leads to marriage. I hope I get to do it.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Celebrate that with you.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Those are all good things.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Your hobbies.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Your sports.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   But here's the problem.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   If you know more about Russell Williams
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   than you do about Jeremiah, there's a problem.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Some of you are like, "Who's Jeremiah?"
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   He wrote a book. You should read it.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   If you know more about Pinterest
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   than you do about Ruth,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   we've got an issue.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Let's be honest. Your priorities are jacked up.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   God's not first. Let's just be honest.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Just say, "Hey God, I love you. I love you like second, third, or fourth."
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Just under Pinterest. Just like Pinterest and you, God.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   That's how I love you.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Just be honest about it.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Just shoot God straight. He deserves you to shoot Him straight.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   You want to ruin your life.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   You prioritize other things above God.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Matthew 6:33 says, "Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   and all these things will be added to you."
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   The first commandment, Jesus says,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   And the other is like it. Love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   We prioritize God and the things of God.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Christianity and the Bible is not just a good idea.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   You were raised in Dallas, the Bible Belt,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   so the culture says, "Be a cultural Christian."
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   It's just a good idea. Do what you want and go to the porch.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Live how you want and show up at church every now and then.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   That was never the intention. This was your life.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   The gospel was the road that you traveled on, the car that you traveled in,
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   the force that pushed you down that road.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   It was everything in your life.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   It changed you from the inside out.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   The gospel has always meant change.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   It has always meant new creation.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   That your sins went on Jesus Christ and He resurrected from the dead.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   And because you've trusted in that, you have new life, new desires.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   You want new things.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   You live for something greater than you.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   And so God is ultimate.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   And so resolve to keep God and the things of God above everything else.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Above all other things.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   2014 is your year.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   This is the time. I don't care if you tell me you've been a Christian your whole life.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   You haven't been, first of all.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   It happened at some point. I've read that.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   But I don't care if you've been a Christian for a long time.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   This is your year.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   To put God first and ultimate above all other things.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   You want to ruin your life. This one is a popular one.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Believe that this life is all about you.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   You want to ruin your life, number eight.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   Believe that this life is all about you.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Proverbs 16, 18, just as this famous verse that says,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before the fall."
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   See what happens when you believe that this life is about you.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   You begin to use people. People become strategies that you can use for your own personal advancement.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Let me tell you something. God was not created for you.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   You were created for God.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   And you will not experience life to the fullest until you live your life fully for Him.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   I get to see it all the time. I get to see that incredible.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   I have a front row seat for this life change of these young adults that come in and they're just lost in uptown.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   And they're living for the world. And they're living for Dallas and stuff and status.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   And they come in and the Holy Spirit just grabs their heart.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   And then all of a sudden they start to live for God.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   And they start to use all of their gifts and their talents.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   There's just this makeover that happens in their life.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   And their friends are like, "What has happened to you?"
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   "Man, I'm interested in that thing that changed you."
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   And this ministry is just born around them. It's incredible to see.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   It is incredible to see.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   This is not a movie all about you.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   This is not a movie and you're the star.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   This is a movie that started at the beginning of the beginning and will end at the end of the end.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   And it's all about God. And you have this tiny little cameo.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   And you're forgotten before the screen changes.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   There's been a lot that have gone before you and a lot that have gone after you.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   It's not about you.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   In fact, the only part of your life that matters is what you did with an eternal God.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   That's the truth.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   The other day we went to dinner.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   And Finley, my little now five-year-old, we walk into this Mexican restaurant.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   And there's these, oh man, what do you call them, pinatas.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   There's these pinatas all over, like hanging from the ceiling.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And I watched her and she kind of walked in curiously and she kind of looked around.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   And she's like, just her eyes get real big.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   And I don't know what she's thinking. I never know what she's thinking. She's crazy.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   But her eyes get real big.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   And she's like, Daddy.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   And I'm like, what baby girl?
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   And she goes, Daddy, how did they know my birthday was coming?
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   You know?
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   She thought that they had decorated for her, you know, for her birthday that was coming in a week.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   She's like, how did they know?
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   And it's cute when you're five.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   But like some of us, we move into situations where we're like, oh man.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Everything exists for me.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Everybody is at my disposal.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Everyone exists for my own personal advancement, my own personal pleasure, my own personal satisfaction.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   If I walk into a room, everyone's talking about me.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   And when you become ultimate in your life, you become dysfunctional.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   That's the truth.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   You become relationally dysfunctional.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   And so stop and start taking captive those thoughts, those conversations you're having in the car.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   You're replaying the tape and you're wondering what they're thinking about you and why did they say that
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   and why did he comment that way on my Facebook and I just keep thinking about it.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   And why can't I stop thinking about it?
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Just stop.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   It's not about you.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   God's doing something bigger than you.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   You're here for just a little while.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   And so with your everything, worship him.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   It's really all about him.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   And so resolve to give your life away.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   If you want to pray a prayer like John the Baptist where he says, "I pray that I would decrease and that you would increase,"
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   resolve to give your life away.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   How do you ruin your life in your 20s?
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Number nine, live for immediate gratification.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Live for immediate gratification.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Reject this idea of delayed gratification.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   Proverbs 21 verse 20 says this, "The wise store up choice food and olive oil.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   The wise are able to wait, but fools gulp theirs down.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Fools follow their appetite to destruction.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Fools take whatever they want in the moment."
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   And so the problem with that is most great things in life are worth waiting for.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Very few great things in life come to us quickly.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   And so you've got to ask yourself, "Do you want an amazing marriage or do you want an amazing night?"
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Because if you're constantly chasing amazing nights, amazing marriages probably is not available to you.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   That might not be an option for you.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   Why? Because you are becoming what you are training for right now.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   Esau gave up his birthright for a cup of soup because he was hungry.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   He followed his appetite and it cost him.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Would you learn to suppress your appetite for destruction?
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   Would you learn to stand strong and lean in God and depend on Him and withhold that which you want in a moment for something greater?
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Resolve to hold out for God's best.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   Resolve to hold out for God's best.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   And number 10, a great way to ruin your life.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   A fantastic way if you want to ruin your life in your 20s or 30s is to avoid accountability.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   Avoid accountability.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   I love this Proverbs. It's so straightforward. It says this,
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   "Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but whoever hates correction is stupid."
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   You've got to love God, right? I'll just break it down for you.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   And so the only reason that we avoid accountability is because we don't want to be corrected.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   We don't want to shine a light on our sins and have someone tell us that we should stop doing that which we want to do,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   that which we feel like doing, that which our appetite has taken us toward.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   We just want to go through life and continue to do.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   And we think that one day we're going to wake up and it's just going to be fixed.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   We think that one day that all of these actions that we have given ourselves to, they won't have consequences, these ideas.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   And the reality of it is you can't do any of this.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   This was a big do message. Do this, do this, don't do this, do this, don't do this.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   But do you remember the other two messages? If you don't, please catch up.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   If you don't remember those other two messages, you can't do anything.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   You strenuously contend with the power that Christ so powerfully works out in us.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   And so what is the right response? It's dependence.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   But as you depend on God, you need accountability. You need to plug into a church.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   If you are here and you think in 2014 that's going to be the year that I really follow Jesus, but I'm not going to join a church,
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   you're joking yourself. You are kidding yourself.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   That is a joke, man. And you think, "Wow, who needs to really be a part of the church?"
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   You know, it's me and God. It's a personal thing.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Study church history.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   That was never, ever, ever God the Creator's intentions.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   It was always that you would plug into a body and be a hand or a foot or an eye
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   and serve within that body and then be surrounded by other Christ followers.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   And you say, "Hey, follow Christ together." And you would confess sin to them in a James 5, 16 kind of way.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   And if they would restore you, then they would help you.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Let's just look back over real quick what we just have committed to doing.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   You think that you want to resolve to walk with God this year, to live below your means this year.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   You think that you want to starve addictions this year, to change your playmates and your playground this year,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   to be careful with your heart. This is the year, God. I'm going to stop giving my heart away.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   To stand against the evil around you this year, to prioritize the things of God above all other things
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   and to give your life away and to hold out, to wait for God's best.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   But you're going to do it alone? No, you won't do it alone.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   You won't do it alone. You can't do it alone. You will not succeed.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   We went out on the street and just asked a bunch of people their resolutions.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   And two things stood out to me. One, no one resolved to ruin their life.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   No one resolved towards anything that was negative.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Everyone says, "Man, I want great things for me."
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   But they all also had the wherewithal to know that they could not do it alone.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   Would you just watch this with me right now? Just watch this short video.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Hey, PORCH, it's Annetta. This is week three of resolutions.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   So I thought we should get a little man on the street perspective.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   My New Year's resolution is to get back into running.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   I really don't have one because people don't really go through with it.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   To quit smoking this year.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   I don't actually.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   No, I don't have one.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   To start painting more.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   To read the Bible daily.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   A road trip per month.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   I do not have one.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   It's really original, but probably to work out more.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Get healthy, lose weight, work out a little bit more.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Or did you have one last year?
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   My New Year's resolution last year was to learn a new type of dance.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   And I didn't do it.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   For the past three years I haven't had one, so I don't think I need one.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   To go to the gym and it didn't work.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   I don't think so. Just forget to make them.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   No.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   I did, working out, and it didn't last very long.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   It was to eat healthier, and no I did not.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   I did not.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   No, I shy away from New Year's resolutions.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   No, I tend to be more realistic and not set resolutions, so I don't disappoint myself.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   Not so much. I didn't keep it.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   What do you think helps people succeed in their resolutions?
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Definitely community.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   Having accountability.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   People around you that are going to help you stay on track and keep you focused.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   Definitely community.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Telling it to somebody else so they can keep you accountable.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Someone to hold you accountable.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   I probably did best when I had others right there next to me.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   So the two things to say, hey, I can't do it alone, right? I need help, right?
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   There's one more. There's a bonus in 11.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   If you want to ruin your life in your 20s, believe that this message is for someone else.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Believe that God made a mistake by having you here instead of them here.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   It's not for someone else. It's for you.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   I was talking to my friend a while ago, Chad, gold medalist.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   He was kind of walking me through the journey, and he said everything in his life had prepared him for those moments,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   those platforms, if you will, the walking onto the rink, sitting there as the guy says, "On your mark, get set."
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   He had been training his whole life for that moment.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   And in Torino in 2006, he got to come home.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   I mean, he was America's golden child.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   He got the gold, the silver, and the bronze, and all attention was on him.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   And so he trained for four more years for Vancouver 2010.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   And he went back to Vancouver 2010.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   All he wanted was another gold.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   Like there was all of this talk.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   He was picked the favorite, I believe, for two races.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   He was supposed to come back with two gold medals.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   And he didn't.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   He got one more silver and one more bronze.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   And we were chatting just before I walked down.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   And he said, "Man, but it didn't matter.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   Like everybody kept -- every news reporter shoved a microphone in my face and said, 'Are you disappointed?'"
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   "Are you disappointed?"
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   I'm like, "Disappointed? I mean, yeah, I guess I'm let down.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   But listen, I've got something greater."
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   Because two months before Vancouver, my friend Chad had placed his faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   And he began to live his life for something greater than a gold medal.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   And every moment in his life prior to that has brought him to a place where he was on his knees before an almighty creator God saying,
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   "You are God and I am not.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   And one day, much sooner than I think I'm going to be with you forever and ever and ever,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   would you please stretch my imagination beyond my own little world so that I can live my life for you."
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   So that today, the compilation of all of Chad's moments are training him for one moment where he would meet Jesus Christ face to face.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   He would say, "God, I'm not God, but you are.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   You are God."
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   And that's going to happen for each of you.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   For each of you.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   And all these little moments that we get to share together,
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   the only thing that really matters in them is what we do with that moment.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   What we do with Jesus.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   What we do with our belief about God.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   The fact that we're here learning from the scriptures right now.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   God, I pray that we would become less.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   That you would become more.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   Father, would you help us to resolve to live our lives fully and radically for you.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   God, would you help us to know you and to make you known.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   Lord, we just sing of your praises.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   We sing of who you are.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   Would you stir our souls and remind us.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Would your spirit work inside of us.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   And for those of my friends that are here that don't know you,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   would your spirit pursue and crack open their hearts and would you introduce yourself to them.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   I sat down and David goes, JP, it's Russell Wilson.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   I said, hey, bro, I know Jeremiah, man.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   What do I need to know about Russell Wilson, you know.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   What do I know about Russell Wilson.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   I know he knows my Jesus.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   I read that.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   I read that.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Some of you here don't.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   I know you wake me up at night.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   I know God is sovereign.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   I do, but I know that he's no accident that you're here.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   And let's not talk about ruining your life.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   Let's talk about ruining your afterlife.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   Your life after life.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   He's provided a way.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Nothing.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   But trust in him.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   Let his spirit do the rest.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   I mean you came into this place.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   You've done some terrible things.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   I understand that's the terrible things you've done.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   It's just the fact that you think that you're good enough.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   You're not.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   He sent his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Truly he walked this earth.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   The most polarizing character in the history of the world.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   His book is bestseller year after year.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   And also in the history of the world.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   He split time in half.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   2014 years ago by showing up on the scene.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   A baby in a manger.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   Came to die.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   So that everything that you've done.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   Every bad relationship that you've pursued.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   Every stupid thing you've said.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   All the idols that you've worshipped.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   He was like I love her too much.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   I love him too much.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Put that on me God.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   Father you put those things on me.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   I will die in their place so that they can be with you forever.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   You want to ruin your life after life?
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   You reject that.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   Reject that.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   Pray that you wouldn't.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   I pray you trust in it.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   That you give your life to it and that you'd live for it.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   Amen.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
