[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120]   - Well, good morning, Awaken.
[00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.160]   How we doing today?
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.280]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.560]   All right.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.360]   Hey, my name is Timothy Atik,
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.840]   and I'm one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.920]   And prior to being here at Watermark,
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.600]   I was the director of a ministry called Breakway Ministries
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.800]   on the campus of Texas A&M.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.080]   Sounds like we've got some Aggies here, which is awesome.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.080]   And I'm just so glad to get to be here with you today.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.680]   What you need to know is I spend a lot of time writing.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.160]   Like I write sermons for a living,
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.400]   which means I do a lot of work in my home office.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.800]   And in my home office, I have two bookshelves
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.600]   that just sit in front of me all day, every day.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.120]   Now we moved from College Station to Dallas back in January.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.320]   And when we moved, there were certain things
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.000]   that we just put down, and over time,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.880]   that became those things home.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.040]   Like we never intended for those certain objects
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.320]   to live in those particular places,
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.040]   but over time, they just kind of made themselves at home,
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.320]   even though that's not where they belong.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.280]   And so I just thought I would kind of share with you,
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.840]   as I was preparing for this message,
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.120]   I looked at those two bookshelves,
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.800]   and my eyes were opened, and I realized
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.400]   that there were things on the shelf
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.880]   that had been there for a long time
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.120]   that didn't actually belong.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.240]   Like that's where my lint roller is.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.240]   Like it's on my bookcase, that's where I keep my lint roller.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.200]   And there's a fishing license,
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.640]   and you're like, "Ah, he must be a fisher."
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.480]   I'm not.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.160]   This was, my father-in-law wanted to take my kids fishing,
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.840]   so I bought, this is the only fishing license
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.840]   I've ever bought in my life, probably the last one
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.640]   I'll ever buy, but this particular fishing license
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.480]   lives on my bookshelf.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.000]   This is an iPhone 6, it's heading to a museum tomorrow,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   but this has been living on my bookshelf for four months.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.560]   This is a used up Amazon gift card that's been there,
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.440]   and then this is the, this is the,
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.000]   you ever go to the Cracker Barrel,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.560]   and there's that golf tee game?
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.560]   Do you know what I'm talking about?
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.080]   Well, this is the instructions for how to beat that game.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.440]   And I have had it on my bookshelf for months,
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.440]   and this is a grocery sack of my ties,
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.080]   'cause I don't wear ties.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.560]   The only time I wear a tie is when I'm officiating
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.000]   a wedding or officiating a funeral,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.560]   and I wear the same tie every time.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.920]   So these are just the ties that I've accumulated
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.680]   over the years that made the move
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.520]   and landed on my bookshelf.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.840]   And some of you see that, and you don't get it.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.880]   You're like, I don't understand how you live,
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.800]   because you're a neat freak,
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.960]   and so everything that you own has its place,
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.840]   and if it's no longer in its place, you get restless.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.080]   Others of you, you get it.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.880]   Like, I just wanna challenge you.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.800]   Go and get in your car and just look around.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.120]   Like, open up your console, open up your trunk,
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.320]   look in your back seat, snap a picture, tag Awaken.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.320]   Let's see what has found a place in your car
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.960]   that's not where it belongs, but that's now where it lives.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.080]   Or go look in your apartment.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.760]   Just look around your room.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.600]   Other people would come and be like,
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.000]   why is there a hockey stick in your kitchen?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.560]   You're like, that's where it lives.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.040]   Like, that's just where it goes.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.360]   That's our tendency, whether you realize it or not.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.560]   There's certain things in your life,
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.480]   certain objects where you live
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.280]   that have kind of found a home,
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.800]   even though that's not where they belong.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.240]   The reason I tell you that is because this morning,
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.000]   we're gonna look at a story in the Scriptures
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.560]   where Jesus is going to step into the house of God,
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.680]   and he's going to find some things
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.280]   that have made themselves at home,
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.400]   but that's really not where they belong,
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.520]   and he's going to do something about it.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.760]   And the reason that I want us to look at this story
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.560]   is that it's just going to prompt us
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.240]   to have a really honest conversation.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.360]   It's going to require each one of us
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.000]   to just look at the places where we worship.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.800]   I hope that you, I hope that there is a local church
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.560]   wherever you live, I hope that there is a place
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.120]   where you go that you would call your church home.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.280]   And if not, no shame there,
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.960]   but hey, that is one of your to-dos when you leave awakened.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.960]   But this is going to require us to just look at
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.480]   maybe the places where we call home for church
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.880]   or the places where we go to worship.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.520]   It's just going to prompt us to evaluate,
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.960]   hey, have some things moved in
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.960]   and made themselves at home in those places
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.960]   that don't belong?
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.400]   But then it's gonna require us to look inwardly
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.680]   and ask the question, hey, are there some things
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.160]   that have made themselves at home in my life
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.320]   or in my soul that just don't belong?
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.360]   See, the whole goal of this message
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.160]   is to move us towards health.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.960]   Health as we worship together
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.000]   and health just as we live.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.880]   Like if we want our churches
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.880]   to have their best days ahead with Jesus
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.560]   and if we individually want to have our best days ahead
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.080]   with Jesus, then we have to develop eyes
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.760]   to see the things in our worlds
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.600]   that have moved in and made themselves at home,
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.800]   but they just don't belong there.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.840]   So if you have a Bible, I want you to turn with me
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.960]   this morning to John chapter two.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.960]   John chapter two is where we are going to be today.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:05.200]   John chapter two, this is a story about Jesus Christ
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.960]   stepping into the house of God, the temple,
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.040]   and cleansing it.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.200]   It says this in John chapter two, verse 13.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.080]   It says the Passover of the Jews was at hand
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.400]   and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   In the temple, he found those who were selling oxen
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.520]   and sheep and pigeons and the money changers sitting there
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.760]   and making a whip of cords, he drove them all out
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.560]   of the temple with the sheep and oxen
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.160]   and he poured out the coins of the money changers
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.000]   and overturned their tables and he told those
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.040]   who sold the pigeons, take these things away.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.040]   Do not make my father's house a house of trade.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.720]   His disciples remembered that it was written,
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.320]   zeal for your house will consume me.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.520]   So all eyes on me.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.840]   This is a story where if you've seen Dude Perfect
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.560]   and you're familiar with the rage monster,
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.560]   Jesus goes rage monster in the temple.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.680]   And the reason that that's important is because
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.680]   what we see is Jesus expressing deep passion and emotion.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.920]   Anytime you read the scriptures, here's my encouragement.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.840]   Anytime you open up this book and you read
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.440]   that Jesus shows some strong emotion, take note
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.440]   because you're observing what he cares about most.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:31.440]   So anytime you see him show really extreme passion
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.520]   or extreme compassion for people or when he's impressed
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.560]   by someone's faith or he's very angry, take note
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.760]   because that's what he cares about and we wanna care
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.360]   about what Jesus cares about.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.200]   This is a story about Jesus cleansing the temple.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.880]   So here's where I wanna start, okay, and follow me on this.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.200]   But where I want to start today is with this reality.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.200]   Don't miss it.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   Jesus cares deeply about the temple and so should Brie.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.600]   Okay, that's where I wanna start.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.200]   Jesus cares deeply about the temple and so should we.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.960]   And when you hear that, that might hit you in a weird way
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.940]   because when you think about the temple,
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.080]   you think about like church for Jews.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.800]   And if you're familiar with the Bible
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.960]   and you're familiar with the temple,
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.720]   then you know that the temple was a structure
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.080]   in the city of Jerusalem that doesn't even stand anymore.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.000]   So for me to say Jesus cares deeply about the temple
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.040]   and so should we, there might be a disconnect there,
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.400]   but here's what you need to understand, okay.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   That the temple of God is not just a reference
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.000]   to a building that Jews worshiped at, okay.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.240]   When you think temple, what I want you to think
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.760]   is presence of God.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.920]   Because when you look and you read the scriptures,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.760]   the temple of God was the main way that God declared
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.720]   to his people, I'm here.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.960]   So the first temple in the Bible
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.040]   was actually the Garden of Eden.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.240]   The Garden of Eden was considered the garden temple
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.080]   and God walked with Adam and Eve.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.360]   So the Garden of Eden was God's declaration, I'm here.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.840]   And then God led the nation of Israel
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.520]   out of captivity to Egypt.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.480]   And as they're wandering in the wilderness,
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.080]   he instructs the leaders to erect a tabernacle,
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.440]   which was a temporary dwelling place for God,
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.320]   Exodus 25, eight says, let them make me a sanctuary.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.680]   That's a reference to the tabernacle, why?
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.320]   That I may dwell in their mix.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.200]   So the tabernacle was a declaration from God, I'm here.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.960]   And then the nation of Israel made its way
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.880]   into the promised land and King Solomon
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.560]   built a permanent tabernacle known as the temple
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.760]   and the presence of God filled the temple
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.920]   and God declared to his people, I'm here.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.680]   So when you hear me say that Jesus cares deeply
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.000]   about the temple and so should we,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   I want you to connect temple with presence of God.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Jesus refers to the temple as a house of prayer
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.720]   for all nations and so the temple was to be a place
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.600]   where people could come and meet with the God
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.400]   who was present in their midst, okay?
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.840]   So that's the background on temple.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.040]   Now let's look at the story
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.720]   and I just want you to see what happens.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.320]   Look again at verse 13, it says,
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.000]   the Passover of the Jews was at hand
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.120]   and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, okay?
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.720]   So Jerusalem was the city where the temple resided.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.720]   To go to Jerusalem was to go to the city where God lives.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.000]   Passover was basically, the Jewish people
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.080]   had a bunch of parties on their calendar.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.000]   Like they did a lot of celebrating
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.920]   and the Passover was the most significant celebration
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.720]   where the entire nation would come together
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.800]   to reflect on and remember what God had done
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.800]   in rescuing them out of Egypt, slavery to Egypt.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.120]   And so the population of Jerusalem at Passover
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.840]   would swell to like 250,000 people.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.240]   So it's kind of like awaken.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.600]   You had people from all over the Roman Empire
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.560]   coming to one city to meet with God.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.000]   So just imagine there's 250,000 people,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.260]   they're coming from everywhere and what are they doing?
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.280]   They are coming to the temple.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.680]   They are coming to the house of God,
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.660]   the place where the presence of God is said to reside.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.520]   The place that is referred to
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.160]   as a house of prayer for all nations.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.920]   And so the expectation is that all these hundreds
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.960]   of thousands of people are going to come
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.720]   and experience a spiritual high.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.240]   It's like awaken, all the young adults in Israel
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.480]   are gonna leave saying, oh, I was wrecked.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.960]   Like God wrecked me in the best of ways.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.960]   And it's just like this moment in their trajectory
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.480]   with God where they're saying, that was it.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.640]   That was the moment I was just weeping
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.820]   and the spirit of God met me and I'm never gonna sin again.
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.480]   Like that's what you expect as these hundreds of thousands
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.080]   of people come to Passover to worship.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.720]   But here's what it says in verse 14.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.880]   It says, "In the temple, he," that's Jesus,
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.280]   "he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.920]   "and the money changers sitting there."
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.480]   Now, let me tell you what's going on here, okay?
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.000]   In the temple, there's people who are selling animals.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.360]   Why are they selling animals?
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.560]   They're selling animals because when people
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.000]   come to the temple at Passover,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.800]   they come planning to sacrifice an animal
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.800]   as an act of worship to God.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.560]   And so the reason that there were people selling
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.560]   pigeons or lambs was so that people didn't have to drag
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.360]   their lamb across the Roman Empire to the temple.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.520]   They didn't have to like carry their pigeons
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.240]   all the way across a country just to get to Jerusalem.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.680]   No, they could come and it was already there.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.360]   And the reason that there were money changers
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.360]   is because every Jewish male 20 years or older
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.740]   was required to offer a temple tax.
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.880]   And it had to be one specific currency.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.360]   But there were people coming from all over
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.700]   the Roman Empire, so there were different currencies.
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.440]   And so they would have money changers there
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.760]   just to help people and make it easier for people
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.280]   to get the right currency to make their payment.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.960]   Jesus isn't happy about it.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.920]   Here's what it says in verses 15 and 16.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.920]   It says, "And making a whip of cords."
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.200]   I find that hilarious.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.080]   Like, Jesus just makes an impromptu whip.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.520]   Like, I don't know if you've ever been in that moment
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.000]   where you're like, "You know what I need right now?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   "I need a whip."
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.960]   (imitates whip)
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.040]   Just wait till I'm done making my whip.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.400]   Like, you'll just see what happens.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.280]   Like, it's fascinating to me that he's like,
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.120]   "You know what?
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.280]   "I don't have a whip, but I can make a whip."
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.060]   And he does.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.240]   And what does he do with the whip?
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.880]   It says, "He drove them all out of the temple
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.640]   "with the sheep and oxen, and he poured out the coins
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.260]   "of the money changers and overturned their tables.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.180]   "And he told those who sold the pigeons,
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.320]   "Take these things away.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.000]   "Do not make my Father's house a house of trade."
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.520]   Why is Jesus so upset?
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.680]   Is it because of what they're doing?
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.680]   Selling animals?
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.240]   Changing currency?
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.080]   No.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.320]   Those were okay things.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.400]   It was okay for them to think about
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.920]   how to make sacrificing animals to God easier on people.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.560]   It was okay for them to think about changing money
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.560]   to make it more convenient for people.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.720]   The issue wasn't what they were doing.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.200]   The issue is where they were doing it.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.360]   They were doing it in the middle of the house of God,
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.000]   which was to be the place where people
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.280]   were to come and meet with God.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.080]   Let me ask you, show of hands,
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.520]   anyone here ever had their quiet time
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.860]   at a Walmart on Good Friday?
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:32.920]   No?
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.400]   Why not?
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.560]   Anyone ever done it at a petting zoo,
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.320]   like just pulled out your Bible and met with God
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.520]   in the middle of a petting zoo?
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.800]   I wonder why.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:48.160]   'Cause it's not the most conducive place to meet with God.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.560]   D.A. Carson,
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.240]   scholar who wrote the leading commentary
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.080]   on the Gospel of John says this.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.840]   He said, "Instead of solemn dignity
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.120]   "in the murmur of prayer,
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.640]   "there is the bellowing of cattle and the bleeding of sheep.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.320]   "Instead of brokenness, incantation,
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.600]   "holy adoration, and prolonged petition,
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.320]   "there is noisy commerce."
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.680]   Do you see what the priority was?
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.360]   Among the leaders in the temple,
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.360]   the priority was on convenience and attendance.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.320]   That's what the priority was on.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.900]   The priority was on convenience.
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.120]   Let's just make it as easy as possible
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.200]   for people to get here and do what they need to do for God.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.400]   And the priority was on attendance.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.520]   At least they're here.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.360]   Let's just get them here.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.080]   But the priority was not on God's presence.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.720]   In fact, the presence of God at this point
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.040]   in Israel's history,
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.960]   the presence of God had departed from the temple
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.680]   and it was just business as usual.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.760]   And that's deeply concerning.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.400]   May that never be true of our churches,
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.480]   that the presence of God has departed
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.360]   and it's just business as usual on a Sunday.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.400]   So what does Jesus do?
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.240]   He cleans house.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.760]   He gets rid of everything that doesn't belong,
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.240]   everything that would hinder or distract worshipers
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.840]   from truly worshiping.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.660]   Now, remember where we started.
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.260]   Remember what the truth was where we started.
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.600]   We said Jesus cares deeply about the temple
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.940]   and so should we.
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.440]   So if you're tracking along,
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.840]   then it would be okay for you to be thinking right now,
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.040]   okay, I understand that Jesus cares deeply
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:36.880]   about the temple.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.340]   That's why he drove all the sheep and pigeons out,
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:44.340]   but I still don't understand what it looks like for me
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.760]   to care about the temple.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.360]   Okay, well, keep tracking with me.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.440]   'Cause Jesus now has a conversation
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.840]   which is going to draw the relevance
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.760]   of this passage closer for us.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.840]   Verse 18.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.960]   It says, "So the Jews said to him,
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:06.960]   "what sign do you show us for doing these things?"
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.920]   What sign do you show us for doing these things?
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.240]   It's interesting that they don't say, how dare you?
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.680]   They say, hey, who told you
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.120]   that you have the authority to do this?
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.400]   Because they might be realizing
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.440]   that they're doing something that they shouldn't be doing.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.740]   So they're not saying, how dare you?
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.200]   They're saying, hey, who are you?
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.400]   And do you have the authority to be doing what you're doing?
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.000]   Here's how Jesus answered them.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.160]   He said, "Destroy this temple,
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.520]   "and in three days, I will raise it up."
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.740]   The Jews then said, "It's taken 46 years
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.440]   "to build this temple, and will you raise it up
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.280]   "in three days?"
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:48.280]   But he, Jesus, was speaking about the temple of his body.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:53.940]   "When therefore he was raised from the dead,
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.020]   "his disciples remembered that he had said this,
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.160]   "and they believed the scripture
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.040]   "and the word that Jesus had spoken."
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.160]   So this interaction that Jesus has is very eye-opening,
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.240]   because what Jesus is trying to declare to the Jews
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:14.240]   is the temple is transitioning from a building to a body.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.480]   And the Jews don't get it.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.000]   They still think that he's talking
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.240]   about a physical structure, the building,
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.840]   but Jesus is talking about his body
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.080]   is now the temple of God.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:32.080]   And Jesus references his death, burial, and resurrection.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.720]   "Destroy this body, that will be Jesus hanging on the cross,
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.440]   "and it will be raised in three days."
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.320]   That's a reference to his resurrection.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.120]   The reason that that is so important
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.060]   is because the imagery makes a deep connection.
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.880]   See, the physical temple, the building,
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.420]   was the place where once a year,
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.000]   a high priest would enter a very special room
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.200]   inside of the temple known as the Holy of Holies.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.560]   Only that one person was allowed
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.760]   to enter that room one time a year,
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.720]   and he would wear a rope around his ankles
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.000]   in case he died in the presence of God.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.680]   People could pull him out
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.080]   without having to go in after him.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.080]   Once a year, that person, the high priest,
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.600]   would enter the Holy of Holies
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:19.160]   and sprinkle the blood of an animal on the altar
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.960]   to make atonement for the sins of Israel.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.760]   Jesus says, "My body is the temple."
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:28.160]   It's no longer the blood of an animal
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.040]   that makes atonement for the sins of Israel.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.840]   It will be my blood,
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.160]   which makes provision for the sins of the world.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.440]   It's no longer a high priest, once a year,
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.520]   doing something to make the nation of Israel right with God.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.160]   It is me, Jesus, doing something once and for all
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.680]   that will make right all those
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.280]   who have put their faith in me with God.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.240]   Jesus says the temple has transitioned
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.680]   from a building to a body.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.160]   Now, if you're tracking along,
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.240]   again, the question you should be asking is,
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.840]   okay, Jesus cares deeply about the temple,
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.880]   in TA, that's what people call me.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.640]   You're telling me I should care deeply about the temple.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.560]   I now understand that the temple
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.800]   is not a building but a body,
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.640]   but Jesus Christ, after he rose from the dead,
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.840]   he ascended into heaven,
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.040]   where he's now seated at the right hand of the Father.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.560]   So he's no longer even on earth.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.520]   So what does it look like for me to value the temple?
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.080]   Here it is.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:37.520]   First Corinthians chapter three, verse 16.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.040]   Listen to what it says.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:45.320]   Or do you not know that you are God's temple
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:52.440]   in that God's spirit dwells in you?
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.360]   If anyone destroys God's temple,
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:59.360]   God will destroy him for God's temple is holy
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.160]   and you are that temple.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.280]   So now we're making a connection
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.400]   because the temple went from a building
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.680]   to the body of Jesus,
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.640]   but then Jesus Christ rose from the dead
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.480]   and ascended into heaven, ascended into heaven,
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.480]   and then Jesus Christ sent his spirit to the earth
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.400]   and the spirit of God now takes up residence
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.720]   in the people of God.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.720]   And what's interesting is that when Paul says,
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.840]   you are the temple of God,
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.540]   that word you in the Greek is in the plural.
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:34.120]   So this is a reference to the people of God,
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.200]   the universal church,
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.500]   anyone who would consider themselves
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.440]   a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.160]   we collectively, the people of God,
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.720]   are now the temple of God.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.840]   We, the people of God,
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.480]   are the way that God declares, I'm here.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.200]   And the greatest way that the temple of God
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.400]   is manifested on the earth today
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.200]   is through local expressions, local churches.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.800]   That's why it's so important
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.840]   for you to be connected to a local church
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.680]   wherever you live,
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.800]   because that is the greatest expression
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.200]   of the temple of God.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:16.480]   The temple of God is how God now declares on the earth,
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.600]   I'm here.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:23.680]   So now the question that is good for us to answer
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:28.480]   is like if Jesus were to step in to awaken right now,
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.560]   or if he were to step into your church
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.000]   on a Sunday morning,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   would Jesus step in and look at what we're doing?
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.480]   Would he look at how we're worshiping?
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.280]   Would he look at how we're studying the word?
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.800]   Not just here at Awaken,
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.040]   but wherever you find a place to worship,
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.840]   would Jesus step into that moment and be like,
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.920]   that's what I'm talking about.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.160]   Like when I thought about my people gathering to worship,
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.000]   like this is what I envision.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.400]   Or would he see things
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.560]   that he would want to drive out?
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.120]   Like are there things in our churches,
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.800]   are there things even here at Awaken, I don't know,
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.320]   that have kind of found themselves
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.480]   on the bookshelves of our churches
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.920]   and have made themselves at home?
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.440]   See, we have to understand the reason
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.720]   that we should care deeply about the temple
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:30.280]   is because we are the temple collectively.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.200]   We are.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.880]   We are the temple of God collectively.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.400]   That's who we are.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.120]   So it's just good for us to evaluate,
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:41.040]   is there anything that Jesus would want to drive out?
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.560]   I just want to identify some things
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.240]   that I see going on in the church today
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.720]   that we just need to be careful of
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.000]   because if we aren't careful,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.320]   you know what we are going to do?
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.880]   We are going to prioritize what the leaders in the temple
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.760]   in the first century prioritized.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.640]   Like if we're not careful,
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.080]   we will have a tendency to prioritize convenience
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.440]   over God's presence.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.320]   Do you ever feel that when you go to worship?
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.560]   Do you ever prioritize convenience?
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.040]   Like I see this, I used to work with college students
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.760]   at A&M and I would see this tendency towards,
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.240]   you know what, I'll go to church when I can go,
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.520]   but you know what, I'm super busy.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.240]   And you know what, I had a late Saturday night
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.080]   and I need to get a jump on my work for the week.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:31.080]   And so I will get more serious about gathering
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.000]   with God's people at a later time,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.160]   but right now I'll just, I'll go when I can go.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.120]   So I don't know if that connects with you at all,
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.560]   but there can be this tendency of, you know what,
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.880]   I'll go when I'm in town and I'll go when I can,
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.520]   but you know what, if I can't go,
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.400]   here's the thing that I'm most worried about
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.040]   for the next generation.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:56.040]   It is the belief that live streaming or podcasting
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:01.400]   is a great substitute for gathering with God's people.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.800]   And I'm just telling you,
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.520]   we collectively are the temple of God.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.760]   It is us gathering together,
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:16.760]   that when we gather together, God is declaring, I am here.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.560]   When you are in your apartment alone or in your car
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:25.440]   podcasting at double speed, that that is a disconnect.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.920]   It's a disconnect.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.800]   The priority there is on, it's on convenience.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.520]   It's not on God's presence.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:40.520]   Or like this, you know,
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:45.280]   people are talking about Generation Z's attention span.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.200]   It's like a big topic of conversation
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.960]   that Generation Z's attention span is down to eight seconds,
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.040]   which is shorter than a goldfish.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.840]   And so what's the responsibility of the church?
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.680]   Well, we need to, we need to make everything shorter.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.600]   We need to have shorter services and shorter worship sets
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.960]   and shorter sermons.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.800]   Why?
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.040]   So we don't lose people's attention.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:12.440]   And I'm like, what are we doing here?
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:16.880]   It's all about convenience.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:22.760]   It's all about us making things as palatable as possible.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:26.880]   Or there's this movement towards
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.320]   just making the Bible simpler
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.360]   because biblical illiteracy is at an all time high.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.800]   People don't know their Bibles.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.920]   And so you know what is happening
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.040]   is pastors are giving people less Bible
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.880]   because they don't think that they can handle it.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.920]   And so what you see pastors doing,
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.080]   and this is not me railing against pastors.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.960]   This is me saying, hey, if you are a pastor,
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.800]   hey, we've got to hold the line.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.640]   Because there's this tendency,
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.520]   and I can slip into it as well, where it's like,
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.600]   okay, let's just give people one verse.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.560]   Like let's read the Bible for 30 seconds
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.080]   and then let's hold a pep rally for 10 to 15 minutes
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.240]   where I will just tell you my opinions
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.320]   and get you hyped up on Jesus for the next 15 minutes.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.280]   But that's really just me saying,
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:17.280]   hey, you're great and go do good things and God loves you.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.360]   And what is happening is that people's spiritual stomachs
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.880]   are shrinking down to the point
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.600]   where they can only handle spiritual milk
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.600]   when the word of God is like a, it's an incredible filet.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.640]   And if you're a vegetarian,
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.920]   that doesn't connect with you at all.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:43.360]   And I apologize deeply,
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.260]   but it's time to get back on the meat.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:52.140]   But do you see what I'm talking about?
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.260]   There's a priority on convenience over God's presence.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.240]   And hey, that's not me trying to condemn.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.080]   That's just me saying, look, I see where we're headed.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.200]   And if we're not careful,
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.600]   we're gonna prioritize the things
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.500]   that were prioritized in the first century.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.880]   Our tendency will be to prioritize attendance
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.080]   over God's presence.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.880]   Like I'll tell you the temptation for me as a leader.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.360]   My tendency can be to look at this room.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:23.360]   I mean, if you look around, there's 3,500 plus people in here
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.960]   I can snap a picture of this and show it to people
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.120]   and be like, you wanna see what happened at Awaken?
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.560]   Here's it, this is it.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.440]   But attendance only tells you how many people in the room.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.200]   It doesn't tell you if the spirit of God moved or not.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.760]   And so ministry leaders, we have to be careful
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:47.760]   not to celebrate big numbers when there's little movement.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.360]   And so I just tell you that to say that that is a disconnect
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.720]   that if we aren't careful, we'll be prioritizing
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.200]   the same thing that was prioritized in the first century.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.240]   But then we have to make sure
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.320]   that we don't just prioritize attendance over God's presence
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.760]   that it's like, you know what?
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.440]   When you show up to worship, you're kind of flying in high,
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.160]   you're already 10 to 15 minutes late,
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.480]   but you haven't had your coffee yet.
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.640]   And so worship's going on,
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.040]   but it's like, I gotta get my coffee.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.960]   And then you get in, you sit down,
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.240]   you start texting your friends
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.600]   to find out where they're sitting.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.620]   And then there's like a song left.
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.240]   And so then you just go on autopilot worship
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.920]   where you're singing all the words,
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.360]   but your mind is somewhere else.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.600]   It's like, way maker, okay, I need to text him back.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.760]   Miracle worker, oh my gosh,
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.800]   Cain's is gonna sound so good after church today.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.080]   Promise, and it's like you're autopilot worship.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.840]   But our tendency is to just, you know what?
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.040]   At least I was there.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.800]   But if you look at this story, you know what we see?
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.720]   We see that Jesus despises attendance without worship.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.560]   Like God doesn't sit in him and say,
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.900]   but at least they're there.
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.440]   They don't give a rip about being there,
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.040]   but at least they're in the building.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:04.960]   No, that's not what is pleasing to him.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.880]   And then I'll just give you a third thing
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.680]   that we can tend to prioritize
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.680]   is preference over God's presence.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:17.080]   Like I see this, I saw this with college students.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.400]   There was this tendency to shop and hop
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.200]   when it came to church.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.160]   And if you find one thing that you don't like, you leave.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.320]   And then there's this movement now
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.400]   to make celebrities out of pastors and worship leaders
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.240]   to where we get to the point that we only really like
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.640]   learning from certain people.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.360]   Like I remember one guy saying,
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:42.960]   "Nobody speaks to me like this one person."
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.040]   And I was like, man, I hate that for you.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.240]   I hate that for you.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:53.560]   Because now your mind and heart are only truly fully open
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.560]   to receive from the word of God
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.960]   when this one person is speaking.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:01.040]   But God has called countless people
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.160]   to teach the word of God.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.280]   And every single one of us is called to open up this word
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:11.000]   in any time it's taught, to listen and receive
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.480]   as if God is speaking to us.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.440]   And this is a tough conversation.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.680]   Like I don't wanna be the get off my lawn guy.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.640]   Like I don't feel like I'm at that point in my life yet.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.840]   I know I'm older than you, but I'm only 41.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.280]   Like I don't feel like, so if it feels like that,
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.920]   I apologize, but I just, this is me just in my love
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.360]   for the church and for you wanting to say,
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.640]   hey, please, let's guard against this.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.400]   I see this tendency towards critiquing
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.680]   instead of worshiping.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.680]   Like be careful.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.800]   Do you ever leave church and ask the question,
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.360]   what did you think?
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.560]   That's a critiquing question.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:53.640]   The only answer is either you liked it or you didn't.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.160]   It's the wrong question to ask.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.600]   The right question to ask is,
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.400]   hey, what did God say to you today?
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.440]   Like if God is there, if God is here,
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.040]   then what is he saying to you?
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.280]   So here's my point.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.880]   The reason that we should care about the temple
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.600]   is that we are the temple collectively
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:15.080]   when we gather together, we can confidently declare
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.560]   God is, he's here.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:23.560]   Can you imagine, like if you want to be a change agent,
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.360]   if you want to be a change agent,
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:31.120]   then when you go home, go to your local church,
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.920]   and when you walk into that place,
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.560]   you walk in with the conviction,
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.160]   God is here and I'm going to meet with him.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.000]   And just watch how things begin to change.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.480]   Like if a group of you gets together
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.960]   and you go into your church and you believe God is here
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.280]   and we are going to meet with him,
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.560]   just watch how things will change.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.720]   It will be infectious, it will be contagious.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.080]   You will begin to see people find healing
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.960]   from brokenness that comes from sin.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.400]   You will see people feel called
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.520]   to take the gospel to the nations.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:05.440]   You will see people finally begin to enjoy
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.000]   relating to Jesus.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.520]   You will see people serving the church wholeheartedly
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.040]   with their time, with their talent, with their treasure.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:18.000]   And it'll be a beautiful thing.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.120]   We are the temple collectively,
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.560]   but we can't just stop there
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.720]   because here's what 1 Corinthians 6 says,
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.840]   and I hope you're ready to hear it.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:30.440]   It says this, "Or do you not know that your body
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you,
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.840]   whom you have from God?
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.080]   You individually are not your own,
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.680]   for you are bought with a price.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.400]   So glorify God in your body."
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.640]   Here's what that means.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.880]   We're not just the temple collectively.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:54.320]   You are the temple of God individually.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.560]   Have you ever had that realization
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.840]   that when you put your trust in Jesus Christ,
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:04.880]   the Spirit of God actually comes and lives inside of you
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:09.760]   so that now you, your body, your soul is a home,
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.120]   it is a house for the living God?
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:18.520]   1 Corinthians 6, when it says, "Your body is a temple,"
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:22.080]   that word temple there, in the Greek,
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.200]   it means the sacred shrine, the sanctuary,
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.000]   the place where deity dwells.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.840]   Is that how you think about your body?
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.640]   The place where deity dwells because that's what it is.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.640]   It's the house of the living God.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.440]   So the question that we need to answer individually is this.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.960]   Like if Jesus were to spend the day with us,
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.720]   which he actually does every day, all day,
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.440]   but if we were aware of it,
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.760]   if he were to spend a day with us,
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.560]   is there anything that in your life or in my life
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.800]   that Jesus would look at and say,
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.160]   "Hey, look, this has nothing to do
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.280]   with my unconditional love for you."
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:03.200]   I love you, but there are things in your life
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.560]   that have made themselves at home in the house of God
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:09.080]   that no longer belong.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.920]   Like is there anything in your life right now
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.440]   that Jesus would look at and say,
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:17.520]   "Look, you got a fishing license in your soul
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.360]   that it doesn't make sense anymore.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.000]   It doesn't fit."
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.440]   I'll explain it this way.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:31.960]   There is a major difference between renting a home
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.000]   and owning a home, and we've done both.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.480]   Right now, we're renting.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:42.280]   And the deal with renting is that you get to live there,
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.160]   but you have no freedom or authority
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.880]   to do what you want with the house.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.840]   So right now, we're living in a home
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.720]   where the floor plan is what it is.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:56.360]   The wallpaper on the walls, it is what it is.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.200]   The paint color, it is what it is.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.760]   We've done the best we can with the place that isn't,
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.800]   it isn't ours.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:07.600]   But then I know what it's like to own a home.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.480]   And my wife has watched enough HGTV
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:14.680]   that she knows exactly how to make that home her own.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.480]   And we're about to move into a house
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.000]   in less than a month that we're gonna own it.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.520]   And my wife has been going over to that house
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.640]   constantly, measuring stuff, checking stuff out,
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.720]   because she knows exactly what she's going to do
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.440]   in the house that she will have complete freedom
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.560]   and complete authority to do with it what she wants.
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:37.280]   So there's a big difference between renting and owning.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.520]   If our life, if our body is a house of God,
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.880]   here's the question.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:46.640]   Are you expecting the Spirit of God
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.880]   to rent or own in your life?
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.400]   Are you realizing, hey, Spirit of God,
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.200]   yes, you live in me, but I don't want you jacking things up.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:03.400]   Like, yes, I love that you have saved me, God.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.040]   I love that you live inside of me,
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.840]   but stay out of the room of my romantic relationships.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.960]   Because I don't exactly trust you
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:16.120]   to provide the right guy or the right girl.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.760]   So let me deal with that.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.600]   Or God, you know what?
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.640]   Stay out of the room of how I spend my money.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.120]   I know I'm living like a $30,000 millionaire,
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.960]   but this is my mid-20s,
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.680]   and I'll figure it out later in life.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.400]   Or God, stay out of the room of my work.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:39.440]   I just want to do the bare minimum and get in and get out.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:45.320]   Stay out of the room of what I'm doing on the weekends
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.440]   or when I go to happy hour.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.640]   You can rent, but you can't own.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:57.040]   When we were moving from College Station to Dallas,
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:02.040]   the night before the morning,
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.680]   when the movers were coming
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.440]   to take all of our stuff away to Dallas,
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.280]   like this was our last night in the house.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.560]   We had already signed papers
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:13.120]   that the house was going to the next owner.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:17.320]   And that night, one of my kids was half asleep.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.280]   He came out and he knocked one of the side tables
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.720]   of the couch, and there was a full glass of water on it.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:27.280]   He knocked it off, and it fell on the ground,
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.680]   and nobody knew it for hours.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.360]   And so that water sat on our wood floor
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.040]   for the entire night, to the point
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.600]   that when I finally cleaned it up,
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.160]   the wood floor had already begun to bubble up,
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.240]   which is problematic
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:45.760]   when it's no longer your house.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.560]   And I remember waking up and panicking
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:55.520]   that this isn't my house anymore.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:00.120]   It doesn't belong to me, so it matters.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.280]   It matters what I do with this house
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.160]   because this no longer is my house.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:10.160]   And I just, I wonder if some of us are missing
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:15.360]   that same conviction of this is no longer my house.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:18.200]   It matters what I do with this house
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.400]   because this house is no longer my house.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.240]   This is the house of God.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:29.600]   And so here's what I'm just asking you to do.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.240]   Jesus valued the temple, cared deeply about the temple,
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.280]   and so should we.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.320]   I'm asking you to just think,
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.400]   are you asking Jesus to rent or own in your life?
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.560]   Because when you ask Jesus to own,
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.720]   it changes everything.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:51.200]   You begin to think, Jesus, is this what you want
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.400]   your eyes looking at right now on my phone
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.800]   or on the computer screen?
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.320]   Jesus, are these the words that you want coming out
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.040]   of my mouth when I'm talking to these people?
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:06.560]   Jesus, is this what you want your body doing in this moment?
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:11.240]   Jesus, is this how you want your body
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.760]   to be working at this job?
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.880]   It just changes.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.000]   It's no longer yours.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.040]   It's his.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:23.200]   And so I'll just, I'll tell you this.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.280]   You know, when, what was the temple for?
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.120]   The temple was a place to worship.
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.480]   Here at Watermark, after every service,
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.520]   at the end of every service,
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.680]   we say have a great week of worship.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.880]   And what we're not saying is,
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:39.280]   hey, go out and sing songs the entire week.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.760]   What we're saying is, hey, when you begin to believe
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:45.920]   that Jesus owns, when the Spirit of God owns,
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.240]   you know what the overflow of your life is?
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.560]   Worship.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.400]   It's worship.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:54.000]   And so I just want you to hear me say this.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.480]   You're either going to spend your time fighting
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.240]   with the Spirit of God or surrendering to the Spirit of God.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:06.160]   But surrender is the shortest path to a godly life.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.360]   It's the shortest path.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.280]   Surrender is.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.160]   So I just want to ask you to think for a second,
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.920]   who's the godliest person that you know?
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.120]   Just think about that real quick.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.240]   Can you, you've got their face in your mind.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:23.000]   Who is the godliest person that you know?
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.600]   Who is it?
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.920]   The reason that they are the way they are
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:37.680]   is because at some point in their life,
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.680]   they made a decision.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:43.040]   The Spirit of God will not rent.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.200]   The Spirit of God will own.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.520]   And then every day since then,
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:51.520]   they've woken up with the same conviction.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:54.160]   And my encouragement is for you to do the same.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.000]   So what do we do with a talk like this?
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.800]   Like where do we go with a talk like this?
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.840]   Well, let me just encourage you to do two things.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.240]   Here's the first thing that I want to encourage you to do.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.760]   When you leave Awakened, when you go home,
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.160]   and you begin to go to your church,
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.760]   your local church on Sundays,
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.960]   when you go to your Porch Live locations
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:18.120]   on whatever night that you guys meet,
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.400]   then let me encourage you,
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.880]   when you show up, you walk into that building
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.600]   with the conviction, God is here,
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.920]   and I am going to meet with Him.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.560]   Like you reject autopilot worship.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.240]   You don't fly in hot 10 to 15 minutes late
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:37.000]   every single week, prioritizing just attendance.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.560]   No, God is here and I get to meet with Him.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.720]   The second thing that I want to encourage you to do
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.560]   is every morning this next week,
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.360]   when you wake up, get on your knees
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.440]   and open up your hands and just say,
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.480]   God, you own.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.840]   You own my mind, you own my heart,
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:58.760]   you own my feelings, you own my body.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.960]   Everything in my life belongs to you.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.360]   I want to live fully surrendered to you.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.680]   There are no rooms in the house of my life
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.080]   that are off limits to you.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.560]   You can redecorate however you want
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.880]   because I belong to you.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:20.240]   But as you do those things, don't forget this.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.480]   All eyes on me, don't forget this.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:28.360]   In the end, it was Jesus that cleansed the temple.
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:32.000]   And that wasn't just an act of judgment,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.560]   that was actually an act of mercy
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.760]   because Jesus Christ was making the temple
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.080]   a place again where people could meet with God.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.120]   Here's what you need to understand.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.760]   When Jesus Christ went to the cross
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.240]   and died for your sins and mine
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.720]   and then rose from the dead,
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.200]   you know what He was doing?
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.840]   He was cleansing your temple.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.480]   When you put your faith in Him,
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:59.360]   He made you clean so that the Spirit of God
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:02.520]   could live inside of you so that you could meet with Him.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.520]   This is what He does, this is His kindness to us.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.680]   I don't come here today to beat you over the head,
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.000]   say, "You gotta get rid of some stuff in your life."
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.720]   I'm here to just say, "Hey, we have a good King
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:18.440]   "and He loves us and it is His joy to cleanse us.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.440]   "He made us right with Him."
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.320]   And if you don't know Jesus today,
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.840]   like if you came into this place
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:27.240]   and you know about Jesus but you don't know Jesus,
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.960]   the one who went to the cross,
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.360]   who died for all of your sins,
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.400]   who on the third day rose from the dead
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.400]   so that when you put your faith in Him,
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.640]   He would make you clean and live in you
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:44.160]   and with you for all of eternity,
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:47.200]   that's who He is and that's what He's come to do.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.760]   I'll end by saying this.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.040]   The theme for the weekend is the rehearsal.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.400]   Why is it called the rehearsal?
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.840]   Because we wanna rehearse here
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.400]   what we will be doing for all of eternity.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:04.360]   So what does the temple have to do with the rehearsal?
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:08.040]   Well, we started and said that in Genesis,
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:12.280]   the Garden of Eden, the garden was the first temple of God
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.320]   and in the temple, the garden temple,
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.200]   God was declaring, "I'm here,"
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.480]   as He walked with Adam and Eve.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.880]   In the tabernacle and in the temple of the Old Testament,
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.640]   the Israelites, they made a structure
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.160]   and the presence of God filled that structure
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.880]   as a declaration, "I am here."
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:34.120]   Jesus Christ left heaven and came to earth
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:37.160]   and He dwelt among men as a declaration
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.240]   from heaven to earth, "I am here."
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.800]   Jesus Christ ascended into heaven and sent His Spirit
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.680]   and His Spirit now fills the people of God collectively
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:52.120]   and when we gather, God is declaring, "I am here."
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:55.440]   And the Spirit of God, when you put faith in Jesus Christ,
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.040]   the Spirit of God comes and lives inside of you
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:00.960]   and every single day, the Spirit of God
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:05.560]   is declaring to you, "I am here."
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.960]   But then you read Revelation 21,
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:10.680]   the new heavens and the new earth and here's what it says.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.080]   It says, "And I heard a loud voice from the throne
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.160]   saying, 'Behold the dwelling place.'"
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.240]   And in the Greek, that word dwelling place,
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.080]   it means tabernacle.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:24.560]   The tabernacle, the temple of God is where?
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.720]   It is with man.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:30.000]   He will dwell with them and they will be His people
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   and God Himself will be with them as their God.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.440]   We will spend all of eternity in the temple of God
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.840]   and for all of eternity,
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:47.840]   God will declare to us, "I am here."
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:52.640]   So what does it look like for us to rehearse
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.360]   for eternity now?
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.240]   It looks like this.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:01.160]   May the presence of God become precious to His people
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.520]   because God is here.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.560]   Let's pray together.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.440]   Lord Jesus, I thank You
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:17.440]   that even now You are here with us.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.520]   I pray that we would have a sense, God,
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:24.320]   that You are here now and You are meeting with us.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.160]   You've given us Your Spirit.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.360]   I pray, Holy Spirit, that You'd be at work
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.920]   moving in every single one of our lives, Lord.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:37.400]   God, we all have things on the bookshelves of our lives
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.020]   that have found a home that just don't belong.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.440]   And so I pray that Your grace would be sufficient
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:47.800]   that no one would walk in shame today because of that,
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.560]   but that they would know You, Lord Jesus,
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.240]   the one who cleanses the temple.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.680]   I pray, God, that even now You would identify things
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:58.260]   in our churches and in our lives individually
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:48:59.400]   that just don't belong.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.760]   And may we experience Your grace in that,
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:06.080]   but may You help us take a step today, Lord.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:12.240]   I pray that we would be a people that just declares,
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:17.500]   You own, You don't rent.
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:22.000]   You can do what You want with our lives.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.220]   We need You.
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.580]   We love You.
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:26.860]   In Jesus' name, amen.
