[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.080]   Love it, keep going.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.220]   Hello, friends in the room.
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.020]   Hello, Fort Worth and friends in Houston.
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.880]   I am gonna start with a story
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.180]   about some of my college experience, how I landed.
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.000]   It'll tell us where we're going.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.080]   I was 18 years old.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.500]   It was my second semester of my senior year in high school
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.180]   and I was enrolled in the University of Texas.
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.280]   If you, yeah, I love this.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.300]   And I was planning on going there.
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.820]   I had a roommate lined up.
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.540]   I had a major that had been picked.
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.780]   I was all set and I got a call from a coach
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.180]   at the University of Texas A&M.
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.460]   Love it, didn't see that coming.
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.740]   And he basically said, hey, I have an opportunity
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.500]   that I want you to be a part of
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.100]   and it involves our track team.
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.260]   And I'm thinking, wait a second, track?
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.020]   I didn't play, I never did track in my whole life.
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.700]   Are you sure you have the right number right now?
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.020]   And the thing involved, and I think Chad is gonna hand me
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.220]   exactly what it involved, and it was an opportunity
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.820]   where he basically said, I want to give you a chance
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.060]   to be on our track team and it involved this.
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.100]   Now, what is this?
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.060]   A giant toothpick, of course.
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.020]   That's not at all what it is.
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.300]   It involved something called the javelin.
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.860]   And I'm going, again, buddy, are you sure
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.140]   you have the right number?
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.780]   And he says, yeah, if you will come to A&M,
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.340]   I will teach you to throw the javelin.
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.000]   Apparently, because no one throws the javelin
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.860]   in this country, or very few people do,
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.980]   the way that they get people on their team
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.940]   is they recruit young 18-year-olds
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.700]   who have no idea what they're doing with their life.
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.220]   And they say, hey, if you come here,
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.980]   I will teach you to throw this,
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.140]   especially those who, I played baseball and football.
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.500]   So he was like, yeah, it'll be great.
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.640]   So anyways, the crazier thing, I end up going,
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.100]   I changed everything for this sport
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.220]   that I'd never been a part of.
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.220]   I didn't even know existed, this thing that was out there
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.100]   called javelin, and being on this track team.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.740]   In other words, I had never once in my life dreamed
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.220]   about going to be a part of a track team
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.840]   and specifically throwing the javelin.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.420]   When you're a little kid sitting around in class,
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.420]   you're like, oh, this is what I'm gonna do
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.020]   for college someday.
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.100]   Never did it across my mind, I'm gonna throw the javelin
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.180]   at Texas A&M.
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.940]   That never happened, and yet, all of a sudden,
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.060]   this thing that I had no idea about
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.160]   really defined my college experience.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.340]   It changed everything.
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.060]   It changed where I was going to school.
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.020]   It changed what I studied, because the program
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.740]   that I was going to study at Texas,
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.340]   the A&M school was not as strong.
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.500]   It wasn't a good thing to study there.
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.740]   So it changed what I studied.
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.940]   It changed my schedule.
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.780]   It changed what I did with my time,
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.940]   because all of a sudden, now I'm a part of this team,
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.100]   and I'm a part of 80 other people
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.220]   who are on this track team, and each person
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.740]   does these different roles and different functions.
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.180]   It put me underneath this new authority
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.580]   of this new coaching staff that I was a part of.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.080]   This thing that I didn't even know existed,
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.820]   javelin, all of a sudden really defined
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.040]   my experience in college, and it changed everything.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.480]   The reason I start there is because tonight,
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.700]   we're gonna talk about something,
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.880]   and it is something that I think many of us in the room
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.580]   don't even know it fully exists,
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.660]   and don't even know why it's so important.
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.680]   It's this thing out there, and it's this decision
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.300]   that if you will make tonight, will define everything
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.220]   for the rest of your life.
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.120]   Or let me say it this way.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.380]   If there was something tonight,
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.220]   or there's something we're gonna discuss tonight,
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.180]   that if you will decide to embrace this truth
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.960]   that we're gonna look at, it will shape
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.900]   the rest of your future.
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.080]   It will provide for you a place where you will be protected
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.060]   from sin for the rest of your life.
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.720]   It will provide a place where you will have
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.700]   deeper relationships than you've ever known before.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.940]   It will provide a place where your relationship with God
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.380]   will be stronger and increasingly stronger.
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.500]   It will provide a place for you to experience
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.260]   and find your purpose.
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.020]   Maybe for the first time ever, you'll experience that.
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.820]   And all of this can take place by simply making a decision.
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.540]   You will set yourself to experience all of those things.
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.600]   What is the thing that you may not even know exists
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.500]   that may define, and if you will allow,
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.480]   is supposed to define everything?
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.500]   The local church.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.220]   Being a part of the local church.
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.700]   In other words, it is in making the decision
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.500]   that I am going to not just, if I'm a Christian,
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.220]   and I'm speaking primarily to Christians
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.940]   in the room tonight, I'm not just going to attend church
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.960]   'cause I'm an adult and this is an adulting thing
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.900]   and I'm growing up and I gotta start going to church.
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.340]   I am going to be the church, and one of the components
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.180]   of being the church is being a part of a local church
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.560]   and a local expression, and if you will make the decision
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.940]   to connect with a local gathering, that will be the thing
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.380]   that shapes the world your children grow up in.
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.720]   It will shape the person that you marry
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.940]   because you won't end up marrying crazy Sally
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.660]   because there'll be people in your life,
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.860]   if your name's Sally, I apologize,
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.060]   or people in your life who will be like,
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.180]   hey, she's crazy Sally, don't marry her.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.700]   You'll have people in your life who will speak it,
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.100]   it will shape so much of the rest of your life
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.260]   if you will just get this one thing,
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.980]   and here's why this is so important.
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.540]   Most of you are not connected to a local church.
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.380]   The vast majority of this room, we know.
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.280]   You may attend a place, you may attend the porch
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.260]   on Tuesdays, you may go to Watermark on Sundays,
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.380]   or the Village, or IBC, or Prestiwood,
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.140]   or any number of different places,
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.860]   but you are not connected and a member of a local church,
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.620]   and you are forfeiting the primary thing God says
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.600]   is the vehicle.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.020]   If you connect with it, that's the thing that I use
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.780]   to change you and to change the world.
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.320]   And so tonight, we're gonna look at the scripture
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.860]   and discuss really this topic of being connected
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.060]   to the local church.
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.180]   My goal, let me get this really clear
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.580]   in case I can't keep your attention
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.420]   and you start counting things up in the air
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.300]   and you're like, is there coffee out in the lobby?
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.980]   I want every single person here to become,
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.400]   if you're a follower of Jesus, a Christian.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.640]   If that's who you are, I'm talking to you,
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.700]   a member of a local church,
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.740]   or obedient to what the scriptures teach
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.000]   would be another way of saying that.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.340]   And so if you're right now going,
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.920]   oh, I just got out of college, I'm not yet a member,
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.180]   I'm talking to you.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.420]   Or if you're going, I've been out of college
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.180]   for like 15 years, I'm still not a member,
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.460]   I'm talking to you.
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.220]   If you are not a member of a local church,
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.340]   whether that's here or another one,
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.300]   that you would connect to a local church.
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.480]   So we're gonna look at three reasons
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.180]   why the scripture teaches that you and I,
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.040]   it is imperative, it is a command for Christians.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.860]   Again, this is for Christians.
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.980]   So if you're not a follower of Christ,
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.060]   you'll just have kind of a window
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.380]   into what the Christian life
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.980]   and living out the Christian life looks like
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.060]   and what specifically being a part of the church
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.100]   in a local church looks like.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.060]   The three reasons we're gonna cover tonight
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.940]   as it relates to why it's so crucial
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.620]   for you to be a part of a local church are these.
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.780]   It is at the local church where you surround yourself
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.820]   with God's people, you submit to godly leadership,
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.800]   and you serve on God's mission.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.940]   It is there that you surround yourself with godly people,
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.420]   you submit to godly leadership,
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.460]   and you serve on his mission.
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.620]   In other words, without a local church,
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.100]   you cannot do any of those,
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.980]   all of which are commands in the New Testament
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.500]   from the God who loves you and wants to lead you
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.460]   for the rest of your life to the abundant life
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.820]   he created you to experience.
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.020]   So we're gonna look at the first one
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.220]   and walk through all of these.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.060]   So the first one of surrounding,
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.940]   why is the local church so important?
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.820]   Because it is there that you surround yourself
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.820]   with God's people.
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.760]   You're gonna surround yourself
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.060]   with lots of people in this world,
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.220]   whether that's your family, whether that's at work,
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.940]   all the different time you're around different groups.
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.980]   Maybe you're in a bowling club,
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.040]   I don't know what you're involved in,
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.040]   but the local church is to be the place
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.340]   where you're surrounded by God's people,
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.420]   by men and women who speak into your life
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.060]   and push you on in your faith.
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.780]   The author of Hebrews addresses this in chapter 10.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.380]   This is gonna be kinda topical.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.380]   We'll do three points and look at scriptures
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.860]   that inform each of those ideas in the scripture.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.700]   The author of Hebrews is gonna talk to us
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.740]   about this first idea.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.780]   The local church is where we surround ourselves
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.140]   with God's people.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.680]   And he says this in chapter 10.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.140]   If you have a Bible, you can flip over there.
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.740]   If not, it'll be on the screens.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.580]   But he says this in chapter 10,
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.020]   and the book of Hebrews is such a great book for us
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.380]   because it's written to a group of new believers.
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.700]   They just put their faith in Jesus,
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.140]   they're trying to figure this thing out,
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.540]   and they're trying to decide,
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.960]   or discover what it looks like to live out this new faith
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.800]   that I have.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.500]   Persecution is going on, and so a lot of them are like,
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.460]   do I really believe this?
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.500]   Should I keep going on?
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.620]   Should I keep pressing on?
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.080]   And the author of Hebrews writes,
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.620]   and he gives them a message saying,
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.100]   don't lose hope, don't let go,
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.580]   continue forward in your faith,
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.300]   and here's one of the ways that you make sure
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.940]   that your faith and your future is protected.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.180]   It's by surrounding yourself.
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.300]   Listen to what he says.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.340]   Verse 23 of chapter 10.
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.540]   Surrounding yourself by God's people.
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.540]   Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess.
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.660]   For he who promised is faithful,
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.700]   and let us consider how we may spur one another
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.840]   on towards love and good deeds,
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.740]   not giving up meeting together,
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.700]   as some are in the habit of doing,
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.580]   but encouraging one another,
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.020]   and all the more as you see the day approaching,
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.560]   or Christ returning.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.400]   I'm gonna read it again,
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.860]   and look to see if you can see anything jumping out.
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:26.580]   Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess.
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.900]   For he who promised is faithful,
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.900]   and let us consider how we may spur one another
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.540]   on towards love and good deeds,
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.220]   not giving up meeting together,
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.560]   as some are in the habit of doing,
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.060]   but encouraging one another,
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.780]   and all the more as you see the day approaching.
[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.280]   What's the author of Hebrews pointing at?
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.220]   How many times does he use these plural expressions?
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.060]   What is he saying?
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.940]   The Christian life is a team sport.
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.540]   The Christian faith is meant to be lived together.
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.740]   It's about we, not about me.
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.820]   The Christian life has always been this thing
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.060]   where we come together.
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.780]   Even what he's telling them as it relates
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.560]   to hey, holding on to hope.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.220]   He's saying that the way that we hold on to hope
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.220]   in a world that feels hopelessly broken is together.
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.180]   Christianity is a team sport.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.380]   It's always been meant to be lived together.
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.900]   The mentality that can hit any of us at any point in life
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.980]   where we just feel discouraged,
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.020]   where we just feel down,
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.220]   where we feel filled with doubt,
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.180]   where we just feel like giving up.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.140]   That's why the author of Hebrews is writing and saying,
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.660]   look, this is a we thing.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.860]   This is where we lock arms.
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.660]   The body of Christ comes together,
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.540]   and it's always been a place where it's not just you alone,
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.060]   you and Jesus all by yourself,
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.980]   but you come together, and you lock arms,
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.400]   and you say, I'm not letting you go,
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.060]   and I need you to not let me go,
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.740]   because sometimes I wanna go after crazy Sally.
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.460]   Sometimes I wanna go after crazy decisions
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.700]   that I know are gonna hurt me,
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.120]   but they still look good to me.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.220]   I need your help.
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.140]   I need to come together.
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.740]   Sometimes I'm just gonna feel overwhelmed with doubt,
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.260]   and the author of Hebrews says the way
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.420]   that you maintain hope in a hopelessly broken world
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.580]   is we, not me.
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.000]   It's always been meant to be done together,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.240]   that you are to connect to a local church,
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.180]   and one of the main reasons the Bible says
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.900]   is because you are meant to have these deep relationships
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.380]   with others in your life who spur you on
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.500]   towards love and good deeds.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.340]   You can't do it alone,
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.260]   and you never intended to.
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.140]   And from the very beginning,
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.380]   the Christian church has always been where we lock arms
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.060]   because we're a bunch of broken, sinful people.
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.100]   That's the requirement to get in,
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.780]   and if you get a bunch of sinners together,
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.980]   of course you're gonna have crazies in there,
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.140]   and of course bad decisions are made,
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.900]   and so we spur, and we help,
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.300]   and hold one another accountable.
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.140]   It's always been meant to be lived together.
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.380]   It's at the heart of Christianity,
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.020]   and that's why having a local church,
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.260]   because where else is that gonna take place?
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.420]   It's always been a together thing.
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.980]   This is why the mentality of like, hey, I'm good, man.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.860]   Look, I'm not a part of a church,
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.220]   but I got me and Jesus, me and Jesus are good right now.
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.520]   You know the Bible says that's not good?
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.940]   The very first thing that God says is not good.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.980]   Anyone know what it is?
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.180]   In Genesis 2, 18, the world was just created.
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.160]   Everything's perfect.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.260]   There's no sin, no apple, none of that's taken place yet.
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.620]   In the world, Adam is hanging out with God.
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.260]   You would think like, oh man, that's amazing.
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.980]   If anyone could ever say, hey, I'm good,
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.900]   I got me and God, we're in perfect relationship,
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.480]   there's no sin, I'm just hanging out naked with the animals,
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.240]   everything's going great, and the Bible says this.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.820]   Before sin, God looks down and he says,
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.460]   it's been like 15 minutes, and he's like, this is not good.
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.300]   Here's what it says, Genesis 2, 18.
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.700]   The Lord God said, before any sin had entered,
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.540]   it is not good for man to be alone.
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.720]   I will make a helper suitable for him.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.640]   In other words, it's not good just God and Adam.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.760]   There has to be a human relationship involved.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.200]   If anyone could ever say, I mean, think about that.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.960]   Adam is in perfect relationship.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.400]   Adam, arguably, you would think would be the only guy
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.900]   who'd be like, yeah, it's me and Jesus, everything's great,
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.240]   and Jesus, who's in the beginning, we're told,
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.920]   is like, hey, time out, not good, we're all alone here.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.580]   He needs someone else involved.
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.080]   A man alone with God in the garden,
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.280]   and God says he needs human relationship.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.000]   He's designed and created to experience that community.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.120]   Where does that take place?
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.680]   At the church.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.180]   The other phrase that flies in the face
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.480]   of the New Testament idea of like,
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.000]   you're meant to be a part of the church,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   is this idea of like, yeah, I love Jesus,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.360]   but I don't like the church.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.400]   Please don't ever say that again, if nothing else,
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.520]   because how insane that statement is.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.740]   The Bible says the church is the bride
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.620]   or the wife of Christ.
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.960]   You following me on this?
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.360]   In other words, when you say, hey, I love Jesus,
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.440]   but I don't like Jesus' wife, think how that is gonna go.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.080]   Like, what husband, if you came up to me,
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.520]   and you're like, yeah, David, I love you, man.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.040]   Hey, I'm just not a big fan of your wife.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.440]   I mean, what am I, be like, I'm about to swing at you.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.400]   What husband would not, what husband would be like,
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.980]   hey, man, it's cool, yeah, dude, ah, I agree.
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.080]   What husband would say that?
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.320]   Do you think Christ, the perfect husband,
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.320]   is just gonna be like, yeah, that's fine, great,
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.200]   you don't have to.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.200]   Then no, we're always meant to be a part of it.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.500]   We're always meant to be together.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.540]   That's the essence of church.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:17.760]   It's not dissimilar from, really, the Christian life,
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.520]   and being together is not dissimilar
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.320]   from like, when I was throwing javelin.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.360]   If you came up after this message,
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.400]   and for the person who says, I'm a Christian,
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.040]   but I'm not connected to a local church,
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.520]   you are like a person who comes up after this message
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.600]   and is like, you threw javelin in college.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.560]   Hey, I did too, and I respond with, oh, man, awesome,
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.000]   where did you throw javelin?
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.120]   You're like, just in my backyard, you know, it was great.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.680]   I was throwing it up in the air, and it was awesome,
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.080]   and it's like, you are not a javelin thrower.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.640]   You are a man with a weird hobby, is what you are.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.600]   That's not a javelin, that's what a Christian is
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.360]   who doesn't have a local church.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.600]   You following me?
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.800]   You're like the person who's just throwing the javelin
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.200]   in his backyard up in the air
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.800]   as though that's how you throw it.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.980]   You are that person.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.760]   It was always designed, and you were always intended
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.160]   to live together because, and the author of Hebrews here
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:14.160]   says because we live in a broken world that's just hard.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.840]   We live in a world where we just need one another,
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.360]   like we need encouragement.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.680]   Who are you gonna turn to in life when cancer strikes,
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.160]   when, honestly, when you just walk through a breakup,
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.520]   how horrible are breakups, even if you do them all right?
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.000]   You're gonna turn to Margarita night?
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.560]   You're gonna turn to Bluebell?
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.380]   Who are you gonna turn to?
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.000]   You're gonna turn to friends that just push you
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.200]   in a terrible direction?
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.120]   How are you gonna make sure the breakup doesn't break you?
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.360]   And it's the body of Christ coming around you saying,
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.320]   hey, I'm gonna walk with you.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.360]   I know what you're going through.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.400]   I'm here for your pain, whether that's a breakup,
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.800]   maybe it's a layoff from a job, whatever it is,
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.080]   I'm not letting you go, I'm here for you.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.460]   And the author of Hebrews says that's the local church
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.600]   that's always been intended to be this way.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.720]   And where are you gonna find this?
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.400]   Like, you're not gonna find this at work.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.720]   You're not gonna find this at the gym.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.160]   At work, you're gonna find,
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.440]   you're lucky if you get a 401k and a dental plan.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.300]   You're not gonna have people who are gonna speak
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.120]   the words of life to you, who are gonna say,
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.880]   look, I'm gonna remind you of truth
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.200]   when you are running from it.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.280]   I'm not gonna let you go.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.960]   I'm gonna come pray for you when you don't even wanna pray.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.240]   I'm just gonna, you just sit there
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.500]   and I'm gonna pray for you.
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.420]   We're gonna pray together and I'm not leaving.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.640]   Where are you gonna find, at the gym
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.840]   with your spin instructor?
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.840]   These relationships are, they exist inside of the church.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.560]   And it's there that you and I discover them
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.920]   and we're created to experience them.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.760]   The second reason it's so crucial that you connect
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.780]   to a local body is probably going to be the one
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.700]   that everyone resists the most, and it's the second one.
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.880]   It's there that we submit to godly leadership.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.140]   Everyone's favorite S word, submit.
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.820]   Submit to godly leadership.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.280]   The Bible says this in Hebrews 13.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.680]   Obey your leaders and submit to them,
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.800]   for they are keeping watch over your souls
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.040]   as those who will have to give an account.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.720]   This is terrifying.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.480]   Let them do this with joy and not with groaning,
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.400]   for that would be of no advantage to you.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.840]   Obey your leaders and submit to them.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:14.920]   I want you to think about something.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.920]   If you're a Christian, how do you obey this verse
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.540]   without being a part of a local church?
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:27.240]   Just obey any Christian leaders?
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.240]   Like, if you're a Christian and you got leadership gifts,
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.400]   I guess I'm supposed to obey you.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.520]   What should I do today?
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.840]   What are you to do if you don't have a local church?
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.080]   How can you obey that verse?
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.000]   Of course it's not all leaders.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.020]   It's clear he's speaking about the leadership
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.800]   of a local church that you are to be a part of,
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.200]   to be led and cared for and shepherded,
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.780]   and they're gonna give an account to God
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.880]   for how they do so.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.600]   But you can't obey this passage
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.700]   if you're not connected to a local church.
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:06.280]   The elders that are here, if you are here,
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.440]   I wrote just in my notes,
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.560]   man, you have got some godly elders who are not perfect,
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.460]   but they are purposeful,
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.240]   and they are men who are leading this flock,
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.360]   and they will give an account before God
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.040]   for every person who is a member here.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.000]   But if you attend here,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.480]   that does not include you necessarily.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.860]   If you are a member and you've committed here,
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.920]   and if you're a Christian
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.640]   and you're not a part of a local church,
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.840]   or you're not a member,
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.960]   who's gonna give an account for you
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.600]   when you stand before God?
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.840]   Like, you'll give an account for yourself,
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.940]   but when God's like, all right,
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.760]   and David, where are your elders?
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.120]   And it's like, well,
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.960]   I don't know that I really had any.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.520]   What church were you a part of?
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.560]   Well, I kind of rotated.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.600]   I went here a couple times,
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.560]   I went here a few times,
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.400]   and it's like, yeah,
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.800]   but which one did you become a part of?
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.960]   Well, I'm not sure that I ever became a part of one,
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.480]   but I did listen to Matt Chandler,
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.360]   and Francis Chan, and John Piper a lot.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.800]   It's gonna be like, Piper, you know this guy, huh?
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.840]   Back of the line, that's not gonna happen at all.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.920]   But who's gonna give an account
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.160]   when you stand before God?
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.120]   Even the answer that I won't have any elders
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.760]   could be an indictment against the fact
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.520]   that you weren't, in this area, obedient,
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.360]   and you didn't experience, because of that,
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.560]   the shepherding and protection that comes.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.480]   The reason God wants you to submit and yield to elders
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.000]   is because he has placed leadership there
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.460]   to care for, to love, to protect.
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.180]   So you're not just someone who comes in,
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.560]   and attends, and disappears,
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.760]   but you're someone who's known and connected.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.280]   And I know a lot of you in this room,
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.200]   even that word submit and obey
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.120]   can bring up bad memories or bad feelings
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.800]   because the experience you've had of church
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.840]   wasn't a good one.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.480]   And a couple things on that.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.920]   One, there is no perfect church.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.760]   It was filled, and the experience, if you had a bad one,
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.960]   it's not surprising because the church
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.160]   is full of imperfect people.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.520]   It's a requirement to get in.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.360]   And the second one is that's why it's so important
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.640]   to be a part of a place with godly leadership.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.040]   And so if you've given up on being a part of a church,
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.640]   that is insane logic.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.240]   Like, that's like giving up on the doctor
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.800]   if you had a bad doctor experience.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.640]   You think about that?
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.120]   It's like, look, I am done with the whole medical community.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.000]   I am out of here.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.720]   This guy was horrible.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.380]   If you had a bad experience in the church,
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.220]   it's the same thing.
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.120]   You don't give up on the church.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.040]   You connect to a place with godly leadership,
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.300]   and you yield and submit underneath that.
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.760]   Underneath, and by submission,
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.560]   like just to bring real clarity to that,
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.880]   'cause like, what, I'm supposed to submit?
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.840]   Submitting like here at Watermark is going,
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.880]   oh, I'm gonna be a part of a community group.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.480]   I'm gonna serve somewhere.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.580]   Those are the ways that we submit or we yield to.
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:54.160]   We follow along the shepherding that God has put in place.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.840]   The reason elders are crucial
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.280]   is because they provide the protection for your life.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.880]   As you walk through this life, protection from what?
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.300]   Two things.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.400]   The first is yourself, because you crazy too.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.320]   It's true.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.200]   Like, the first is all of us, as broken sinners,
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.140]   we're prone to wander, we're prone to go off,
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.500]   and it's having elders in place.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.160]   There's a process for someone to say,
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.160]   hey, I'm coming, I'm going to meet with you,
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.520]   I'm gonna pursue you, I'm gonna care for you.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.320]   Anytime you've already said and you declared,
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.840]   I wanna be a part of this church body,
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.960]   I wanna follow Jesus, and so if you're unwilling to do that,
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.080]   I'm going to be with you, talk with you,
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.340]   meet with you, pray with you,
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.560]   show you in God's word how that's done,
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.640]   so that you don't just wander off.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.340]   Like, all of us are just prone to do that,
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.680]   to wander off, to move from our faith.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.680]   Us on the stage are prone to wander off,
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.960]   that's why we need community and elders in our life.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.320]   We're all like one second away from a bad decision.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.620]   My son, I have a nine week old baby,
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.320]   so we're not sleeping a lot right now,
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.760]   and he is like just a little milk monster,
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.560]   and he's doing one of three things at all times,
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.900]   sleeping, pooping, and eating,
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.680]   and I tell my wife, like, he is always
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.920]   about six seconds away from a bad attitude.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.900]   If he wakes up and he does not get milk,
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:16.060]   and I want it now, ah, everything goes haywire,
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.700]   and everything goes crazy, because he's going,
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.840]   I want it now, I want it now.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:25.080]   It was like the Lord was, I don't know if this was
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.160]   the Lord speaking, or just a thought in my head,
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.160]   but as I was thinking about that, you never do,
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.900]   or you do, maybe you do, I don't know,
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.980]   let's get back to that.
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.920]   As I was thinking about that, it was like the Lord
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.900]   was like, David, you are six seconds away
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.720]   from a bad attitude, have you noticed that?
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.880]   At any point in time, I can move and make it
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.640]   six seconds away from a bad decision.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.720]   I can be leaving Bible study and be like,
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.400]   man, Lord, you're awesome, amazing,
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.080]   get in traffic and be like, oh my gosh,
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.100]   what is going on here, people?
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.760]   Drive the car the speed limit, and all of a sudden,
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.800]   everything's falling apart, and if you're,
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.640]   I'm getting a lot of judgment, wait 'til you're
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.400]   in that parking lot tonight, and you are about
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.640]   to leave Bible study and experience it yourself,
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.880]   but it's the same way.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.960]   I know that all of us in the room can experience that,
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.420]   or many of us, maybe you're a little more stable.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.580]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.140]   Where you're like, God is so good right now,
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.380]   why would he break up with me, where are you, Lord?
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.500]   In a second, any of us can be six seconds,
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.340]   and less than that from a bad decision,
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:26.060]   a bad mindset that can lead us down a path,
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.940]   and those are humorous ones, but the reality is,
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.220]   the ones that we can walk towards because of the sin
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.460]   inside of us are not humorous at all,
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.160]   and so having shepherds there to protect us from ourself,
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.080]   it's not only protection from ourself
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.080]   that we find in the local church,
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.180]   we find protection from an enemy.
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.480]   The Bible teaches that you and I are at war,
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.320]   there's this spiritual war going on,
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.440]   and we have an enemy whose name is Satan,
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.800]   and he has come to destroy your life.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.600]   He's come to get you to engage in whatever he can
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.280]   that will distract you from pursuing Christ,
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.080]   from pursuing eternal things,
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.800]   from not being a part of the church.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.660]   He's come to kill and destroy,
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.040]   and this is what 1 Peter tells us about that enemy
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.660]   and why we need elders to protect us in our life.
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.720]   Written by Peter in chapter five, verse eight,
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:20.520]   he says this, "Your enemy, the devil,
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.880]   "prows around like a roaring lion
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.040]   "looking for someone to devour."
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:30.360]   That Peter, who wrote at a time,
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.600]   and he's writing spiritually,
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.520]   hey, we have this enemy, Satan, the devil,
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.400]   who is trying to destroy your life,
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.680]   looking for someone who we can pick off,
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.520]   who's isolated, who we can pick off from the flock
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.660]   and devour.
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.680]   Peter, who had seen Christians,
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.320]   not spiritually get devoured,
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.200]   physically get devoured,
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.700]   likely, during the persecution that's going on
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.720]   that we know was going on,
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.940]   Peter looks at that and he goes,
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.220]   oh my gosh, in the same way,
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.000]   that's what Satan is out to do to you and to me,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.200]   and if you don't believe it,
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.420]   you're likely headed towards the path of that happening,
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.360]   that he's out to devour.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.480]   I don't even fully know what that means,
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.160]   but I feel like I've seen it.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:13.920]   Devour faith in people's lives,
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.680]   devour marriages,
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.560]   devour their financial world,
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.720]   devour their future,
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.020]   devour their relationship with their children,
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.280]   and one of the reasons we need elders in a local church
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.880]   is because it offers and provides the protection
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.920]   from ourselves and from an enemy
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.240]   where we help one another,
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.080]   shepherd one another,
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.400]   and care for one another
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.160]   so that we are underneath that protection,
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.720]   and we are most vulnerable
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:46.000]   when we're isolated or alone or not connected.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.820]   If you are in the room and you're not connected,
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.900]   you're most vulnerable,
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.360]   and you will continue to be vulnerable
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.080]   if you don't have,
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:56.900]   and you're a Christian
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.200]   and you don't have others in your life
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.600]   who can care,
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.680]   come alongside,
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.880]   encourage.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.480]   The final reason why the local church is so crucial
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.220]   is because it's there that we serve on God's mission.
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.340]   It's there that you serve with the gifts he's given you
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.020]   as a part of God's mission.
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.880]   This is what Paul writes in Romans chapter 12,
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.020]   starting in verse four.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.880]   For just as each of us has one body with many members,
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.640]   so each of us has a body and members are like,
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.400]   oh my, I got hands, I got feet, I got legs,
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.720]   and these members don't all have the same function,
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.060]   so I don't just have like five legs.
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:36.080]   And so in Christ, though many form one body,
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.760]   so though we in Christ,
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.640]   though many we form one body,
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.560]   and each member belongs to all the others.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.540]   What are you talking about, Paul?
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.440]   We're all different and it's like we're this body,
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.680]   that's what the body of Christ is,
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.920]   where each person is a hand or a foot
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.740]   or an eye or something different.
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.080]   Yes, and what I mean by that
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.080]   is I'm talking about their gifts,
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.400]   who God has made them,
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.920]   says this in verse six.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.240]   We each have different gifts
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.240]   according to the grace given to each of us.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.000]   God made you different than he made me.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.280]   And he wired and brings together this beautiful gathering
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.380]   of different men and different women,
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.100]   each with different gifts, different spiritual gifts,
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.240]   different natural giftings, different personalities,
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.600]   and he brings them together to form the body of Christ.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.320]   And it's more perfect when they're united.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.840]   It would be less perfect if they were all feet,
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.620]   if it was just one big foot.
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.560]   It's more perfect by the complementary different parts
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.400]   that make it up.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.740]   And he lists out some of those gifts.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.800]   We each have different gifts.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.440]   If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.800]   And prophesying in the New Testament, quickly,
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.760]   is different than the prophets in the Old Testament.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.880]   Prophets in the Old Testament
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.640]   would speak foretelling the future.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.760]   Prophetic gift in the New Testament
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.020]   is primarily truth-telling, like boldness,
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.520]   speaking directly, speaking intentionally.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.800]   JP has the gift of prophetic things,
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.740]   where he's just like, look,
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.120]   break up with your boyfriend now, okay?
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.920]   He's not a believer, and don't call me again.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.160]   I don't know if anyone's calling him.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.720]   But something where you speak boldly, that's prophetic.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.160]   That would be a prophetic example.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.280]   And I know there's gonna be people upset about that.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.720]   I'll read the verse that informs that.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.920]   First Corinthians 14.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.720]   Paul, again, what is prophecy?
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.400]   It's a person that speaks.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.080]   First Corinthians 14, three.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.760]   The one who prophesies, what do they do?
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.840]   They speak for the people for their strengthening,
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.360]   for their encouraging, and for their comfort.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.040]   It's this bold, that's what prophetic is.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:28.880]   Moving on.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.680]   Okay, if it's that, then do that.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.840]   If it's serving, then serve.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.020]   If it's teaching, then teach.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.160]   If it is to encourage, then encourage.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.560]   If it is giving, then give generously.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.280]   If it's lead, do so diligently.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.520]   If it's show mercy, then do it cheerfully.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.320]   Whatever it is, it's not an exhaustive lift.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.240]   He basically says, look,
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.440]   everybody has been given these different gifts.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.140]   God made you different from me.
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.520]   And your gift is just as valuable as mine,
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.680]   and the church is a place where we come together
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.680]   and we serve God's mission by using whatever way
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.400]   God made you to build up the body of Christ,
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.680]   serving with your gift here,
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.620]   and to be a part of the mission
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.900]   of reaching the world for Christ.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.080]   The church is a place where you bring your gifts.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.960]   If you're artistic and you're good at art,
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.900]   maybe you're good at video,
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.640]   maybe you're good at any list of different things,
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.920]   maybe you're good at just leading,
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.200]   maybe you're an entrepreneur.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.800]   The church, and this is so huge,
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.480]   because for so long, this is,
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.280]   I don't know why this has always been absent
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.780]   for so many churches in our country.
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.860]   It's a place where you, just like God made you,
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.800]   you come in and you go, this is what I can do,
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.820]   this is what I'm gonna offer,
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.160]   this is what I'm gonna dream.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.920]   I feel like we could take the next level
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.920]   as it relates to artistic gifts.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.520]   The church, as much as anybody in this world,
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.960]   any organization in this world,
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.800]   they need to be the best social media people of all time.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.680]   They need to be the best at encouraging
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.960]   and reaching the lost, producing content
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.840]   that's gonna be excellent, because you know what?
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.680]   Coca-Cola's selling stuff and they're doing it for money.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.960]   We're doing it for the souls of people.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.280]   The church comes together, your gifts, my gifts,
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.440]   we all come together and we go,
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.560]   no gift is better than the other,
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.280]   we're just gonna put 'em all on the table and go,
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.840]   God, use us, do whatever you want to with us.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.600]   It's not about me, it's not about what I like,
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.760]   we're gonna come together and we're gonna reach the world
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.520]   for Christ, and you can golf clap all day long,
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.320]   but that's the purpose for which you were created.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:20.480]   And if you're sitting on the sideline with gifts,
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.400]   you are wasting your talent.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.360]   You are wasting what God has given you.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.080]   Some of you guys are leaders out there,
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.760]   and man, we need godly men, we need godly leaders
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.480]   who are gonna go, hey, we're gonna take Uptown by storm.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.480]   We're gonna help people reject the lie
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.920]   that the next hangover is really worth it.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.320]   Are you serious?
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.280]   How much better is the message of hope
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.080]   and life that we offer to the world?
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.960]   And are we gonna hold onto our gifts and be like,
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.560]   yeah, I'm pretty detail-oriented,
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.560]   but I'll just work on these expel spreadsheets by myself.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.440]   Are we gonna provide them to the body of Christ?
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:56.480]   Man, God has made you for something
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.520]   so much bigger than yourself, and that something
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.080]   is being a part of the greatest movement
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.300]   the world's ever seen, the body of Christ.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.240]   The thing that I don't care where you're working right now,
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.280]   way outlasts what you're doing.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.280]   In 1,000 years, Coca-Cola will be no more,
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.360]   and if you're like, eh, they could hang around, likely.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.640]   I mean, let's be honest, for real, 1,000 years ago,
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.800]   what was going on 1,000 years?
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.320]   But you know what will be around?
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.960]   The church, the body of Christ.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.720]   We're actually promised by Jesus
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.960]   the gates of death will not be able to stop it.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.400]   The gates of death have stopped a lot of things,
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:37.080]   empires, people, but they cannot stop
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.720]   and will not stop the church.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.360]   Will you come and be a part of it?
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.320]   It's a place where you serve God's mission.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.140]   You're a part of building up
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.800]   and being involved with God's people.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.120]   There's so many in this group.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:52.920]   I love the porch because our volunteers are unbelievable.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.780]   If we told you how much our volunteers did,
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.860]   you'd be like, what do you guys do all day?
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.480]   Because they just get it.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.080]   They're going, hey, we're gonna make this place better.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.360]   We're gonna make this city more covered
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.780]   and reached for Christ.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.760]   Volunteers like Lance Thrillkill,
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.480]   who's been a part of this ministry for a long time,
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.680]   and honestly, there's so many,
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.920]   it's almost hard to mention 'em.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.760]   Lance was throwing parties in Dallas for a living.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.960]   That's what he was doing.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.840]   Lance came on, became a volunteer,
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.840]   became a part of just throwing parties
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.320]   for prodigals to come home.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.400]   He's going, the church should be the most alive,
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.560]   fun, engaging place in the world.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.560]   So many places, people don't like to go to church.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.280]   You should be dying inside until you get to church.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.920]   You're like, I can't wait to get there.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:33.760]   That's what it should be.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.120]   So he's like, we're gonna throw parties here.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:35.960]   Of course we are.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.560]   Ryan Wall, who's an entrepreneur
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.200]   who has done so many different things
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.280]   and initiatives to be a part of
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.760]   reaching young adults for Christ.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.920]   Started Unashamed, started a bunch of different things.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.400]   Unashamed is that three-day in-town mission trip,
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.240]   and it's just led by a guy who wasn't on staff,
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.720]   who just said, we can go to Africa for mission trips,
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.400]   or we can live on mission in the city
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.360]   where we actually speak the same language.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.120]   I feel like that's what we should do,
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.840]   and he just started this initiative.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.320]   Jocelyn Jesus, who heads up our arts team
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.080]   with some other incredible artists,
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.160]   and they donate and give their time,
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.320]   not to just create like, oh, I like this drawing,
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:12.080]   this is fun, but to create artistic stuff
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.440]   that reaches young adults for Christ.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.120]   And so many others who give their life
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.400]   and give their gifts for something
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.120]   way bigger than themselves.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:25.600]   Will you jump in and be a part of getting on the team?
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.720]   In conclusion, the reason why a local church is so crucial
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.160]   is because it is there that you surround yourself
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:37.080]   with godly people, you submit to,
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.160]   and are shepherded by godly leadership
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.880]   who protect you and protect me.
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:45.400]   And it's there where we serve the body of Christ.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.040]   Where do you do those things
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.880]   if you don't have a local church?
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.040]   You don't.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.040]   You're the javelin thrower who's like,
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.400]   I threw, but I threw it in my backyard.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:05.360]   The final picture, I'll land with this.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.120]   While I was at A&M, the track team was there,
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.760]   and it was like such a perfect picture,
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.600]   honestly, of the body of Christ in so many ways,
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:16.680]   because you'd come together, and there was like 80 of us,
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.480]   and you'd go to the track meet,
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.240]   and everyone did their different role and different part.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.440]   Like everyone looked different,
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.000]   and everyone had these different events
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.840]   that they were a part of and different things that they did.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.880]   They had like the six foot seven, 350 pound shot put guy
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.840]   who would throw the shot put,
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.400]   and then you had next to him
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.400]   this like 100 pound, five mile runner girl,
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.800]   and then next to him you had this six foot long jumper,
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.080]   and then you had all these different people
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.080]   who played all these different parts,
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.400]   and they worked best together
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.600]   when they each played their roles.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.560]   In other words, if the shot put guy was like,
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.240]   I think I'm gonna take on the five mile today,
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.400]   fee, fi, fo, fum, it would be terrible, right?
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.920]   Where did that come from?
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.200]   It would be terrible.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.360]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.560]   Fee, fi, fo, fum.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.720]   Okay, it would be terrible, right?
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.020]   Like the team would suffer.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.120]   No, he was designed and created,
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.840]   he does best when he's doing what he was designed
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.320]   and created to do, playing his role on the team.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.880]   Same with the five mile runner.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:20.000]   In the body of Christ, like we're stronger together
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.120]   when we all come and we say, I'm gonna play my role,
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.560]   I'm gonna do my part, this is what I can bring to the table,
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.280]   this is the role that I'm going to play.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.000]   And just like in that track team,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.360]   when the runner was going
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.920]   and the shot put guy was over there, they championed.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.600]   You do what you do, you run.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.160]   I can't run, but I wanna see you run, you're doing awesome.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.160]   I'm not angry at not having the ability to run,
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.960]   I'm not jealous of it, I'm gonna champion you.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.540]   We're stronger together because when you win, I win.
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.920]   We're the body of Christ, we're all gonna come together
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.620]   and do whatever, we don't have to be the best
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.040]   in the world at anything, but we can say,
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.640]   God, this is the best that I can have
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.840]   and I want you to have it, I'm gonna give it to you.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.960]   This is how it was made and I wanna surrender, submit that
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.720]   and serve you with it.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.180]   The invitation tonight, if you're not a part
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:07.300]   of a local church, this Sunday, for those of us in Dallas,
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.780]   for Fort Worth, Garrett's gonna talk to you
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:10.020]   about what you have coming up.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:15.020]   This Sunday at 11.15 a.m., come and be a part
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:19.020]   of a local church, it's membership class this Sunday.
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.940]   If you're like, do you guys just wanna grow Watermark?
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.580]   Let me just say, there is no part of us that wants to grow,
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.700]   I guess there is a part of us that wants to grow Watermark.
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.260]   If there's lots of lost people out there,
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.820]   we're great with growing 'em and growing 'em
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.960]   and you can go to another church
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.300]   if that rubs you the wrong way.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.900]   We're great with reaching lost people.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.220]   But primarily, the reason why we want you to be connected
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.700]   is because it grows you.
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:42.660]   You will get a lot more than you ever give.
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.460]   And so if you're not a part of a local church,
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.120]   this is your weekend.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:50.420]   This is your step to adulting.
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.300]   You know, there's high schoolers in this body
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.900]   who are members, that's just embarrassing, lots of 'em,
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.820]   who are members of this church, like they're in high school,
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:02.380]   16, which is unbelievable to be like, I'm 16,
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.380]   I'm gonna go through membership.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.140]   And we have 28-year-olds who are gonna,
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.400]   I've never taken that step.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.340]   I think a lot of you never even knew that it was important.
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:11.740]   But now you know.
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:15.500]   And the God who loves you is not trying to rip you off,
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.940]   not trying to get something from you,
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.100]   but give something to you, is inviting you,
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:23.400]   you connect to the body of Christ where you will change.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:27.500]   Connect to the body of Christ where through it,
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:32.500]   the world is changed, has been changed, and will change.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.940]   If you're not a part of that,
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.580]   I'm gonna pray that you would be.
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:39.360]   Let me pray.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.640]   Father, I pray for my friends in the room,
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.760]   thank you for just the gift of your church,
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.300]   your bride, who you love,
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:51.300]   who you say that you bought your own blood with,
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.700]   who you hold in such high regard that you say
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.980]   the elders are the leadership of a church,
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:00.060]   a local flock, they're gonna give an account to me.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.220]   And so Father, I pray for our elders,
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.780]   would you protect them, would you lead them,
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.820]   would they hear your voice,
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:11.900]   would they yield to your word and to your spirit?
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.300]   I pray for my friends in the world, in the room,
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.500]   who are not a part of a local church,
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.380]   would you convict, would you move them?
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.820]   Maybe it's not here, maybe it's another church.
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.540]   Lord, would you move them to join another church,
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.680]   to give their gifts to another church,
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:32.140]   but to give it to the bride of Christ at some local church?
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:35.940]   Thank you for Jesus, who loves us as his bride,
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.620]   despite all of our flaws, all of our imperfections,
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:43.820]   and who allows us to serve with our gifts,
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:46.920]   allows us to be protected through godly leadership,
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.060]   allows us to be loved, cared for,
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:52.780]   and surrounded by godly people, would that mark our lives?
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.180]   Thank you, in Jesus' name, amen.
