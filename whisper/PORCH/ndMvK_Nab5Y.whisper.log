[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.380]   All right, let's go.
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.620]   Welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.580]   Fort Worth, El Paso, Phoenix, Houston,
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.200]   Cedar Rapids,
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.500]   Mint Hill, North Carolina, Northwest Arkansas,
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.300]   wherever you joining in from,
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.960]   tuning in from.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.220]   We're kicking off a new series tonight,
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.860]   Bloodline, where we for the next four weeks
[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.900]   are gonna look at the overarching main story of the Bible
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.080]   and trace through the bloodline of Jesus.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.700]   Let me start like this.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.660]   I don't wanna brag,
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.660]   but I have been told that a part of the Marvin family,
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.620]   as somebody traced it,
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.540]   originally landed in the 1600s
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.580]   and was one of like 16 different people
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.580]   that founded Norfolk, Connecticut and Hartford, Connecticut.
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.120]   And just as we like trace through our family lineage,
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.000]   it's just been traced back to once upon a time,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.840]   David Marvin,
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.940]   there was somebody way, way back named Matthew Marvin,
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.260]   even a son named Matthew Marvin.
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.700]   And apparently this family was one of like 16 people
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.920]   that made a big deal if you're from Connecticut.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.200]   And inside of that city today,
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.580]   there's like plaques and even statues
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.620]   devoted to this group of settlers
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.100]   who founded the original thing.
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.820]   They came over from England on this,
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.340]   not on Plymouth, but on Increase,
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.140]   and they just were a part of this original group.
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.420]   And it was pretty crazy to find all this out
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.260]   'cause then it's like,
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.900]   oh dude, this guy has a Wikipedia page.
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.180]   He had a son that was a House of Representative member.
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.020]   Like dude, this is in our family.
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.620]   And then it never really felt like
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.940]   something I was connected to, and here's why.
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.620]   At the same time, that seemed kind of cool.
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.140]   It always felt like, yeah, it's just kind of cool.
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.600]   And it was because my grandfather,
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.000]   whose name our family Marvin comes from,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.440]   was adopted into his family.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.200]   He was adopted and really left on the doorstep
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.700]   of a doctor in town,
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.900]   and apparently there was some young pregnancy
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.700]   that had the baby and didn't feel like
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.800]   they could have the baby at that time,
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.920]   so they gave it up for adoption.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.800]   And so he was adopted,
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.500]   and we've never known who the family line was,
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.540]   who we actually are.
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.240]   We were adopted into this Marvin family,
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.980]   and we've always wondered, or I've always wondered,
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.540]   my siblings, cousins, everyone's like,
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.180]   man, I wonder who actually is our family,
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.820]   because that transforms everything from like,
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.460]   look, dude, wow, we're a really big deal.
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.820]   We're part of the House of Representatives.
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.940]   We got our name on a plaque and out there,
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.140]   to just kind of like, oh, that's not really us.
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.940]   That just, it might as well be George Washington
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:39.780]   or something out there.
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.340]   It's no longer something significantly tied
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.340]   because it's not in our blood.
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.140]   And we've never known who it was,
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.220]   and there's always been this curiosity.
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.860]   And we could do like ancestry.com or 23andMe
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.700]   or any of the blood tests,
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.160]   but that doesn't actually give you like the exact tracing.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.320]   It kind of goes, you know,
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.840]   you're from the continent of Europe, which shocker.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.180]   And we knew that,
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.440]   but we never would be able to trace who it was
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.760]   until last summer.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.240]   What happened last summer?
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.160]   My uncle, Uncle Rusty,
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.360]   who's about as close to the character of Kramer
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.360]   on Seinfeld as any person on the planet,
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.760]   had basically come in and he was like,
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.080]   guys, I solved the mystery.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.900]   I've been tracing.
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.920]   And he had gone out and like,
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.720]   close to Kramer, I'm not kidding at all.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.460]   Like Uncle Rusty, he's an artist by trade.
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.640]   Doesn't really do a ton and hangs out at the house.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.260]   And he let himself on just this investigative work
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.540]   where he was gonna find out exactly
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.380]   who was in the family tree.
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.540]   So he called up different people.
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.900]   We were from this small town in Kansas.
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.400]   He called up family members who might've known someone,
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.540]   who knew somebody, who knew somebody,
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.380]   and he traced down.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.100]   I mean, he like was buying different pieces
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.620]   of anything that he could find related to that town.
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.460]   He would like buy it up,
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.380]   even if it was a postcard or a stamp.
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.180]   He was going all in to investigate,
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.980]   and he found, and one day he let all the family know.
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.980]   I found out who grandpa's original parents were.
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.860]   I mean, this was a game changer.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.380]   He like sent us all the research.
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.580]   And by Kramer, I further mean like,
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.220]   this wasn't like ancestry.com, like,
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.060]   oh, that's kind of cool.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.860]   You know, click the button and it fills it out.
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.640]   He's like, dude, I don't even use a computer.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.060]   You go into his house and on the wall,
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.260]   it's like just pictures and ropes tied to things.
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.380]   And he's like, I've got, I'm not kidding at all.
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.460]   It's amazing.
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.660]   And when he solved the mystery
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.100]   and he sent us all this information,
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.580]   like he sent me this binder
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.420]   where like everything's handwritten now
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.980]   on like this person's related here.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.740]   And he traced it all the way back into like Germany
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.340]   and into the 1700s of this is actually who you're from
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.500]   and the family lineage that you're a part of.
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.980]   And as a family, I remember getting out,
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.300]   you have like my siblings and you're kind of fascinated.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.020]   I feel like there's always one kind of family tree person
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.220]   in every family who geeks out about it
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.220]   and they share it with the rest of everybody.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.340]   And that person shared it,
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.700]   but all of us were interested on like,
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.820]   man, this tells more of the story
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.100]   of who we are and how we got here.
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.780]   As we kick off this series on bloodline,
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.860]   our hope is as we explore the bloodline of Jesus
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.620]   and trace through the central story
[00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.780]   of the Old Testament Bible,
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.300]   it's gonna give not just an indication
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.620]   on who Jesus was and his lineage,
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.020]   but it'll give an indication of who we are
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.860]   and how we got here.
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.020]   In particular, the person that we're gonna look at tonight
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.860]   answers a lot around the question of who you are
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.020]   and how we, humanity, got here.
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.300]   We're gonna look at the story of Adam
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.720]   because inside of Adam's story,
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.820]   we don't just find the original start
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.020]   of the bloodline of Jesus,
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.100]   we find the original start of your bloodline
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.540]   and my bloodline.
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.260]   And in his story, we don't just see Adam's story,
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.180]   but we see all of our story.
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.900]   And so we're gonna look at tonight,
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.220]   God's first relationship and the first creation
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.540]   that existed on planet earth,
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.780]   which was Adam and his wife, Eve,
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.440]   and take away what we can learn from our original parents
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.660]   as it relates to who we are
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.460]   and how we got here and our world got here.
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.580]   What we're gonna explore tonight
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.540]   is some of the most profound teachings in the entire Bible.
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.580]   They provide the explanation
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.340]   for everything broken in our world,
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.560]   everything broken out there and everything broken in here.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.540]   They provide the explanation
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.340]   for why is there school shootings?
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.400]   Why does evil exist at all?
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.500]   Why does everything wear out and break down
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.400]   and nothing lasts, including me and you?
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.740]   Why am I so drawn back to the same temptations,
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.620]   the same sin struggles, those old relationships,
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.880]   the same lustful thoughts?
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.760]   Like, what is that?
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.760]   Why is it that like I can continue to follow Jesus
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.120]   and it's never like, oh, I put that to bed
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.440]   and that's all forever behind me?
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.140]   And not that there's not victory and growth and faith,
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.340]   but there's something that just continues
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.500]   to be the presence of sin doesn't go away.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.620]   Why is that?
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.580]   Why do I find myself still anxious?
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.820]   Tonight, we're gonna look at not just how we got here,
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.700]   but the solution for those things.
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.860]   And we're gonna trace through the original starting point
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.580]   in the bloodline of Jesus and in the bloodline of you.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.740]   So we're gonna be in Genesis chapter one.
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.940]   If you have a Bible, you can book open in Genesis chapter one.
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.460]   Genesis is the book of beginnings.
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.160]   And in it, we are given in chapter one,
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.020]   kind of a 30,000 foot view of creation of man
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.540]   and in chapter two, a on the ground level, more specific.
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.880]   So I'm gonna start in verse one,
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.500]   we're gonna look at creation,
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.220]   what happened through temptation
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.340]   and how that same thing is continuing to happen
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.020]   in your life and my life.
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.540]   And then some of the solution that God has provided
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.380]   to do with that.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.780]   So verse 26 of chapter one, this will be on the screen.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.900]   If you don't have a Bible, if you're in Dallas,
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.180]   there are Bibles in the Welcome Center.
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.540]   That is our gift to you.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.760]   You could take one of those any week.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.560]   And if not, there's an app out there.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.400]   So download that.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.080]   Okay, verse 26 of chapter one.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.200]   Then God said,
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:55.080]   "Let us make mankind in our own image, us,
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.160]   "and in our likeness,
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.680]   "that they may rule over the fish of the sea
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.300]   "and the birds of the air and over the livestock
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.400]   "and all the wild animals and over all the creatures
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.280]   "that move over the ground."
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.660]   So God created mankind in his own image.
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.900]   In the image of God, he created them,
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.740]   both male and female.
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.940]   Unique from all creation,
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.900]   he makes humankind in the image of God.
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.740]   I'm gonna come back to why it says, "Let us,"
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.580]   here in a second.
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.500]   But then in chapter two, it goes into more specifics.
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.420]   Then the Lord God formed man,
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.300]   and it tells how he created Adam
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.020]   and further, how he created Eve.
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.360]   He formed him from the dust of the ground,
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.800]   and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life,
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.260]   and the man became a living being.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.080]   The word man is the same word for Adam.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.840]   That's literally the translation of what it means.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.440]   And God uniquely creates him among all creation.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.360]   Everything else, he just speaks into existence.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.700]   He says, "Let there be light, light.
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.600]   "Let there be trees, trees."
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.320]   But uniquely, with man, he forms him out of the dirt
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.640]   and breathes into him.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.800]   It's incredibly intimate
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.960]   and distinct from everything else created.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.900]   It's how God sees you and sees humanity,
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.400]   distinct from all else that is created.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.340]   Verse 16, "And God puts him in the garden of Eden,"
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.860]   which is, Eden means delight.
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.660]   "And the Lord God commanded the man,
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.660]   "you are free to eat from any tree in the garden.
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.580]   "But you must not eat from the tree
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.200]   "of the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.720]   "For when you eat of it, you will surely die."
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.640]   So God says, "Hey, you can eat from any tree in the garden,
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.960]   "except for that one tree,
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.040]   "because on that day, you're gonna do it,
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.580]   "there's gonna be consequences, you're gonna die.
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.840]   "Don't eat from that one tree."
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.820]   And a second, I'm gonna answer,
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.160]   'cause you may be wondering or have wondered,
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.780]   like, why did God even put that tree there?
[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.420]   Why don't we just get rid of that tree?
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.280]   No problem.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.240]   And I'm gonna answer that in a second.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.320]   But first, I wanna highlight,
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.480]   think about what God just did.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.600]   He takes man, forms him,
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.000]   places him in a garden called delight or in paradise.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.480]   And he literally says, "Hey, guys,
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.460]   "you can do whatever you want.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.400]   "You got one rule."
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.840]   This is the entire Bible at this point.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.040]   Don't eat the tree.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.520]   You could fit the entire Bible, don't eat from the tree.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.040]   You could fit all of it on an index card.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:06.860]   That was it.
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.240]   Everything else, fair game, you do you,
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.040]   do whatever you wanna do, just don't eat from the tree.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.920]   That was the Bible.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.000]   That was all that God gave.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.240]   The focus and really the takeaway is he says, "You are free
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.080]   "to eat from anything that's out there."
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.400]   And he gave this one instruction,
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.860]   and I'm gonna point back to why he did that.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.460]   Then verse 18.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.460]   "Then the Lord said,
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.440]   "It is not good for man to be alone."
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.720]   At this time, it was only Adam.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.840]   "I will make a helper suitable for him.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.040]   "Before sin had ever entered into the world,"
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.080]   God says over and over in the Genesis account,
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.280]   he's like, "It's good.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.560]   "There was light, and it was good.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.240]   "There was stars and moon, and it was good.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.080]   "Everything was good."
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.200]   And then he comes to one thing
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.700]   before sin was ever present, and he says,
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.500]   "There's one thing that's not good.
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:56.300]   "So the Lord caused the man to fall into a deep sleep.
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.900]   "And while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.600]   "and then closed them up in a place with flesh.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.500]   "And the Lord God made a woman,"
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.600]   thank you, Lord, "from the rib
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.780]   "he had taken out of the man.
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.280]   "And he brought her to the man."
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.400]   In verse 23, we're told Adam busts out in song,
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.900]   and it's his very own version of Brian McKnight's
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.920]   ♪ One, you're like a dream come true ♪
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.660]   And this couple is made for each other.
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.640]   I mean, it's true, you read it,
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.860]   where he's like, "This girl is mine.
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.880]   "She was made for me.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.200]   "Just wanna be with you.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.560]   "You're the only one for me."
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.720]   And it was true.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.220]   And Adam and Eve were both naked, and they felt no shame.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.360]   They had perfect harmony and perfect relationship
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.000]   with one another and with God.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.720]   We have never known a world
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.100]   that does not exist without shame.
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.040]   It's been a part of everything
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.280]   and every experience in all of our life.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.880]   But they lived in a perfect relationship,
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.600]   in a way that they experienced total intimacy with God,
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.360]   with one another, no division.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.360]   They spent time face-to-face with God, walking with him,
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.400]   consistently in deep relationship with God.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.640]   They were created to.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.120]   The first idea that still is true about you and me,
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.680]   that we learn from just the story of our ancient parents,
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.220]   is that you were created for connection, for relationships.
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.160]   You were created to exist in relationships.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.200]   That's the first thing I wanna harp on.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.180]   And that may go like, "Oh, yeah, I get that.
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.440]   "But here's why that's so profound, so stay with me."
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.440]   You were made in the image of a Trinity God.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.680]   You know that?
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.760]   Like, why does he say, "Let us"?
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.460]   It's kind of a weird thing to say.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.960]   Unless there's more than one of them.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.920]   And let me be really careful on this.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.920]   The Bible teaches that there's something called the Trinity.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.200]   It is one God and three persons.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.560]   Father, Son, Holy Spirit, eternally existed all time.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.840]   You may be going, "What?
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.800]   "How does that make sense?"
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   It's a little bit beyond my pay grade to fully explain,
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.080]   or any human to fully explain.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.420]   In fact, there was a church father who said,
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.500]   "Hey, if you deny the Trinity, you will forfeit your soul.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.100]   "If you try to explain the Trinity,
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.400]   "you will lose your mind."
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.240]   So. (audience laughing)
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.640]   But over and over, the Bible says that God,
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.680]   eternally existed in relationship,
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.720]   perfect relationship with one another.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.320]   Father, Son, Holy Spirit, totally together.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.600]   And when he made God, he said,
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.240]   "Let us make him in our image."
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.640]   This three-in-one God.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:14.600]   He made man in the image of a eternal, relational God.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.960]   By definition and by design,
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.700]   you were created for relationship,
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.560]   for connection with other people.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.260]   That's why the very first thing that God can say is,
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.900]   "Hey, it's not good that they would be alone.
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.840]   "You were designed and created to connect
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.740]   "with other people, specifically with God,
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.760]   "with others in your life."
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.160]   And here's why this matters.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.420]   Whether or not you realize it,
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.800]   you are going to seek to connect with other people.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.240]   You're gonna seek to connect with someone or something,
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.600]   and so it's not a question of whether or not,
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.920]   like you were designed for connection,
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.320]   and you're gonna do that in neutral
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.480]   whether or not you try to.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.480]   You're gonna do it, we all of us.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.920]   All of us are, you know, desire affection.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.140]   We desire affirmation, we desire relationships,
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.340]   so you are going to seek it.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.500]   It's not optional whether or not
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.580]   you're gonna seek connection with others.
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.980]   It is optional where you seek connection with others.
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.380]   It's like this, like in my home,
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.900]   we've got Wi-Fi, and the Wi-Fi doesn't go upstairs,
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.220]   so I bought a Wi-Fi extender at Best Buy,
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.420]   thinking this will be great.
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.200]   It'll take the Wi-Fi, it'll extend it upstairs,
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.040]   and it's pretty cool.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.060]   So you plug it into the wall,
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.140]   and whatever your Wi-Fi is, so mine's Marvin's Wi-Fi,
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.500]   it takes that, and it basically puts an EXT on there.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.920]   So when you go to like on your phone,
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.240]   put in connect to Wi-Fi, it just says,
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.680]   "Marvin's Wi-Fi EXT," for extender.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.880]   So I would go, and I'd logged on,
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.160]   and because, I don't know where I even bought this thing,
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.960]   but it clearly wasn't a very effective place,
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.800]   it's never worked ever.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.560]   So I would go connect to my Wi-Fi,
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.720]   and it would not allow me to connect to the internet,
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.840]   or it would be really slow, or it would stop,
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.200]   and so my phone would automatically connect,
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.880]   'cause that's what it does once you log in a couple times,
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.600]   it would automatically, when I walk into my house,
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.000]   connect to Marvin's EXT, which never worked,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.920]   because my phone is trained to connect to a router
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.920]   every time that it goes into that house.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.680]   And so what do I have to do?
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.800]   I have to go in, and I have to go,
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.760]   "Forget Marvin EXT, this was a total waste of money,
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.600]   "thank you, best buy," and I have to reconnect
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.600]   to Marvin's Wi-Fi.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.000]   In the same way, your heart,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   like a phone that is going to connect to a router
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.640]   when it goes in, is going to go in
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.480]   and seek to connect to other people,
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.240]   and so you don't have a choice over whether or not
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.640]   you're going to seek to connect,
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.560]   you do have a choice over who you connect with,
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.460]   through friendships, through dating relationships,
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.560]   through marriage, because your heart
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.720]   is going to seek to do that,
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.200]   so you have to be very intentional,
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.000]   just like in that scenario, where I go in,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.200]   and I have to choose, disconnect from this Wi-Fi
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.380]   that doesn't work, and connect with the right one.
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:48.120]   So you and I, as Christians, are called to be very careful
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.500]   about who we walk in deep relationship with.
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.900]   Some of you, you came in the room,
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.480]   and some of the greatest friends you have,
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.360]   and I'm not telling you that you should be mean to them,
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.440]   or rude to them, or any of them,
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.920]   but they are pulling you down,
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.200]   and you're trying to get traction as you walk with God,
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.560]   and you are connecting, and all of us
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.020]   are connection magnets, you are connecting with people
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.440]   who are gonna pull you away from God
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.660]   and pull you down in your faith.
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.480]   You don't have a choice over whether or not
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.000]   your heart is gonna look to connect
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.720]   and be in relationship with people.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.200]   You have a choice over who you allow to connect with,
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.120]   and some of us, the thing that is going
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.600]   to allow your faith to grow is you have to make the decision
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.360]   I am changing who I am walking in friendships with.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.840]   I'm not gonna be rude to people and just be like,
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.540]   oh, run the other way, but I am choosing
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.840]   who I'm going to allow speak and influence in my life,
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.240]   because my faith isn't strong enough right now,
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.520]   and these people are pulling me down,
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.800]   and I just keep getting blown up
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.920]   and getting pulled back into the same old stuff,
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.880]   and I'm choosing, I'm gonna change my playmates
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.680]   in my playgrounds, and I'm gonna choose
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.440]   to put myself around God's people.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.440]   You don't have a choice over the fact
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.680]   that you're going to seek to connect with other people.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.600]   You do have a choice over where you seek.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.480]   The same thing with dating and with marriage
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.880]   and with a spouse.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.080]   All of us are gonna seek that God-given desire
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.160]   that you have to seek out a spouse
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.800]   or to desire to have a husband or wife someday.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.000]   It's not something you need to be afraid of.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.760]   Like, dude, this weird thing happened in Christianity
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.120]   where it like crept into the church.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.480]   It's a bad thing for you to want a spouse.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.620]   I don't know where that happened or where that came from,
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.680]   but it's led to some really silly things
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.320]   where people feel like they have to pretend like,
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:22.800]   man, I don't think I'm supposed to want a husband or wife
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.040]   even though I do, so I'm just gonna say,
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.040]   God, I don't want a husband or wife even though I do,
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.720]   and that way you're gonna give me a husband or wife
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.560]   'cause then you will if I just say that I don't,
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.400]   and it's ridiculous.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.640]   The Bible says he who finds a wife finds a good thing
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.600]   and receives favor from the Lord.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.120]   It is a God, yeah, amen.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.260]   It is a God-given desire, and that's an okay thing.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.000]   It's not something ultimately any spouse can satisfy,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.920]   and you may not be able to choose,
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.160]   hey, whether or not I'm gonna desire to have a spouse,
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.940]   but you can choose where you are going to look
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.760]   to connect with one and who you disconnect from
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.900]   that, hey, you were trouble when you walked in.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.600]   We are over, and I'm disconnecting.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.080]   I'm deleting this number, and I'm cutting it off
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.680]   because you are gonna continue to be, as we've said before,
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.200]   with Mr. Right Now and never find Mr. Right
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.380]   because you're with Mr. Right Now,
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.880]   and you gotta choose, I'm disconnecting.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.480]   You were created to connect with God,
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.180]   not just with other people, but with God.
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.840]   Every single human heart is created to connect with God,
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.600]   and that is the answer to why so many people
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.400]   can have so much in life and still feel so empty.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.440]   It's why Tom Brady can sit and be like 49 years old
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.660]   going, hey, I've won 87 Super Bowls, and I'm still empty.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.360]   Go Pats.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.520]   It's why you can be married and have everything in life,
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.120]   and person after person could say, I've got it all,
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.980]   and it's not enough because there was something
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.020]   inside of them that was created to connect with God,
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.240]   and apart from a relationship with God,
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.320]   that connection is not being met.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.740]   You were created to experience relationship
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.340]   and connection with God.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.340]   It was true of Adam.
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.980]   It is still true today.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.260]   Why did God even put the tree there?
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:02.100]   That's a really fair question,
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.160]   and the answer is that the heart of God's desire
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.500]   would be a relationship with you.
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.340]   You know what you can't have without a,
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.620]   or you can't have a relationship without?
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.740]   Free will.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.380]   He didn't want robots who couldn't decide
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.480]   to walk with him or choose him,
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.640]   and he gave man free will, and in doing so,
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.780]   he gave them the option to choose him or to not,
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.180]   to choose to love him or to not,
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:27.760]   because he was designed and he wanted relationship.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.480]   You were designed and created for connection.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.500]   So Adam and Eve, they're hanging out in the garden,
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.220]   running around naked, hanging out with the animals.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.580]   Everything's perfect in paradise,
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.580]   and then like five minutes go by, and this is what happens.
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.660]   Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.620]   the Lord God had made, and he said to the woman,
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:57.100]   did God really say you must not eat
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.820]   from any tree in the garden?
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:59.720]   Okay, so let me hit pause,
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.820]   'cause if you didn't grow up in church,
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.140]   this is pretty weird of a story.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.760]   You're like, okay, they're hanging out,
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.900]   everyone's running around naked in the garden,
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.620]   things look so good, and then a snake
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.940]   starts talking to the lady.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.380]   That feels like unusual, not your everyday thing.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.900]   Here's what the serpent in this context.
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.180]   Biblically, repeatedly, the serpent represents Satan.
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.540]   In Revelation chapter 12, we're told that the ancient dragon,
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.120]   that ancient serpent called the devil,
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.500]   who was there at the beginning,
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.580]   that over and over, that Satan essentially
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.740]   is disguising himself here in the form of a serpent
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.300]   to come and tempt, and that may seem bizarre and weird,
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.820]   but it has been consistently used as the title
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.060]   or a way that Satan disguises and masks himself.
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.860]   So he shows up, begins to speak, and speak lies to Eve.
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.100]   Here's what happens next.
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.100]   The woman said to the serpent,
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.420]   we may eat from the trees in the garden,
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.120]   or we may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.420]   but God did say you must not eat from the tree
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.980]   that is in the middle of the garden,
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.740]   and that you must not touch it, or you will die.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.220]   I don't even have time to go into all of this,
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.620]   but Eve added to God's word.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.000]   He didn't say you can't touch it.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.740]   She said you shouldn't eat from it.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:10.900]   You will certainly not die, said the serpent,
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.300]   for God knows that when you eat it,
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:18.060]   your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God,
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.460]   knowing good and evil.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:24.660]   And the original lie, and the lie that ever since
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.420]   it was bought has been breathed into every single
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.280]   human heart, including mine and including yours,
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.100]   was sold and told to Eve.
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.940]   What was the original lie?
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.940]   The original lie was essentially that if you listen to God,
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.040]   you're gonna miss out.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.660]   Hey, if you listen and you follow God,
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.740]   and you actually do it, God is holding back from you.
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.660]   You know that, right?
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.060]   Like if you actually do what God says,
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.500]   like you're gonna miss out on life,
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.940]   you should do what you want,
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.540]   and you should do what you think is best.
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.860]   If you actually follow God, he's holding out.
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:52.940]   He's not that good.
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.500]   He's not for your good.
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:58.660]   And what he says, you know, take it or leave it.
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:02.500]   In Eve verse six, when the woman saw that the fruit
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.620]   of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye,
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.500]   and desirable for gaining wisdom,
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.940]   she took some of it and ate it.
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:16.660]   She also gave some to her husband who was with her.
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:17.500]   What?
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.260]   And he ate it.
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.020]   Adam was there, and he was silent.
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:28.060]   And he failed his wife, and he failed to speak up.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.460]   And he failed to stop the lies with the truth.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.980]   The thing I wanna focus on is really what happens
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.140]   every time temptation exists in my life and in your life,
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:38.980]   and that is this.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.100]   Every time temptation exists,
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.740]   it calls God's word and words into question.
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.380]   Every time, and let me unpack this,
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.700]   'cause this is so, so important that you understand.
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:47.980]   And that may just be like, oh yeah,
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:48.940]   it calls God's word into question.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.380]   That feels so irrelevant for my life.
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.480]   Let me try to unpack it here for a second.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.780]   The first thing we see is that the serpent
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.220]   does something really interesting
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.340]   that I never noticed until somebody pointed out this week.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:03.580]   He goes through and he changes
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.180]   the descriptive title for God.
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.580]   Prior to that, every single time that God is mentioned,
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.460]   it is the Lord God, or Yahweh Elohim.
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.740]   That's the words Lord and God in Hebrew.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.340]   Lord was a personal title.
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.100]   God would be kind of like distant, like man,
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.980]   and Yahweh would be my man, if you will.
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.860]   And he changes it in the serpent every single time.
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.460]   He says, did God say, did God say,
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.620]   not did the Lord God say.
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.900]   In fact, I think we have a slide
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.580]   where here we see all the different times in chapter two,
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.780]   put it back there, all the different times in chapter two
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.020]   where we see the Lord God, Lord God,
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.220]   and then there's so many more of them.
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.660]   You can go back and look.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.740]   Where the Lord God, Yahweh Elohim, Lord God,
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.580]   this relational aspect.
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.380]   And then Satan comes up and he says, did God,
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.900]   and every time he mentions him, he says God.
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:45.820]   He says God.
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.500]   He removes the relational component from them,
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.140]   beginning to get them to question.
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.820]   This is not some personal God who cares about you.
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.860]   It's some distant force that just wants to him
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.860]   and rule you in.
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.860]   He's not really that good, and he's not really that for you.
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:05.260]   Every time that you and I fall for a temptation,
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.420]   it comes with us believing a lie
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:12.280]   or calling into question God's word and his goodness.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.060]   But here's like how it happens for you and for me.
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.860]   It doesn't normally, even though our temptation
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.160]   is a parallel for this scenario,
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.700]   it's not typically that it goes down like this.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.540]   In other words, the temptation that you fall for
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.460]   is not generally you're gonna walk out of here
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.740]   and you're gonna be sitting in your car,
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.780]   and then all of a sudden there's gonna be a snake pop up,
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.020]   and he's gonna be like, hey, you know what?
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:28.880]   You shouldn't do that.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.940]   You should do this over here, and you're gonna be like,
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.820]   oh man, did God really say I guess that I'll do that?
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.180]   And he's gonna be like, yeah, eat this apple.
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.920]   And that's generally not what happens.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.840]   It's not on the surface as clear as that,
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.620]   but every time that you and I begin to go,
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.700]   man, is God really that good?
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.840]   Maybe doing what God says is like,
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.460]   you know, it's a big deal when I grow up someday
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.460]   or I kinda like get settled down,
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.660]   but right now in life, you know,
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.420]   it's just not that big of a deal,
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.540]   and that is what it looks like
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:55.700]   for you to begin to call into question,
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.460]   like, man, God says not to do this.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.100]   He says this is how you think about sexuality,
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.180]   about money, about life, all these things.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:06.500]   And then we attempt to begin to justify in our own mind
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.560]   why, you know, I'm sure that's really good,
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.260]   but just one time, is it that big of a deal?
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.100]   And in doing so, we are doing exactly
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.620]   what Eve was tempted to do,
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.800]   question whether or not God and his word is true,
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.680]   and he's as good as he says he is, every single time.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.020]   So it may look like, hey, you know,
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.460]   the Bible says don't get drunk on wine,
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.020]   that leads to reckless living,
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.140]   and if we're just like justification factories,
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:30.980]   we'll be beginning to go like,
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.100]   oh, man, this is why it's not exactly that,
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.580]   you know, and we just look for the ability
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.740]   to do what we want to do,
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.060]   and we're doing exactly what Eve did.
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:38.900]   What do I mean?
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:39.820]   You know, don't get drunk on wine,
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:40.780]   that leads to reckless living,
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.900]   and we're like, dude, it says don't get drunk on wine.
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.100]   It was beer, and it was Patron,
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.420]   and it's not that big of a deal,
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.980]   and what even is drunk?
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.500]   I mean, I'm gonna take an Uber either way,
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.300]   and so like, where do you define drunk?
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.620]   Like the state of Texas, or, you know,
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.500]   it's not like I passed out,
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.180]   and it was my 25th birthday, okay?
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.060]   Get off my back, and we just begin to justify it,
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.380]   and justify it, or God says, you know,
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.900]   don't have a hint of sexual immorality named among you,
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.280]   and we take that, and we're like, hey, dude,
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.300]   it's okay if I, you know, spend the night
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.060]   at my boyfriend's house and my girlfriend's house.
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.740]   It's not like we're having sex.
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.260]   There's a lot of people doing a lot of things worse.
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.140]   In fact, you know what?
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.080]   I feel like I should get a trophy or something,
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.180]   because I'm really, you know, standing out.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.300]   Everybody else is sleeping around.
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.340]   We're just sleeping together and not having sex,
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:28.980]   and we're seeking to justify our behavior.
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:32.420]   Man, I'm chasing a hashtag, or I'm looking at pornography,
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.420]   but that's not that bad.
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.720]   It's, you know, a lot of people out there
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.180]   are having sex with other people,
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.660]   and this is way not as bad as that,
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.700]   and we just begin to buy this idea that, man,
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.100]   it's not that big of a deal.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.600]   It's not that applicable to me,
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.060]   and I'm justified in my actions,
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.100]   and in doing so, it's calling what God's word says
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.740]   into question, for me, for you, every single time.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:56.580]   Any of us do it.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.180]   The interesting thing about this text,
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.980]   or about Satan's offense, which is the devil
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.500]   and just kind of the way that sins work,
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.580]   he doesn't say, hey, Eve, here's the deal.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.020]   Eat that apple and follow me.
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:10.860]   Let's go.
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:11.680]   He'd be like a devil worshiper.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.980]   We're gonna give you a hat, some horns and things.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.140]   You'd be my follower.
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:14.980]   He doesn't say that.
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:15.800]   Like, think about this.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.180]   Pretty profound.
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.040]   Satan never works like that.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.020]   What does he say?
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.860]   He says, follow you.
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.060]   His offense every single time is not,
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.380]   hey, come follow me.
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.460]   We're gonna start a cult.
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.100]   His offense, this is how Satan works every time.
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.420]   It's how he works all over our world,
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.420]   is not, hey, follow him.
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.040]   It's follow you.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.500]   Follow what you desire.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.380]   You should do what you want.
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.000]   All over the message of our world is like,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.960]   hey, you do you.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.280]   Nobody else can tell you anything,
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.220]   even if the Bible says it.
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.820]   Hey, I'm a Christian, and yeah,
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.580]   a lot of Christians have sex outside of marriage,
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.460]   and that's not that big of a deal,
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:51.820]   and, oh, who are you to judge me over here?
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:52.700]   Look at you.
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.820]   I'm sure you've done some bad things in your life, too,
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.380]   and you buy and you justify,
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.620]   and you tell yourself what you're doing
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.260]   is not that big of a deal, and it's okay,
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.940]   and you know God out there, and God still loves me.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:01.900]   I had sex in a windmill.
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.660]   It don't matter, and you do whatever you want,
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.500]   and what is at the heart of that lie?
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:10.100]   I can do whatever I want, and Satan's winning.
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.020]   His offense is always not, hey, follow me.
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.580]   It's follow what you want.
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.760]   Is there a lie that is more prolific
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.360]   in our culture today than that?
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.500]   You know what the motto of the Church of Satan is?
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.720]   Do as thou wilt.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.000]   Do as thou wishes.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.320]   Wilt's just a weird, old word that means want.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.620]   The motto of the Church of Satan is not,
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.460]   hey, let's just burn Bibles and do Wicca.
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.300]   It's Ouija boards.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.460]   Wicca, is that a thing?
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.700]   The motto is do whatever you want,
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.380]   and his offense has not changed.
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.740]   Anytime that you and I begin to go like,
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.740]   man, I think I deserve this, I think it's okay,
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.040]   and begin to excuse our actions,
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.500]   despite the fact that they don't align with God's Word,
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.220]   we should be concerned.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.700]   I know for me, anytime that I justify,
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.580]   like man, I'm just, and I'm entertaining
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.160]   lustful thoughts in my head from past relationships,
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.120]   and I'm like, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.860]   I'm justifying sin, and I'm falling,
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.220]   and I'm not believing God is what he says and who he says.
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.740]   Anytime that I allow anxiety to rule over me,
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.380]   and I'm just like, you know, God's Word,
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.460]   it really doesn't apply here,
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.540]   I am allowing temptation to lead me to say
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.040]   God's Word is not as good as he says.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.420]   Anytime I'm blaming other people,
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.500]   I'm focusing on what I'm entitled to that I don't have,
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.920]   I'm buying into temptation,
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.380]   and not taking God's Word.
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.580]   I'm calling into question God, and who he says that he is.
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.720]   I think a lot of us, and I'll move on to the last point,
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:47.480]   we bought this idea that I think is why Satan
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.640]   doesn't say Lord God, like he doesn't say like,
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.920]   man, your God, and relation to God, and Lord God.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.280]   He says just the God, like God who's out there.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.320]   Tries to make him impersonal, not connected,
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.280]   and you know, who knows, does he even care about you?
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.640]   He just gave these random rules.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.960]   We think of God and the instructions he gives us
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.600]   in the Bible not as like a loving father
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.740]   giving things to protect you and to keep you from harm.
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.280]   We think of him as like, just like, you know,
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.080]   some distant government who gives
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.480]   some random arbitrary rules, and I know, at least for me,
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:21.240]   it can seem like laws, like sinning against God
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.480]   is kind of like speeding.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.060]   It's like I'm driving in the neighborhood,
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.960]   and it's 60 miles an hour, and then at this point,
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.240]   it changes to 75 miles an hour, and I'm like, dude,
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.160]   who decided that, you know, between these 40 feet,
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.920]   it makes sense, and it's okay to go up 15 miles an hour,
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:38.440]   because whoever did just cost me a speeding ticket of $300.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.880]   This just feels ridiculous.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.000]   I don't even feel bad.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.160]   I don't even know if I should say this.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.200]   In fact, I'm already there, so let's just go.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.920]   I don't even feel bad when I'm speeding.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.000]   I can convince myself that, man, it's not that big of a deal,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.180]   'cause it's some distant government out there,
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.400]   and don't email me, I know.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.160]   I choose not to speed.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.320]   I try not to.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.160]   Let's move on.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.440]   My point is this.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.680]   It feels like, man, this distant law,
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.020]   I don't even know who set these rules.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.300]   I never agreed to 'em.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.520]   Do they even care about me?
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.040]   And they don't feel like they're really after anything
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.540]   other than a speed trap, trying to get me trapped.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:17.600]   I think a lot of us think like that about God.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.320]   It's just some random, arbitrary rules,
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.200]   and it's not that big of a deal,
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.080]   and hey, you know, if you go 70 in a 65,
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.840]   as long as you don't get caught, it's all good.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.900]   And the Bible says it's not like
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.580]   some random, arbitrary government law.
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.560]   It is like a father who loves his children,
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.920]   who says, "I'm putting these in place,
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.560]   "not to restrict you, not to hold you back,
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.400]   "'cause I love you."
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.960]   And every time I say do not, it is do not hurt yourself.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.400]   It's like my son, I have a three, almost four-year-old son,
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.300]   and one of the key laws in our home
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.280]   that he does not do great, always et al bang,
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.680]   is running into the street.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.520]   And he sits there, and he's like, you know,
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.640]   all pumped up on Halloween candy lately,
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.320]   and he's like, just gravitational pull,
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.540]   he's out into the street.
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.660]   And he has a father and mother who give him spanking,
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.360]   saying, "Do not run in the street."
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.180]   Why?
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.020]   It's because we're like, dude,
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.520]   the street is where the party at.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.040]   That, and we wanna keep that away from you?
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.460]   That, that's what we want?
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.920]   No, it's because there's cars,
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.020]   and you could get hurt, and you could die.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.880]   But to him, he's like, dude, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.920]   And sometimes, you know, I've even stepped into the street,
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.960]   and nothing's happened.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.360]   I don't know if they really are for my good,
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.200]   and this just feels random,
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.920]   and they're keeping me from where the party at.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.780]   And, (laughs)
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.520]   I'm just gonna do that like five more times.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.440]   (audience laughs)
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.560]   Here's the crazy thing, though.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.560]   You're listening, and you're like,
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.560]   oh, those are totally different.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.740]   A speed trap?
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:33.320]   60 in 75, that's such an arbitrary law,
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.240]   or 60 down to 40, or whatever it is.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.740]   That's so different from a loving, heavenly father
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.480]   who has the best of his child in mind,
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.400]   and cares about him,
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.320]   and gives him instruction to protect him.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.440]   You could see the difference.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.700]   You know who can't?
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.000]   My four-year-old son.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.960]   He just thinks, man, this guy's,
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.680]   is he just trying to withhold me from me?
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.000]   'Cause he doesn't have the perspective
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.240]   and maturity to see that.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.680]   Every single law that God has given,
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.080]   whether or not you have the perspective
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.240]   and maturity to see it,
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.240]   is not to rip you off and constrain you,
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.960]   but from a God who loves you
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.360]   far more than I love my son.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.900]   And I can't even put into words how much I love my son.
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:16.940]   And everything that he's given is to protect you.
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.100]   And temptation always comes
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:21.380]   when we begin to question God in our life.
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.100]   So Adam was created for relationship.
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.660]   He deceived and disobeyed,
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.940]   and Eve did, and called God into question.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.100]   And everything changed.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.300]   Here's what happened, verse seven.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.960]   Then the eyes of both of them, Adam and Eve, were opened.
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.420]   And they realized that they were naked.
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:44.060]   So they sewed fig leaves together,
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.820]   and they made coverings for themselves.
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:50.300]   In a moment, shame enters, insecurity enters, fear enters.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.460]   Everything changed.
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:52.420]   Death entered.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:58.300]   Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.100]   as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.300]   Most scholars believe this was the pre-incarnate Christ,
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.860]   which it's hard to kind of fathom.
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.620]   It's basically the before Christ came,
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.060]   and was born 2,000 years ago,
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.200]   he appeared and was walking in the garden.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:19.660]   Because it says God was clearly walking in bodily form.
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:20.740]   And he's walking in,
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:24.380]   and he'd walked tons of times with these guys.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.220]   He walked every day.
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.340]   I mean, they saw God face to face.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.300]   Adam and Eve had perfect harmony together,
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.780]   perfect relationship with him.
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.380]   I mean, they existed, and they loved each other,
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.020]   and looked forward to the moments
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.740]   they got to be around their God, the Lord God.
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.540]   And he was around, and he walked.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:42.500]   And this day, everything changed.
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:46.020]   And they hear him walking,
[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.020]   a sound they'd heard before,
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.780]   and instead of running towards God,
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.220]   it says this.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:54.020]   And they hid.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.580]   When they heard the Lord God walking,
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.580]   they hid from the Lord God
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.900]   from among the trees of the garden.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.500]   And the Lord called out to the man, "Where are you?"
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.380]   And he said, "I heard you in the garden,
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.540]   "and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid."
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:15.660]   I can only imagine the pain of this moment.
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:20.220]   And I'm not gonna spend a lot of time here,
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.300]   'cause we've got just to finish the text.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.980]   If you're God,
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.460]   and you'd only ever known this perfect relationship,
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:28.420]   and you're Adam and you're Eve,
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:31.300]   and there's perfect harmony with one another,
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.020]   and you're walking up,
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:33.980]   and all of a sudden, what used to be,
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.660]   you run towards God when you hear him walking towards you,
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.420]   all of a sudden, because of their decision,
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.580]   because shame entered,
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.660]   they turn off and they run away from God.
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.900]   As I think about that,
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.260]   you know what would break my heart so much?
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:50.220]   If my kids, whenever I showed up at my house,
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.500]   right now, every single day that I show up,
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:55.180]   they run in, "Daddy," and it hugs at the door.
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.660]   It would be similar to, instead of that happening,
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.620]   if I showed up at my house,
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:59.940]   and they heard Daddy coming,
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.740]   and they took off, and they saw me,
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.900]   and they ran and hid.
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.580]   I know most of us aren't parents in the room,
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.620]   but the emotional response can almost bring me to tears,
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:09.860]   even thinking about that.
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.940]   Now, for a perfect God,
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.260]   who loved Adam and Eve so much that years later,
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.880]   he would give his son to die in their place,
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.180]   to see his children, when his presence come,
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:21.860]   take off, and in fear, run from him.
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:23.220]   Everything was fractured.
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.300]   And as painful as the decision to disobey,
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.540]   how even more painful
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.020]   was how that decision to disobey
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.640]   led them to run from God in shame.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:38.260]   And God said to Adam, "Who told you that you were naked?
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.140]   "Have you eaten from the tree from which I have commanded
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.060]   "you not to eat from?"
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:45.500]   And the man said, "The woman you put here.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:50.720]   "She gave me some of that fruit, and I ate it."
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.880]   And the Lord God said to the woman,
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.260]   "What is this that you have done?"
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:37:00.260]   And the woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:03.660]   And a blame game begins, and Adam essentially goes like,
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.140]   "Man, the woman that you gave,
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.020]   "so basically this is your fault, so you guys figure it out."
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.580]   And the woman says, "It was his fault."
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.340]   And sin was introduced, and everything broke,
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.040]   and everything fractured.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.060]   And then God, in verses 14 through 20,
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.900]   says these are the curses God gives Adam.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.500]   Hey, now you're gonna work the ground,
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.060]   and it's gonna war against you.
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:27.700]   Work will not be life-giving, it will war against you,
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:31.580]   and Eve, childbirth, will be painful.
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:36.860]   And miscarriage, and all the brokenness around giving birth
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.740]   will no longer be what it was intended to be.
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.740]   And your desire will be to rule over your husband,
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:42.860]   or to get something from your husband
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.940]   that he cannot give to you.
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:48.660]   And he lays out to the serpent, and this will be your curse.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.060]   And then I want you to see what God does next.
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:56.060]   "Then the Lord God made garments of skin,"
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:01.100]   that's cloth, or fur, a sacrifice was made.
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:05.340]   "And he made them for Adam and his wife,
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.560]   "and he clothed them.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.200]   "And the Lord God said,
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.800]   "The man has now become like one of us,
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.420]   "knowing good and evil.
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:17.180]   "Previously he had only known good.
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:20.960]   "And he must not be allowed to reach out his hand
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.900]   "and also take the tree of life and eat it,
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:23.740]   "and live forever."
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:26.920]   So God gives provision of clothing and protection.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.580]   Why do I say that?
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.740]   Had Adam been able to reach out and eat of the tree of life,
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.900]   essentially he would have been able to live forever in sin.
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.980]   He would have experienced living hell quite literally,
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:35.820]   eternally.
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.100]   And so even that is a protection of God,
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.160]   saying, "Hey, I'm gonna not allow him to eat from that tree."
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.980]   And they moved him out of the garden,
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.420]   and out Eve out of the garden,
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.300]   and they put there, an angel we're told,
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.180]   guarding the Garden of Eden, and the rest of the story.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.540]   But even that was an extension of God's grace.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.400]   Because he knew one day he would send a Savior
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:57.560]   to redeem and recreate and make all things new in this world.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.820]   But here's the thing that I wanna showcase
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.740]   or just highlight for just the last few minutes we have,
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.960]   is that sin always brings separation.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.180]   It always brings separation.
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.480]   It brings separation in your relationships with your parents.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.280]   It brings separation in your relationship with God.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.240]   It brings separation in my relationship with friends.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.440]   Anytime sin is present, it always drives in separation.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.280]   And so let me explain what I mean by that
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.520]   and why this is so huge.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:22.660]   Adam was not separated from God geographically
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:23.900]   immediately after he ate.
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:27.820]   He was separated from him relationally.
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.420]   Anytime sin is present,
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.900]   and because sin is present in our world,
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.380]   there is a relational gap that exists between you and I.
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:38.260]   Sin always brings in separation into you and I's life.
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.220]   We do the same exact thing, Adam, tragically.
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.740]   Like, it's so crazy how when we sin,
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.420]   it can drive us further
[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.620]   because of our shame and guilt into sin.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:48.420]   How many people, they give up their virginity,
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.220]   and it's like, dude, it doesn't even matter anymore.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.180]   I'm now able to have sex with,
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.100]   or I'm now willing to have sex with more people,
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:55.700]   and I don't hold it as tightly
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.220]   because, you know, I've already played that card.
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:59.740]   It's not that big of a deal,
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.140]   and I feel kind of a shame and guilt about it.
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.380]   And so I'll just like look for that as an opportunity
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.620]   to receive affection in a relationship.
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:10.020]   It's because they bought that initial line,
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.380]   and it drove us further and further and further.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:17.220]   Oftentimes, it's the process of how addiction just starts.
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:20.220]   Man, I'm so ashamed, and instead of running to God,
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:23.060]   I run from him further, and it builds my shame,
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:27.260]   and I grow more shameful and more afraid and more guilty.
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.420]   And the God who's there doesn't want you to run
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:31.900]   and try to hide and cover up.
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.940]   He says, "Come to me, bring it to me,
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:36.160]   "and I will clothe you in my righteousness."
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.660]   Just like here, there's a parallel.
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.020]   Don't cover it up, bring it to me,
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.460]   and I will clothe you like I clothed Adam and Eve
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.180]   with forgiveness and righteousness.
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.860]   You don't have to hide it,
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.560]   and you don't have to run from me.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:55.900]   The Bible says that on the day that they ate it,
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.060]   they would surely die.
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.300]   Now let me explain something really quick,
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.740]   just 'cause I've read that text before,
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:01.620]   and it's a really interesting thing.
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:04.260]   It's like, man, they didn't die that day, right?
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.740]   Like you can sometimes read, like the Bible says,
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:08.540]   hey, the wages of sin, Romans chapter three, is death.
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.380]   And so you sin, you get death.
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.620]   If you eat from the tree, you die.
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.400]   In James chapter one, it says that sin,
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.540]   when it's fully grown, brings forth death,
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.900]   and it can feel like, really, like I sinned?
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.100]   I feel like I sinned today, and I didn't die.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:21.940]   What is that?
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:22.760]   It's like this.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.460]   Any vets in the house?
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:25.860]   Good, no vets, okay.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:29.780]   My dog, he's not playing with a full deck,
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:32.860]   and he has on multiple occasions eaten grapes.
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.900]   And here's what I've learned as it relates to grapes.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.140]   Grapes will kill a dog.
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.400]   It will straight up put you in the ground,
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.340]   knock a sucker out.
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.380]   And this dog has eaten on multiple occasions.
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.220]   My wife has called me and been like,
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.580]   hey, the dog ate grapes.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.620]   And it becomes this decision where we're on like,
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.340]   you know, veterinary.com, trying to figure out,
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.100]   like, is this actually gonna kill him?
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.500]   And how much do we like the dog?
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:53.220]   And, because it's crazy, if they eat that fruit,
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.380]   it will straight up kill them.
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:57.020]   It'll like, it could shut down their kidneys,
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.060]   or so we've been told, and this could be
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:02.140]   just some hoax veterinarians are making a killing off of.
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.180]   And so we have to take him, get his stomach pumped,
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.540]   because in making that decision,
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.020]   if he eats those, and he digests them, it'll kill him.
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.980]   And sometimes it can feel like you read passages like this,
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:14.020]   and it's like, is it really gonna kill him?
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.820]   Like, sin is death, like, immediately, you know?
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:17.260]   Like, you know, I had sex outside of marriage,
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:19.020]   and I'm gonna die for that?
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:20.620]   It can feel like that's the message of the church.
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:22.380]   Hey, you smoke pot, you're gonna explode.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.100]   That's why you shouldn't do it.
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.820]   And then you do it, and you're like, I didn't explode.
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.540]   I don't understand, wages of sin is death?
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.300]   Sin always brings death?
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.740]   That feels a little aggressive.
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:33.740]   Let me explain what that means,
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.380]   because it's really important that you understand,
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.580]   or else you're gonna go, it's not that true.
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.820]   By sin, every time that there's sin,
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:42.860]   it brings death into our life.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.700]   What is death?
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:47.040]   The opposite of life.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.060]   Every time that sin is involved anywhere,
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:53.740]   it doesn't bring life in, it sucks life out of you.
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:57.980]   And eventually, that erodes and decays and leads to death.
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:02.520]   The erosion of relationships, death of relationships,
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.700]   can lead to death of your faith.
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.580]   But let me explain, like, it's not just like little death.
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.900]   And it is true that Adam and Eve,
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:08.540]   the moment you sin, they were on a clock.
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.740]   They started dying.
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.980]   The moment that you were born, you started dying.
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.860]   You get that, right?
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:16.300]   We're all continuing every second.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.820]   Eventually, it's just a slow death,
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:20.900]   because death entered into our world.
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:21.740]   But it wasn't just that.
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.740]   Sin also brings death to relationships.
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:28.740]   Some of you, like me, your parents' marriage died
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:33.700]   because of sin, whether it was selfishness,
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.520]   alcoholism, adultery.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:39.060]   And you saw the firsthand effects.
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:41.140]   Sin brings death.
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:43.180]   It brings death to your faith,
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.780]   and that you begin to make one decision after the next,
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:47.220]   like, people don't walk away from God overnight, generally.
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:48.620]   You know that?
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.460]   They just begin to go like,
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.020]   "Oh, man, I just started doing this,
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.140]   "and then I started doing this,
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:53.400]   "started hanging out with these people,
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.620]   "started making this relationship,
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:55.740]   "started living with him,
[00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:58.620]   "and then I'm not even sure I believe in this anymore."
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:04.100]   And slowly by slowly, their faith just died,
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:06.660]   because sin brings death every time that it's there.
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:10.060]   It can bring death, as we've seen, like someone's health.
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.000]   It can bring death of your freedom,
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:17.900]   because you hand in your freedom card for addiction,
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.540]   and you're, "Hey, I'm free to do whatever I want,"
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.960]   all of a sudden becomes,
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.460]   "I'm not free to do whatever I want anymore.
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.620]   "I can't stop."
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:28.700]   And death happened to your freedom.
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.420]   And the good news is,
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.700]   God brings dead things back to life all of the time,
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:34.640]   and the story's not over,
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.460]   but every time sin is introduced,
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:38.100]   it brings the opposite of life,
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:41.980]   which is dying, death, into the picture.
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.460]   More than anything,
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.100]   and let me highlight this as my third point,
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.040]   and then close.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.620]   I hope you hear me,
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:52.060]   and I think that this message in the church
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:56.180]   has been so lost and poorly communicated over the years.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:59.100]   God's concerned with you
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.580]   any time there's sin present in your life,
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:01.780]   and any time there's sin present in my life.
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.060]   According to the Bible,
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.040]   it's not him running, going,
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.140]   "I cannot believe you did that."
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:06.120]   I said, "No jumping in the street,
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.180]   "that's where the party's at."
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.980]   No, I don't want you to experience that,
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.340]   because I don't want you focused on that thing.
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:17.060]   His concern is about what that sin is doing to you.
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.180]   Every single time, it's like this.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.760]   My daughter, I took my son and my daughter
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.820]   this past weekend, we went to Home Depot,
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:25.260]   and they had this kids, sometimes on Saturdays,
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.940]   which you have to look forward to as a parent,
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.900]   Home Depot, here we go, and we're there,
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:30.460]   and they have these kids' workshops,
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:31.660]   you're building stuff,
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:34.980]   and you're building a plane or an eagle
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:35.980]   or something at the time,
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:37.300]   and I'm there, and we're building it,
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.300]   and they had popcorn that they were giving out
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.140]   to different kids,
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:41.820]   and my one-and-a-half-year-old daughter
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.420]   is like a hungry, hungry hippo in life.
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:46.340]   So she eats things that aren't even food.
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:47.700]   She's just like, "I'll take it."
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.420]   And she sees over this popcorn that's over on the floor,
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:54.380]   like just nasty popcorn over on the floor,
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:57.300]   and she's like, "Oh, man, look at that, snack, lunch."
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.820]   And my son is running off the other direction,
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.140]   and I'm all alone playing solo dad
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:03.300]   and just trying to chaos,
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.380]   and I'm regretting my decision
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:06.860]   to come to Home Depot entirely,
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.620]   and I'm yelling at him, "Stop going over there,"
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.780]   and then I look over here, and her name's Monroe,
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.140]   and I'm like, "Monroe, you do not eat that popcorn.
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:14.880]   "You do not eat that popcorn, Monroe.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.480]   "Do not eat, come back here.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.860]   "Someone, give me a ball of help."
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:21.100]   And she sits down, and she just plops down.
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.540]   She throws the popcorn in her mouth
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:24.340]   that's been sitting there who knows how long,
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:27.380]   and she begins to choke.
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.640]   And as a dad, you're like, "It's kind of terrifying.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.480]   "You're running over there."
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.420]   And this never happened before with her,
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:32.940]   and I pick her up, and she's choking,
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.260]   and not just kind of like, (coughing)
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.380]   I mean like color changing in her face,
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:37.740]   and I'm trying to push on her stomach
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:38.660]   and pat her on the back,
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:41.060]   and it was really a terrifying experience.
[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:44.820]   In that moment, do you know what I'm not concerned with?
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.820]   Her disobedience to eat the popcorn.
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.680]   I'm concerned about what her disobedience
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.580]   to eat the popcorn has done to her, and is doing to her.
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.020]   The God who's there is not there,
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.940]   out going like, "Man, I can't believe you made that decision,
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.580]   "and I'm just so angry at the fact that you would do."
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:01.220]   He's more concerned about what your decision,
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.580]   about what sin is doing to you,
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:05.340]   not about your sin, period.
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:09.780]   He's concerned about what it's going to do to you,
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:10.960]   like any father is not just going,
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.220]   "I can't believe, we're gonna sit here,
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:13.280]   "and you need to think about what you've done
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.520]   "with that popcorn, and the minute that you repent,
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.540]   "then we'll talk about you breathing again."
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:22.740]   And that's not what any sane parent would do, right?
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:23.700]   That's nuts.
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:26.620]   And my heart is going, "Man, I'm more concerned,
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:28.340]   "not about what she did, but about what she did,
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:29.940]   "and how it's impacting her now,
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:32.420]   "and what it's doing to her."
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:35.300]   Every time there's sin, that's the heart of God,
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:36.500]   'cause he moves in, not because he's like,
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.900]   "Man, I'm just here, I'm angry, and I can't believe."
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:41.180]   He's concerned about what it's doing to you and to me,
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.500]   because he's a father who loves and cares
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.660]   about his children.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:49.820]   The Bible says that, in conclusion,
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:52.020]   we were created for connection with God.
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.660]   Every time that you and I fall for temptation,
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:59.660]   it involves questioning, man, God's word and his way.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:03.860]   And ultimately, sin will always bring separation,
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:05.080]   it always has brought separation,
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.340]   but let me just focus on this last thing.
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.780]   I didn't read all the curses that were there,
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:10.540]   but in place of one of the curses,
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.820]   the Bible says that he looks at Adam,
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:14.260]   gives him a curse, Eve, curse,
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:15.460]   and then he goes to the serpent,
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.460]   who represents the devil, or Satan.
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.820]   And in the midst of his curse, God makes a promise
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:21.780]   that is the first foreshadowing
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:25.260]   of the bloodline to come, of Jesus.
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.060]   Here's what it says in verse 14 of chapter three.
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.440]   "Then the Lord said to the serpent,
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.020]   "Because you have done this,
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:34.760]   "cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.220]   "You will crawl on your belly,
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:38.600]   "and you will eat dust all the days of your life.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:43.300]   "I will put enmity, or war,
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:46.860]   "between you and the woman."
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:47.700]   The woman?
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:51.380]   "And her offspring and yours.
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:54.640]   "And he will crush your head,
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.420]   "and you will strike his heel."
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:57.340]   Why does he say the woman?
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:59.100]   It's foreshadowing of the virgin birth,
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:02.180]   that Jesus was on the planet, was born of a virgin.
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:03.620]   She didn't come from the lineage of Joseph,
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:04.780]   she came from Mary.
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:05.960]   And he says, "There's gonna be a descendant
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.000]   "that comes from the woman, from a woman,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.660]   "and he's gonna crush your head.
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:12.140]   "The victory will be final in his.
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.220]   "But you will bruise his heel,
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.480]   "and it will be through pain
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.180]   "that he will win the victory."
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.340]   And it's a foreshadowing of what Jesus
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:22.120]   would ultimately do on the cross,
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.920]   to finally and ultimately defeat and bring about
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.460]   all things good and redeemed in our world.
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:29.900]   Romans chapter five, the apostle Paul, years later,
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.340]   would write this about Jesus,
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.400]   and about Adam and their relationship together
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:36.140]   in the bloodline, and he would say this.
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:38.060]   In Romans chapter five, verse 12.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.260]   "When Adam sinned, sin entered the world,
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:42.020]   "and Adam's sin brought death."
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:44.480]   So when you sin, it introduced death.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.260]   "So death spread to everyone.
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:50.600]   "Now Adam," verse 14, "is a symbol
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:54.740]   "and a representation of Christ, who is yet to come.
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:59.300]   "But there is a great difference
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:02.380]   "between Adam's sin and God's gracious gift."
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.840]   That's Jesus and what he did.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:07.480]   "The sin of this one man, Adam, brought death to many.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:12.300]   "But even greater is God's wonderful grace
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:15.740]   "and the gift of forgiveness to many
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.920]   "through this other man, Jesus.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.160]   "And the result of this gracious gift
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.880]   "is very different from the result of Adam's sin,
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:25.160]   "for Adam's sin led to condemnation.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:28.780]   "But the free gift, free gift,
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:32.760]   "leads to being made right with God,
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.460]   "even though we are guilty of many sins."
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.580]   Paul basically says, hey, Adam and Jesus,
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.260]   they're like these, they have a similar thing going on.
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:39.580]   And he basically goes, hey, remember Adam,
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:42.260]   how he sinned and they like ruined it for everybody?
[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.340]   Jesus showed up, and his death on the cross,
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:48.420]   dying in a place, has offered grace and saving to everybody,
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.900]   that the Savior is stronger than the sinner.
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:52.420]   And Jesus has offered this free gift,
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:56.100]   and God came through on the promise that he made
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:58.540]   as early as the garden in the very first story
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:00.580]   of our parents, that I will one day crush
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:02.380]   and defeat sin and evil in this world.
[00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:04.360]   And everything broken points back to Adam.
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.780]   Everything in the world points back to Adam.
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:11.780]   And everything broken points forward to Jesus,
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:15.720]   or points to the need of this world for a Savior.
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.540]   Think about it.
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:23.460]   The challenge of a world without the message
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:25.380]   of the hope that Jesus brings
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:31.080]   is a world where you're left with nothing but questions.
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:34.980]   And the Bible says that the answer and the solution
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:36.820]   that God has given was paid for and proved
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:40.080]   by God coming in our place to die on a cross.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.580]   And I hope that you leave, and here's the message
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:42.980]   I just wanna leave you with.
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:48.940]   I've been in Lake Highlands, it's an area of Dallas,
[00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:50.540]   and it's kind of where we live, and the past year
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.180]   has been like a weird year in Dallas.
[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:53.900]   If you're not from here, you're not listening.
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:55.260]   It's just been like storm after storm,
[00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:57.140]   and it feels like, you know, there's a tornado
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:58.580]   that was really close to our house,
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:01.280]   and there were like trees that all kind of got knocked down
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:02.600]   this past summer, it's just been like crazy.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:03.440]   So what's happened?
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.800]   There's been a lot of sirens going off.
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:07.720]   And sometimes in my area of town, I'm like,
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:10.960]   man, is that an ambulance siren?
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:12.420]   Or is that a police car siren?
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:14.040]   Or what type of siren is that?
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.760]   And you're kind of waiting, and as it gets closer,
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:19.360]   you're able to tell, but those two elicit
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.200]   very different responses from us in life, don't they?
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.720]   Like a police siren, when you're on the road,
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.340]   and you're like, you know, driving along,
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:28.640]   and you hear a police siren, it creates a, oh no.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:29.920]   What, am I over the speed limit?
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.960]   Are they coming to get me?
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.160]   Versus if you're in a place where you're like
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.340]   in need of help, and you hear an ambulance siren,
[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:37.000]   you're not thinking, oh man, they're coming to get me.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.160]   You're thinking, they're coming to help me.
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:44.400]   The message of the Bible, and I need you to hear me,
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.360]   because some of you, I just want you to consider,
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:53.960]   could it be most of what you believe about God is not true?
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:56.540]   You think that he's a God that is out there,
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.100]   and he's coming to get you, and the message
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:00.340]   from every page, including the very first ones,
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:03.460]   is very early on, he's coming to help you.
[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.360]   And in this life, from the moment you breathe
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.340]   to the moment you die, that has always been
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:09.300]   the focus of God, and could it be?
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:10.760]   I just want you to consider.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.340]   You have bought a lie about what God is like,
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:15.960]   and every time you recoil in fear,
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.260]   every time you think God wouldn't want to have
[00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:20.460]   anything to do with me, you are living out the truth,
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.700]   or you are living out the lie that you have bought,
[00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.080]   that God doesn't actually come to do anything
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:28.740]   but get me, not help me, and the mercy of Christ
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.920]   and his heart for you, compassion towards you,
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.040]   is on every single page of the Bible.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.820]   What if everything you believe, what if so many things
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:38.520]   that you believe about God are wrong,
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.040]   and everything and every fear that you have,
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.560]   that if he really knew, if they really knew,
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.440]   if God really is there, he doesn't want to be with me,
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.760]   he doesn't want to know me, is a lie.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.160]   And I'm not gonna be able to convince you,
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.480]   and there's no story or anything that I could share
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.620]   that could, only God can do that.
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:58.480]   I just want to ask the question and ask you to consider,
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.060]   even if you could say I'm a believer,
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:02.600]   could it be that so many of the ways
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:06.080]   you think about God are not true?
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:09.780]   Because the Bible, this first story, Adam runs.
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:13.680]   God runs in towards him and says,
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.660]   I will take what you're covering up in your shame,
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:19.100]   and I'm gonna clothe you, and I promise I'm gonna save you,
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:20.940]   and I'm gonna save every person who will accept
[00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:23.220]   a free gift of grace, because the Savior
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.520]   is stronger than the sin and the sinner.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:29.140]   For anyone who will accept that free gift,
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:32.420]   could it be you've bought a lie
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:34.060]   about what God is really like?
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:37.860]   And my prayer is that as you study and you know God,
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.960]   and that God even right now in this moment,
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:43.300]   will move in your heart and woo you to know him
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:47.220]   in a unique way, in a way that's consistent
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:51.060]   with who he says that he is, and not recoil in shame
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:54.820]   and fear that it's true.
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:56.820]   Every word the Bible testifies it's true,
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:55:00.620]   that God loves you, and he's come for you,
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:04.300]   and he's coming for you, not to get you, but to help you.
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:05.140]   We pray.
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:07.940]   Father, thank you that every time
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:13.340]   we see you interact in our world
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.740]   through the person of Jesus in the New Testament,
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.900]   he reflects the character and the heart of a God
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:21.520]   who said, "I came to seek and to save the lost.
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:23.540]   "My heart is for a world that is sick
[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:24.860]   "and in need of a doctor."
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.780]   And so would you help us, Lord, to believe that?
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:30.100]   One of the greatest lies that we still believe today
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:32.340]   is the lie that Adam and Eve bought.
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:33.740]   God's really not that good.
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:36.420]   He really doesn't love you as much as he says he does.
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:37.500]   Would you help us, God?
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:40.780]   I need your help to believe that.
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:46.440]   And so in a room where thousands of us gather
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.700]   and listening on with thousands more,
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:49.940]   gather all through different places,
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:52.180]   we just invite and we ask for your help, God.
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:53.660]   Would you help us to believe,
[00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:56.160]   maybe believe again for a new and fresh way?
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.260]   You're a God who runs after those who run from you.
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.100]   You never stop.
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:03.060]   And you're chasing, and you're loving, and you're pursuing.
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:04.900]   We worship you now in song, amen.
