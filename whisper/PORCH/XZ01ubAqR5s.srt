1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,840
 - What's up, Porch?

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,900
 How we doing tonight?

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,760
 Hey, good to see you.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,160
 My name is Timothy Antique.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,180
 I'm one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,640
 on Sunday mornings as well as right here at the porch

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,780
 on Tuesday nights.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,120
 I wanna just say a welcome to everyone

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,880
 that is right here in the room in Dallas, Texas.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,800
 And then I also know that we have people watching

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,900
 all over the nation at various Porch Live locations.

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,720
 Just wanna say hello to Porch Live Tulsa,

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,720
 Porch Live Midland, Porch Live Indianapolis tonight.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,720
 I hope that all is well with you.

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,040
 And then I know that we have people all over the nation

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,360
 and world who are just tuning in by themselves

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,840
 in your apartment, in your condo,

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,060
 wherever you're at tonight.

20
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,760
 I'm glad that you are watching.

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,120
 Tonight is really a special night.

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,360
 It's an important night because we are going to talk

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,120
 about a really heavy subject.

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,500
 We're gonna talk tonight about suicide.

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,400
 And so I just wanna start by asking you,

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,380
 if you would just slip up your hand,

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,340
 if your life has ever been impacted by suicide.

28
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,780
 So I just want you to take a minute,

29
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,900
 I want you to look around

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,320
 and I want you to see the various hands raised

31
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,860
 that suicide has impacted a good majority

32
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,140
 of the room tonight.

33
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,180
 That's one of the reasons that I wanna step into it.

34
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,380
 Another reason that I wanna step into it

35
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,440
 is simply because statistics would show that young adults,

36
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,780
 that the percentage of people that have thought about suicide

37
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,060
 that have contemplated it or have activated on it

38
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,060
 is significant.

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,820
 So just to share some stats with you,

40
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,700
 suicide rates have increased by approximately 36%

41
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,700
 between 2000 and 2021.

42
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,740
 In 2021, which is really the most recent statistics,

43
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,660
 someone died by suicide about every 11 minutes

44
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,980
 here in the United States.

45
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:27,020
 In 2021, an estimated 12.3 million American adults

46
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,780
 seriously thought about suicide.

47
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,600
 Just think about that.

48
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,740
 12 million people seriously thought about it.

49
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,820
 Three and a half million people planned a suicide attempt

50
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,780
 and 1.7 million people attempted suicide.

51
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,140
 Suicide was the second leading cause of death for people

52
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,500
 between 20 and 34 here in the United States.

53
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,520
 So just think about that.

54
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,560
 People in your age group,

55
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,460
 the second leading cause of death for young adults

56
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,240
 is suicide.

57
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,500
 Psychiatry professor at UCLA, Carl Flesher says this,

58
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,860
 "While suicide rates are rising among young people,

59
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,860
 "the highest rates are among young adults ages 25 to 34."

60
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,140
 So if that's you, statistics are rising

61
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,480
 in your demographic regarding suicide.

62
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,080
 Now, if we were to just zoom out a minute

63
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,440
 and not just talk about suicide,

64
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,320
 but just talk about things that might lead to suicide,

65
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,600
 whether it's depression or anxiety,

66
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,600
 in 2021 at least, 43.5% of 18 to 29-year-olds

67
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,440
 experienced symptoms of depression.

68
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,360
 And 48.5% of 18 to 29-year-olds

69
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,980
 screened positive for anxiety.

70
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,120
 And you might say, "Well, we are coming out of a pandemic."

71
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,960
 Yeah, and I would just say that many of us

72
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,680
 have never adjusted back to normal life.

73
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,280
 And the past two years have been extremely difficult.

74
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,260
 And so here's the deal.

75
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,440
 The reason that I'm talking about suicide

76
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,120
 is I just, I don't wanna assume that everyone's okay.

77
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,200
 Like the reality is, is depression is real.

78
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
 Anxiety is real.

79
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,960
 No one is immune to having suicidal thoughts.

80
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,480
 No one is immune to having really tough days

81
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,400
 that lead to tough weeks and even tough months,

82
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,400
 tough seasons where life just feels unbearable, unbearable.

83
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,920
 And so the only way out of the pain

84
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,340
 is the thought of taking your life.

85
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,740
 I'll just be honest with you.

86
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,740
 My personality leans towards depression and anxiety.

87
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,380
 And so I would say that I have had thoughts in my past

88
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,260
 that I would even classify as thoughts about suicide.

89
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,820
 So I just tell you that to say

90
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
 that even though I stand on the stage,

91
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,020
 suicide is not beneath me.

92
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,860
 And I would say that suicide is not beneath anyone

93
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,980
 in this room.

94
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,880
 No one is immune to it.

95
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,900
 And so you might not be in a place right now

96
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,860
 where life feels unbearable.

97
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,480
 And yet maybe God has you hearing this message,

98
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,520
 not for this day, but for one day.

99
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,340
 And maybe you never hit that point in your life,

100
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,180
 but the reason that God has you here

101
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,220
 is so that you can go and you can be a good friend

102
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,500
 to someone who is struggling.

103
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,940
 And then others of you,

104
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,500
 God has brought you into this place

105
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,100
 because you have contemplated suicide.

106
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,300
 You have a plan to take your life even tonight.

107
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,380
 And God in his kindness has brought you here

108
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,320
 because he loves you.

109
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,900
 And so we're gonna talk about it.

110
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,140
 When I think about the topic of suicide,

111
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,020
 you know what I'm thankful for?

112
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,020
 I'm thankful for the fact that the Bible doesn't fall silent

113
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,180
 to the idea of despairing in life

114
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,060
 to the point of not wanting to live.

115
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,140
 Like I think about Job.

116
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,940
 Job is a guy in the Old Testament,

117
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,080
 which is in the first half of your Bible.

118
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,940
 And Job was having an amazing life

119
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,460
 and then everything changed.

120
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,740
 Several of his family members died.

121
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,580
 He lost his family business.

122
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,740
 All of his possessions got destroyed.

123
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,820
 Job found himself in a very difficult place.

124
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,900
 He started having significant health issues.

125
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,740
 And so in the book of Job, in the third chapter,

126
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,380
 Job actually, he wrote a song

127
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,620
 because you know what songs do?

128
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,780
 Songs communicate emotion.

129
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,900
 And so I just want you to hear what he said.

130
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,640
 Like in the first chunk of verses in Job chapter three,

131
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,440
 his point is basically, I wish I had never been born.

132
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,640
 So just listen to what he says in verses three and four.

133
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,000
 He says, "Let the day perish on which I was born.

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,160
 "In the night that's set, a man is conceived.

135
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,780
 "Let that day be darkness.

136
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,720
 "May God above not seek it nor light shine upon it."

137
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,680
 Do you hear what he's saying?

138
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,420
 He's saying that the day that someone said,

139
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,400
 "Look, someone's pregnant.

140
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,680
 "She's going to have a boy."

141
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,580
 He's like, "Yeah, I wish that day had never happened.

142
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,580
 "Like I wish that God had turned the lights out on that day.

143
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,920
 "I wish I'd never been born."

144
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,260
 And then he goes on.

145
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,460
 And in the second section of Job chapter three,

146
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,420
 his point is being dead is actually better than living.

147
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,740
 So just listen to his wording.

148
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,240
 This is someone in the Bible.

149
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,240
 This is one of God's people articulating these emotions.

150
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,460
 He says, "Why did I not die at birth,

151
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,780
 "come out from the womb and expire?

152
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,040
 "Why did the knees receive me

153
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,140
 "or why the breasts that I should nurse?

154
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,380
 "For then I would have lain down in being quiet.

155
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,780
 "I would have slept.

156
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,680
 "Then I would have been at rest."

157
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,420
 Do you hear what he's saying?

158
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,280
 He's saying, "I wish I'd been a stillborn child.

159
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,980
 "Like I wish I'd been born and just never taken a breath.

160
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,800
 "It would have been better.

161
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,620
 "It would have been better if my mom had never nursed me,

162
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,900
 "nourished me so that I would grow.

163
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,940
 "It would have been better if I had never been born."

164
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,200
 Being dead is actually better than being alive.

165
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,540
 And then he finishes up his song

166
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,780
 by just making the point, "I wish I were dead."

167
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,380
 He says this in verses 20 through 22,

168
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,940
 "Why is light given to him who is in misery?"

169
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,160
 Did you hear that?

170
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,740
 Why is light, why is light,

171
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,540
 basically why does the sun still rise on me?

172
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,940
 Like why can't I just go to sleep and not wake up?

173
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,260
 Why is light given to him who is in misery

174
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,220
 in life to the bitter in soul who long for death,

175
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,740
 who long for death, but it comes not.

176
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,620
 And dig for it more than for hidden treasure.

177
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,340
 Who rejoice exceedingly and are glad

178
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,880
 when they find the grave.

179
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,980
 This is the Bible.

180
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,260
 This is one of God's people.

181
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,460
 And he's saying, "I wish I were dead.

182
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,840
 "I seek death like a hidden treasure."

183
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,020
 It is good for the man who finds the grave.

184
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,100
 And so I just share that with you to say

185
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,160
 that these feelings, these emotions,

186
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,500
 the Bible allows for these emotions

187
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,500
 to be a part of the human experience.

188
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,700
 And so if you're here tonight

189
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,240
 and you can resonate with anything,

190
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,460
 Job is saying, "Let me just tell you,

191
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,300
 "you are not alone."

192
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,220
 Like there are godly people who have gone before you,

193
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,800
 who have felt what you are feeling right now.

194
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,260
 And I hope you just saw from the statistics

195
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,260
 that you're not alone if you are despairing in life.

196
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,560
 You're so troubled in your soul that you long for death.

197
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,520
 And so that's why we're talking about suicide.

198
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,400
 I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page

199
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,760
 when we're talking about suicide.

200
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,360
 One source defines suicide this way.

201
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,080
 I think it's a good, succinct definition.

202
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,680
 Suicide is a desperate attempt to escape

203
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,640
 suffering that has become unbearable.

204
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,080
 Suicide is a desperate attempt to escape

205
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,240
 suffering that has become unbearable.

206
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,580
 So I just want to illustrate it for you this way.

207
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,200
 I'm going to ask the people on the lighting console

208
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,880
 if you will just hit me with the brights.

209
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,220
 Like I just want you, yeah, that, just like that.

210
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,160
 So I just want you to know how miserable this is right now.

211
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:12,720
 Like this is a blinding experience.

212
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,080
 It is painful.

213
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,000
 It's unbearable.

214
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,280
 And so if you're here tonight

215
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,920
 and you have contemplated suicide,

216
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,240
 this might be how you feel right now.

217
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,080
 Life might feel blinding.

218
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,260
 And the reason that I say that it might feel blinding

219
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,260
 is that you can't see a path forward

220
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,580
 that involves you flourishing.

221
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,360
 Like you can't think of a life

222
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,360
 that you will actually enjoy or experience peace anymore.

223
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,120
 And so I just want you to think

224
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,600
 if this is how you feel right now,

225
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,360
 if life feels painful or unbearable,

226
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,560
 I just want you to think,

227
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,060
 what is putting you in that place?

228
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,100
 Like what has put you there?

229
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,900
 Maybe you've gone through a breakup

230
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,900
 and your heart is just deeply broken.

231
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,740
 Or maybe you've experienced a traumatic,

232
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,780
 something traumatic in your life.

233
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,460
 Maybe someone raped you or abused you

234
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:20,460
 and not one aspect of it was your fault

235
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,180
 and yet you are so violated, so wronged

236
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,320
 that it's caused you to not want to live anymore.

237
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,760
 Maybe you feel like you need to be perfect.

238
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,000
 And maybe it is just exhausting,

239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,400
 always trying to measure up and always falling short.

240
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,260
 Or maybe for you, there's such stress and anxiety

241
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,320
 because you don't feel at home in your own body.

242
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,000
 And so being a Christian

243
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,160
 and just wondering what would happen

244
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,800
 if people know that you are questioning your sexuality,

245
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,160
 it causes such severe stress and anxiety

246
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,160
 that it's caused you to maybe not want to live anymore.

247
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,920
 Or maybe a struggle with alcohol or drugs

248
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,320
 which started out and at first it was enjoyable

249
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,380
 and now it's gotten to the place

250
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,400
 where it is just draining the life out of you.

251
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,240
 I don't know what it is for you,

252
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,960
 but when you find yourself in this place

253
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,320
 where it is painful and unbearable

254
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,720
 and it's hard to see forward,

255
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,480
 what happens is that it's easy to begin to believe lies.

256
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
 And there's three lies

257
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,040
 that when you find yourself in this place

258
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,000
 you can begin to believe.

259
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,580
 The first one is nobody cares.

260
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,200
 Like the crazy thing is that there's over 2,000 people

261
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,900
 that are 20 feet from me and I cannot see you.

262
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,240
 Like I cannot see you.

263
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,920
 I have no clue who is 20 feet from me.

264
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,640
 And so the reality is you can find yourself in a place

265
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,240
 where you just can't see

266
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,960
 that anyone truly is present and cares.

267
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,240
 The next lie that you can begin to believe

268
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,720
 is that suicide will end the pain.

269
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,040
 Like you find yourself in a place

270
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,080
 where life is so unbearable.

271
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,920
 Like you're being blind.

272
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,240
 Like all I want to do right now

273
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,220
 is I want to leave the place where I am.

274
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,760
 Like I want to get to some place

275
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,280
 where there are not spotlights

276
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,160
 that are shining so brightly on me.

277
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,200
 You just want to get out.

278
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,740
 Suicide will end the pain.

279
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,580
 And then the third lie that you can believe

280
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,880
 is that nothing will ever change.

281
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,240
 Like this is how it will just always be.

282
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,640
 I want you to know that tonight there is hope.

283
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,780
 Tonight there is hope.

284
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,600
 Thank you, Lord.

285
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,540
 I want you to know that there is hope.

286
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,020
 But in order for you to see a path forward,

287
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,060
 we are going to have to combat

288
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,720
 the lies that you might be believing.

289
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,380
 Jesus says in John 8, he says that you will know the truth

290
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,280
 and the truth will set you free.

291
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,460
 And so my hope tonight is that some of you

292
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,660
 might experience some freedom

293
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,760
 from some of the lies that you might have believed.

294
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,160
 And so we're just going to walk through

295
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,400
 the three lies that I mentioned.

296
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,120
 The first one that I want to tackle tonight

297
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,000
 is the lie that no one cares.

298
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,680
 Nobody really cares.

299
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,780
 Nobody really cares.

300
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,780
 So all the way back in 2017, which was a long time ago,

301
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,860
 a rapper named Logic, he came out with a song

302
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,800
 that the title of the song was just the phone number

303
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,000
 for the suicide prevention hotline.

304
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,160
 In this song, it basically chronicles this discussion

305
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,560
 between a person contemplating suicide

306
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,780
 and a worker for the suicide prevention hotline.

307
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,560
 And here's what this guy says.

308
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,120
 He says, "I've been praying for somebody to save me.

309
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,800
 "No one's heroic and my life doesn't even matter.

310
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,440
 "I know it, I know it.

311
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,620
 "I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it.

312
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,140
 "I never had a place to call my own.

313
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,900
 "I never had a home.

314
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,260
 "Nobody's calling my phone.

315
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,580
 "Where have you been?

316
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,960
 "Where are you at?

317
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,480
 "What's on your mind?

318
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,020
 "They say every life is precious

319
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,720
 "but nobody cares about mine."

320
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,780
 Nobody cares about mine.

321
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,620
 Do you hear what he's saying?

322
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,440
 He's saying, "Nobody is thinking about me.

323
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,120
 "Nobody is calling me and checking in

324
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,180
 "just to see how I am doing.

325
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,000
 "Nobody really cares."

326
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,060
 Several years ago, the Netflix original 13 Reasons Why,

327
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,740
 which I'm sure many of you saw back in the day,

328
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,360
 is just this account of Hannah Baker

329
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,260
 giving 13 reasons why she decided to commit suicide.

330
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,500
 And on her last recording, what does she say?

331
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,060
 She says, "Some of you didn't care.

332
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,900
 "Some of you cared but none of you cared enough."

333
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,780
 What's the point?

334
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,540
 Nobody really cares.

335
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,100
 And maybe that's where you're at tonight.

336
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,020
 Like, honestly, you find yourself in a moment

337
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,940
 where you're just saying,

338
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,100
 "I just don't know that anybody really cares."

339
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,060
 Maybe you're surrounded by people all the time.

340
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,520
 You go to work and people sit around you

341
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,700
 or you come to the porch every Tuesday night

342
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,900
 and you pass by people and you stand up for the mean greet

343
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,500
 and you say hello to people

344
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,140
 but no one actually steps into your world

345
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,900
 to ask you how you're doing.

346
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,660
 No one calls you and checks up on you or truly knows you.

347
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,060
 And because of that, you feel all alone

348
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,840
 and you've believed the lie that nobody really cares.

349
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,140
 Or maybe it's possible that your workplace

350
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,540
 never went back to normal after the pandemic

351
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,580
 and so your work has just decided,

352
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,260
 "Hey, we're doing everything remote."

353
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,180
 And so you find yourself home way more than you wanna be

354
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,620
 during these young adult years.

355
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,580
 And so you've just believed the lie, no one truly cares,

356
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,340
 to the point where you've considered taking your life

357
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,500
 just to see if someone cares.

358
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,940
 Like part of you has wondered,

359
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,060
 like, "I wonder if I did take my life,

360
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,220
 would my parents really, really care?

361
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,260
 Would my siblings, would friends reach out?

362
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,460
 Would friends truly value the fact that I was here

363
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,840
 and now I'm not?"

364
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,180
 Or maybe you've had the thought,

365
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,420
 like, "I wonder who would come to my funeral if I died?"

366
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,840
 And something in you is just curious,

367
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,180
 like if you took your life,

368
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,340
 assuming that that was even possible in the afterlife,

369
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,380
 to see who attends your funeral,

370
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,000
 something in you, you're just curious.

371
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,020
 It's the lie that nobody really cares.

372
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,720
 I need you to know it is a lie.

373
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,700
 And the reason I can tell you a lie,

374
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,860
 I'm not gonna tell you a lie,

375
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,540
 I'm gonna tell you it is a lie,

376
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,480
 is for a couple of reasons.

377
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,780
 Number one, I care.

378
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,780
 You're like, "You don't know me."

379
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,860
 Well, I don't even need to know your name

380
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,500
 to know I care deeply about your life.

381
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,720
 Why do you think we're doing this talk tonight?

382
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,060
 Like we were planning to end Psalm 23 last week

383
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,660
 and start a series on prayer tonight.

384
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,240
 And instead we pushed those two apart and we said,

385
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,060
 "No, we're gonna do a talk on suicide."

386
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,060
 Why?

387
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,520
 Because I care about your life.

388
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,700
 Like if it requires me to meet you afterward

389
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,580
 and drive you to the emergency room

390
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,120
 and sit with you all night,

391
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,380
 I will gladly do it if it means

392
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,920
 you will make the decision to live.

393
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,980
 Because I care.

394
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,340
 I care about you.

395
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,060
 But you need to know it's not just me who cares,

396
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,360
 God cares.

397
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,660
 And you're like, "Well, yeah, yeah, yeah,

398
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,460
 "you have to say God cares, you're a pastor."

399
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,960
 No, I just want you to connect the dots.

400
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,980
 I want you to connect the dots that you are here tonight.

401
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,940
 You're thinking about taking your life.

402
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,880
 You were thinking about not coming to the porch tonight.

403
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,440
 And you're here.

404
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,220
 And we're talking about the thing

405
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,740
 that is most pressing in your life right now.

406
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:25,620
 That is God speaking in, saying, "I see you.

407
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,220
 "I love you.

408
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,380
 "I brought you here to speak to you.

409
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,600
 "I want you to live."

410
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,780
 I think about this verse that I just came across

411
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,320
 like a week ago.

412
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,460
 It's this verse in the Bible I didn't even know existed,

413
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,580
 which as a pastor, you kind of don't wanna admit sometimes.

414
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,380
 But I ran across it and I was like, "That is amazing."

415
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,100
 And it's kind of like shaken me up over the last week.

416
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,520
 Here's what it says in Isaiah 57, verse 17.

417
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,880
 It says, "For thus says the one who is high and lifted up."

418
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,020
 This is talking about God.

419
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,240
 He's the one who is high and lifted up.

420
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,060
 "For thus says the one who is high and lifted up,

421
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:15,060
 "who inhabits eternity, whose name is holy."

422
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,080
 Here's what that God, the holy God,

423
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,980
 the one who inhabits eternity,

424
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,540
 the one who is high and lifted up,

425
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,020
 here's what he says.

426
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,940
 He says, "I dwell in the high and holy place,

427
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,340
 "and also with him who is of a contrite and lowly spirit,

428
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:35,680
 "to revive the spirit of the lowly

429
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,220
 "and to revive the heart of the contrite."

430
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,420
 Do you hear what that is saying?

431
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,500
 It is saying that the holy God,

432
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,820
 the God who sits in the heaven says,

433
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,820
 "Yeah, I live in the high and holy place

434
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,700
 "and I live with you who is lowly in spirit.

435
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,920
 "I see you."

436
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,280
 And he's just saying, "I wanna move near to you

437
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,940
 "to revive you.

438
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,100
 "I wanna breathe new life into you."

439
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,400
 Now, while I'm talking about God caring about you,

440
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,740
 like this is just a good moment to take an off-ramp

441
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:14,540
 and answer the question, like if you commit suicide,

442
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,800
 does God automatically send you to hell?

443
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,680
 'Cause I think that that's a question that people wonder.

444
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,660
 Well, I do want to be clear that suicide

445
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,660
 is not the unforgivable sin.

446
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,300
 Like, scripture is very clear that there's only one

447
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,420
 unforgivable or unpardonable sin.

448
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,900
 Matthew chapter 12, verse 31 tells us what it is.

449
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,920
 It says, "Therefore I tell you,

450
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,000
 "every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people,

451
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 "but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven."

452
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,980
 We don't have time to unpack what that is talking about,

453
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,080
 but it is not talking about suicide.

454
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,180
 Suicide is not the unforgivable sin,

455
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,100
 but let's be clear, suicide is sin.

456
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,440
 It is sin.

457
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,260
 Why is it sin?

458
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,160
 Because suicide is a form of murder.

459
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,320
 You're like, "No, it isn't."

460
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,700
 Well, think about what murder is.

461
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,220
 Murder is the premeditated, thought out,

462
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,300
 planned out taking of a life.

463
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,100
 That's suicide.

464
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,180
 Suicide is the premeditated, thought out,

465
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,520
 planned out taking of your life.

466
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,940
 And so because of that, we can confidently say

467
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,100
 suicide is never God's will for your life.

468
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,740
 It is never God's will for your life.

469
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,340
 Can someone commit suicide and still go to heaven?

470
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,380
 I believe that it is possible for someone to despair

471
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,740
 so much, for them to be so distraught

472
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,500
 that they make an impulsive decision to take their life,

473
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,500
 and yet God's grace is sufficient to cover over it

474
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,660
 if they have truly put their faith and trust in Jesus Christ.

475
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,340
 And at the same time, some of y'all just heard that

476
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,300
 and you're like, "That's all I need to hear,

477
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,160
 "because you just gave me a pass.

478
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,260
 "I did not give you a pass."

479
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,900
 Because if you hear what I just said

480
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,980
 and you're like, "Okay, good.

481
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,860
 "So now I can go take my life,

482
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,840
 "knowing that you know what, I know it's sin,

483
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,020
 "but God's gonna forgive me and it's all gonna be okay."

484
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,380
 Here's what I would just say.

485
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,060
 Here's what I would caution you.

486
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,020
 If you know that it's a sin,

487
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,020
 and yet you willfully take your life,

488
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,460
 what it does show is it shows

489
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,820
 a lack of complete understanding

490
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,940
 of why Jesus even left heaven

491
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,100
 and came to earth in the first place.

492
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,920
 And so let me just tell you what I mean when I say that.

493
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,380
 Let me just walk you through the reality of Jesus.

494
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,880
 Like a good place to start is to understand

495
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,680
 that Jesus himself was tempted to commit suicide.

496
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,140
 Do you know that?

497
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:57,280
 Satan actually took Jesus up to the pinnacle of the temple

498
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,580
 and he tempted him to jump off the temple.

499
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,460
 Jesus himself was tempted to commit suicide.

500
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,800
 Even on the night that Jesus was betrayed and arrested,

501
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,500
 look at what it says about Jesus.

502
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,080
 In Matthew 26, it says, "Then he said to them,

503
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,080
 "my soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death."

504
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,640
 This isn't saying that Jesus is suicidal.

505
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,640
 What it is saying is Jesus has felt what you feel, felt.

506
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,080
 He has felt what you feel.

507
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,440
 Jesus has been overwhelmed with sorrow

508
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,520
 to the point of death.

509
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,940
 And yet what did Jesus choose?

510
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,060
 He chose purpose.

511
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,480
 He chose to live.

512
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,280
 And then he chose to die.

513
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,660
 He chose to submit himself to the will of the Father.

514
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,720
 And he said, "Not my will, but your will be done."

515
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,560
 And so Jesus Christ went to the cross

516
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,060
 and he died and he rose so that we could live.

517
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,300
 Jesus says in John 10, 10, he says,

518
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,980
 "The thief comes to steal, kill, and destroy."

519
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,000
 Here's what that means.

520
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,300
 It means when a life is stolen,

521
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,260
 that belongs to the enemy.

522
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,980
 That's the thief at work.

523
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,620
 The thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy.

524
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,980
 Jesus says, "I came that you may have life

525
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,100
 "and have it abundantly."

526
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,380
 Do you hear what Jesus is saying?

527
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,940
 He's saying, "The reason I left heaven and came to earth

528
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,940
 "is so that you might live physically and spiritually."

529
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,800
 First Corinthians chapter 16, verses 19 and 20 say this,

530
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,800
 "Or do you not know that your body is a temple

531
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,180
 "of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God?

532
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,840
 "You're not your own.

533
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,220
 "You were bought with a price.

534
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,340
 "Glorify God in your body."

535
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,500
 So here's what that's saying.

536
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,740
 Let me just, the reason I said,

537
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,200
 "You might not have a full understanding

538
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,180
 "of why Jesus even came."

539
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,420
 Jesus came, he was tempted to take his life.

540
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,500
 And instead, he experienced sorrow to the point of death,

541
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,420
 but he submitted himself to the will of the Father.

542
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,260
 Why?

543
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:13,620
 Because he came to die so that we might live.

544
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,240
 And through his death, through his burial,

545
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,420
 and through his resurrection, do you know what he did?

546
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:22,260
 He bought your life and mine at a price.

547
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,340
 So if you wanna know what you're worth,

548
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,260
 you are worth the body and blood of Jesus Christ.

549
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,060
 Not because you've earned that value,

550
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:35,060
 but because God has placed that value on us.

551
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:39,580
 He gave that value to his enemies, to sinners.

552
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,360
 He says, "You know what you're worth to me?

553
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,080
 "I am choosing to value you

554
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,740
 "at the body and blood of my son."

555
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,980
 And so he has purchased you.

556
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,260
 And because of that, you know what he says?

557
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,740
 He says, "Look, you're not your own."

558
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,060
 He's saying, "Your body actually isn't even yours anymore

559
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,020
 "to do with what you want."

560
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,980
 Like for you to take your own life

561
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,380
 and for your soul to separate from your body,

562
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,700
 that is doing something that God has never intended for you.

563
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:11,280
 Like your body is meant now to glorify God.

564
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,140
 And he did all that, why?

565
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,880
 Ephesians 2.10, what does it say?

566
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,820
 It says, "For we are his workmanship,

567
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,980
 "created in Christ Jesus for good works,

568
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,420
 "which God prepared beforehand

569
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,340
 "that we should walk in them."

570
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,940
 Do you see what that's saying?

571
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,820
 It's saying that Jesus Christ went to the cross,

572
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,340
 he purchased you.

573
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,040
 He came that you might live, why?

574
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,100
 Because God has a perfect purpose for you.

575
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,780
 You are actually his workmanship.

576
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,940
 In the Greek, it's the word poema.

577
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,700
 What does that sound like?

578
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,940
 Sounds like the word poem.

579
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,100
 So it means that you are a work of art to God.

580
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,460
 Like God has done something so significant in your life

581
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,780
 that he has created you to do good works.

582
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,500
 Just because you can't see a plan for your life

583
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,740
 doesn't mean that God can't.

584
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,180
 Just because you don't wanna live

585
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,500
 doesn't mean that God doesn't want you to live

586
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,940
 to accomplish good things.

587
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,540
 So I tell you that just to say, I care.

588
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,740
 God cares.

589
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,300
 To believe that no one really cares,

590
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,060
 it is a flat out, it's a flat out lie.

591
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,660
 But you might be sitting there saying,

592
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,020
 you know what, TA, that's nice,

593
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,140
 but I don't care if you care.

594
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,980
 'Cause I don't know you and you don't know me.

595
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,860
 And you have to tell me that God cares.

596
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,980
 But what you really wanna know

597
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,260
 is if your family and friends care.

598
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,260
 Like if that'll move the needle at all.

599
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,220
 And so we need to deal with the second line.

600
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,260
 Here's the second line.

601
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,340
 Suicide will end the pain.

602
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,540
 I don't know who said it, but I'm gonna say this

603
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,180
 and then I need you to listen, let me explain it.

604
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,780
 Someone said suicide doesn't end the pain,

605
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,460
 it just passes it on to someone else.

606
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,940
 And I believe that that's true.

607
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,900
 And yet some of you hear that and you're like,

608
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,380
 you don't get it.

609
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:04,660
 Like to say that, it triggers you.

610
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,460
 If you're thinking about taking your life,

611
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,900
 that feels so insensitive,

612
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,340
 because when you hear suicide doesn't end the pain,

613
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,380
 it just passes it on to someone else,

614
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:18,380
 what you hear is you don't understand where I am.

615
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,900
 Like your pain is so unbearable

616
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,180
 that right now the only way out of that pain

617
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,620
 is to end your life.

618
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:33,620
 And so I just want to just say, I understand.

619
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,420
 Like I am in no way trying to use this quote

620
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,780
 to make you feel shame.

621
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,620
 I'm not trying to shame you into living.

622
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,580
 That's not the goal.

623
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,660
 But I do want you to know,

624
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,180
 I have officiated the funerals of two young adults

625
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,260
 that have taken their lives.

626
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,980
 And I've had to sit with the families

627
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,580
 and I have watched their friends gather.

628
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:01,020
 And I have watched the deep despair and the pain

629
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,340
 on the faces of family members.

630
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,460
 And so it's good for you to hear me say,

631
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,740
 hey, you are right.

632
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,340
 That I do not fully know the extent of your pain.

633
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,300
 You are right.

634
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,340
 And at the same time though,

635
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,700
 it is important for us to realize

636
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,740
 that if you end your life,

637
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,220
 it will end your pain, but it doesn't stop there.

638
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,940
 Because that pain does get passed on to someone else.

639
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,560
 Several years ago, I was talking about suicide

640
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,980
 to a group of college students.

641
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,960
 And a friend of mine whose son committed suicide,

642
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,900
 she saw that I was talking about suicide.

643
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,620
 She reached out and just texted me and said,

644
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,140
 hey, praying for you.

645
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,260
 And I called her and I said,

646
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,660
 hey, would you write a letter to these group of students

647
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,180
 just as a parent, just sharing your heart.

648
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,260
 And so she wrote a letter and today I texted her

649
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,940
 and I just said, hey, do I have your permission

650
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,580
 to share this with the young adults at the porch?

651
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,340
 And she said, absolutely.

652
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,420
 So I just wanna share this letter from a parent.

653
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,340
 Here's what she said.

654
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,140
 She says, I woke up this morning knowing somehow

655
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,040
 I had been with my son in my dreams,

656
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,100
 but not being able to grasp exactly what I dreamed

657
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,880
 or remember exactly what he did or how he sounded.

658
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,660
 The memory is so close, but I can't quite touch it

659
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,860
 and oh, how I want to.

660
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,060
 I miss him so much every moment, every day.

661
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,700
 And knowing I will never see him again,

662
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,180
 this side of heaven is excruciatingly sad for this mom,

663
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,340
 for all of us.

664
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,440
 He left such a gaping hole in our family,

665
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,100
 but fortunately, gratefully, in his faithfulness,

666
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,640
 God has helped us.

667
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,740
 Without God, truly I have no idea

668
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,940
 how we could have even survived this.

669
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,840
 Because that day, the day that two police officers

670
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,320
 came to our door to tell us the devastating news

671
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,440
 will forever be my worst day.

672
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,960
 And to be honest, I so wish I could have done more

673
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,960
 to help my son know how dearly loved he was,

674
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,680
 remind him one more time how gifted he was,

675
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,900
 remind him who he was in Christ,

676
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,760
 name off all of those who loved and respected him

677
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,820
 in his field of expertise.

678
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,360
 I wish he could have truly believed

679
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,760
 how much hope we saw in his future,

680
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,660
 but he had stopped listening and believing these truths.

681
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,020
 Taking his own life was his choice.

682
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,580
 He wanted to be free from his pain.

683
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,180
 But suicide doesn't eliminate the pain,

684
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,700
 it shares it with every person who loved you.

685
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,040
 It transfers it from you to them.

686
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,900
 In my son's case, I saw several hundred people in pain

687
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,540
 at his memorial service.

688
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,020
 I just kept thinking, if only he could see

689
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,860
 this large room filled with people that loved him,

690
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,120
 that came from all over the country to honor his life,

691
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,380
 maybe that would have made a difference.

692
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,920
 And of course, I will always wonder

693
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,840
 what else could I have done?

694
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,360
 Was there something I could have said?

695
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,560
 If only I could have changed the outcome.

696
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,240
 Our seasons of grief have changed in the last few years,

697
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,180
 but some of the effects we've had to deal with

698
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,240
 are devastation, emptiness, regret,

699
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,200
 fear of something happening to another loved one,

700
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,280
 anger at my son for not receiving

701
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,100
 the love and support offered to him,

702
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,040
 shame, awkwardness around others,

703
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,120
 and knowing that every holiday,

704
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,340
 every family celebration will be incomplete.

705
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,260
 My sweet grandsons will not get the joy

706
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,000
 of knowing their crazy, fun-loving, joy-giving uncle.

707
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,480
 We have to live with the mystery

708
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,960
 of all the unanswered questions the rest of our lives.

709
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,560
 Fortunately, God is helping and will continue to help us.

710
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,600
 I can, in truth, tell you that through all of this,

711
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,880
 my God has been faithful to us.

712
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,140
 To one who thinks there is no way out, there is.

713
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,460
 To one who thinks no one cares, they do.

714
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,600
 To one who has no hope, see the hope in Jesus.

715
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,340
 To one who is scared to get help, run to it anyway.

716
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,340
 The darkness of night never lasts forever.

717
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,580
 Wait for the light that always comes.

718
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,860
 I promise that the God who has been faithful to us

719
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,100
 will also be faithful to you.

720
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,300
 My son cannot be brought back.

721
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,140
 That part of my story, unfortunately,

722
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,900
 can never be rewritten, but yours can.

723
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,540
 You can be saved.

724
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,780
 You can live.

725
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,100
 Your family can be spared this trauma, this devastation.

726
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,200
 Please, please live.

727
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,380
 That's a letter from a mom written to a group of students

728
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,540
 that is now passing that on to you.

729
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,860
 I want you to hear me.

730
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,020
 I do not share that with you to shame you into living,

731
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,420
 but it is important for us to realize

732
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,380
 that the end of your pain is the beginning

733
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,820
 of other people's pain.

734
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,500
 And if you were to go and if you were to read,

735
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,740
 it's interesting, if you were to spend some time

736
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,740
 reading people's suicide notes

737
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,940
 that they write to their family members,

738
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:01,200
 it's interesting that one of the most important messages

739
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,300
 that they wanna convey to their family members

740
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,800
 is that they love them.

741
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,140
 And yet, you need to know that that message

742
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,980
 that you wanna share with your family, that you love them,

743
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,200
 that deserves a lifetime to communicate.

744
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,060
 And the worst way to communicate that message

745
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,060
 is by taking your life.

746
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,980
 The greatest way you can display your love

747
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,620
 towards your family and friends

748
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,400
 is by choosing to live another day.

749
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,540
 And so maybe the words of Psalm 118, verse 17

750
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,440
 can be your words tonight that you would just grab onto.

751
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:41,420
 Where the Psalmist says this, "I will not die but live.

752
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,400
 "I will not die but live,

753
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,240
 "and will proclaim what the Lord has done."

754
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,420
 Now, let me just say this.

755
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,700
 Some of you are contemplating taking your life,

756
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,420
 and you just heard me say suicide doesn't end the pain,

757
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,260
 it transfers the pain, and you're like, good.

758
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,060
 Like, that's what you want.

759
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,960
 Somebody has so hurt you, someone has so wronged you

760
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,260
 that the way that you wanna get back at them

761
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,500
 is by taking your life so that they will live in pain.

762
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,780
 I just wanna remind you that to take your life,

763
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,000
 that is not a DM, that is a final post to your story.

764
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,620
 And so that message is not just received by that one person,

765
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,500
 that message goes to the world.

766
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:32,820
 And you cannot specify where the pain lands.

767
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,640
 And so I am begging you to choose to live another day.

768
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,040
 But in order for you to do that,

769
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,420
 we need to deal with the third lie.

770
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,900
 And what's the third lie?

771
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,920
 The third lie is that things won't change.

772
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,160
 Things won't change.

773
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,000
 The lie is that what you're feeling now

774
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,780
 will last for forever.

775
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,460
 And I just need you to know

776
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,260
 that the pain you're experiencing

777
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,700
 will not be the pain that you're always experiencing

778
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,380
 because emotions change, that's what they do.

779
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,780
 Emotions always change.

780
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,460
 And so it's just good for us to know

781
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,020
 suicide is often an impulsive yet permanent

782
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,820
 and irreversible attempt to deal

783
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,620
 with unbearable yet temporary pain.

784
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,260
 Let me just say that one more time.

785
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,980
 Suicide is often an impulsive yet permanent

786
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:26,980
 and irreversible attempt to deal with unbearable

787
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,140
 yet temporary pain.

788
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,700
 Now, I wanna be clear.

789
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,340
 What I am not trying to do,

790
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,200
 I am not trying to minimize the pain that you feel.

791
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,720
 The pain that you feel is real, it is deep.

792
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,180
 But what I am trying to communicate

793
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,840
 is that it will not always be that way.

794
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,580
 It will not always be that way.

795
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,500
 It is possible for things to change.

796
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,020
 Things will change.

797
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,860
 Why?

798
00:38:53,860 --> 00:39:00,220
 Because Jesus Christ is in the business of change.

799
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,260
 He's in the business of change.

800
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:06,420
 Like I think about what it says in Revelation 21.

801
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:11,160
 It says that Jesus Christ is making all things new.

802
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,460
 This is what he does, he changes things.

803
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,680
 God changes things.

804
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,500
 I think about the words of David in Psalm 40,

805
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,820
 which has been meaningful to me

806
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,920
 at different points in my life.

807
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,180
 Listen to the words of David.

808
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,740
 He said, "I waited patiently for the Lord.

809
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,060
 "He turned to me and heard my cry.

810
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,740
 "He lifted me out of the slimy pit,

811
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,660
 "out of the mud and mire.

812
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,440
 "He set my feet on a rock

813
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,760
 "and gave me a firm place to stand.

814
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,520
 "He put a new song in my mouth,

815
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,040
 "a hymn of praise to our God.

816
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,580
 "Many will see and fear the Lord

817
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,180
 "and put their trust in him."

818
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,300
 Do you hear what David's saying?

819
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,400
 He's saying, "Look, I know where you've been.

820
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,260
 "I have felt what you have felt.

821
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,620
 "I have felt like I have been in the pit of destruction.

822
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,980
 "I have felt trapped in the mud of life.

823
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,060
 "And yet God in his kindness stepped into my life."

824
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,100
 And what did he do?

825
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,760
 "After I waited for him, he lifted me up.

826
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,940
 "He lifted me out."

827
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,860
 And what did he do?

828
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,560
 "He put my feet on a rock.

829
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,780
 "He brought stability to my life."

830
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,920
 And my favorite part of what he says is he says,

831
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,420
 "He put a new song in my mouth."

832
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,980
 The reason I love that is that

833
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:21,100
 music is like the soundtrack to our lives.

834
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,680
 Music articulates our emotions.

835
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,900
 And he's saying, "God changed my emotions.

836
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,940
 "He changed the song of my life."

837
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,700
 He can put a new song in your mouth.

838
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,180
 I don't know what the song of your heart

839
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,940
 or the song of your mouth is right now.

840
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,900
 The song of your mouth might be, "Nobody really cares."

841
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,820
 And let me just tell you,

842
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,480
 if that's the song of your mouth right now,

843
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,260
 you just need to know I care.

844
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,360
 But way more than that,

845
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,500
 Jesus cared so much that he left heaven

846
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,940
 and he came to earth, why?

847
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,100
 To die so that you might live.

848
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,840
 The song of your mouth right now

849
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,880
 might be, "Suicide will end the pain."

850
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,920
 But why end the pain by dying

851
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,580
 when Jesus can heal you and you live?

852
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:13,820
 Maybe the song of your mouth is that nothing can change.

853
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,840
 And yet Jesus is making all things new.

854
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,240
 And Revelation 21 says that a day is coming

855
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,460
 that there will be no more tears,

856
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,000
 no more pain, and no more death.

857
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,380
 That is who our God is.

858
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,400
 He is in the business of change.

859
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,780
 What's it gonna take for your emotions to change?

860
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,900
 Well, I promise you, where it's going to have to start

861
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,220
 is with you being willing to be known.

862
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,260
 You know, it's such a high percentage of people

863
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,180
 who contemplate taking their lives,

864
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,140
 never share with anyone that they've thought about it.

865
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,940
 And so where it has to start

866
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,260
 is just for you to open yourself up to say,

867
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,620
 "Hey, I'm not okay.

868
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,980
 "I'm not doing all right."

869
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,780
 So that might mean coming down front after the service

870
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,860
 just to say, "Look, I'm raising my hand to say I'm not okay."

871
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,860
 It might mean calling

872
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,500
 the Suicide Prevention Hotline tonight.

873
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,780
 It might mean going to the emergency room tonight.

874
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,680
 And you hear those things and you're like, "No, thank you."

875
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,020
 But the first step is for you to be known.

876
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:19,100
 It might mean to seek professional help

877
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,500
 because that's where you're at right now.

878
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,900
 But change is, it is possible.

879
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,200
 He can put a new song in your mouth.

880
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:37,580
 I just want to share another email I got

881
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,140
 from someone who attempted to take their life.

882
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,820
 And I just want to share this with you

883
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,300
 so that you can hear how Jesus came

884
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,100
 and put a new song in people's mouths.

885
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,500
 This person wrote, "I was 16

886
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,120
 "when I attempted to take my own life.

887
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,980
 "My parents were finalizing their divorce

888
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,980
 "and had been at each other's throats for months.

889
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,860
 "And much of that anger and bitterness

890
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,300
 "had been projected onto my sisters and I.

891
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,540
 "In addition, my first brush with heartbreak

892
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,340
 "had just occurred and as a teenager,

893
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,580
 "I couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel,

894
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,140
 "as cliche as that sounds.

895
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,240
 "I had left home to spend a month in Mississippi

896
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,420
 "working for my uncle, doing construction work

897
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,940
 "and land surveying.

898
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,380
 "And before I had left, I began a new relationship

899
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,700
 "with someone else and three weeks later,

900
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,580
 "about a week before I was set to come home,

901
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,480
 "I learned she had cheated on me with a close friend.

902
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,600
 "I felt betrayed by her, ignored and unloved by my parents

903
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,960
 "and inconsequential to my uncle.

904
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,240
 "Overwhelmed with emotion and pain,

905
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,120
 "I picked up the pistol my uncle kept in his truck.

906
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,740
 "I put it to my head.

907
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,860
 "I made up my mind that I wanted to die.

908
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,780
 "And that was the only way to escape my circumstances.

909
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,380
 "I squeezed the trigger three times to no result.

910
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,360
 "Infuriated, I opened the revolver

911
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,440
 "to see what caused the malfunction.

912
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,920
 "I found two empty chambers and a misfired round.

913
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,740
 "Through tears and screams, I began to reload the firearm

914
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,160
 "and as I did, my phone started ringing.

915
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,180
 "My best friend from school was calling me

916
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,600
 "to find out when I'd be home

917
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,180
 "so we could go fishing together.

918
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,460
 "And as I answered, he immediately picked up

919
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,100
 "on the fact something was wrong.

920
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,140
 "He asked and I told him about my plans.

921
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,340
 "I apologized repeatedly and he calmed me down

922
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:18,540
 "and talked me back off the ledge, so to speak.

923
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,480
 "He invited me to come to church with him when I got home.

924
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,660
 "And when I met, the message was about

925
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,720
 "how I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.

926
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,400
 "And to drive home the message,

927
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,480
 "the scripture explaining how Christ's strength

928
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,100
 "is made perfect in our weaknesses was presented.

929
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:40,000
 "I was overwhelmed by grace and I'm so grateful

930
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,760
 "that my almighty Father saved my life

931
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,360
 "through my friend that day."

932
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,200
 Fast forward years, I'm engaged, self-sufficient,

933
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,680
 more optimistic than ever,

934
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,240
 all because the good Lord decided to intervene.

935
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,140
 I share that with you because of this.

936
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:03,560
 If you're here tonight considering suicide,

937
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,640
 then consider tonight a phone call from a friend.

938
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,740
 Consider tonight a phone call from a friend,

939
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,460
 not from Timothy Atik, not from the porch,

940
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,420
 not from Watermark Community Church,

941
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,760
 but from the God of the universe to you tonight saying,

942
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,780
 "You do not have to die.

943
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,860
 "I want you to live.

944
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:28,100
 "Jesus Christ came, he lived, he died,

945
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,700
 "so that you too could live."

946
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,400
 And maybe you're here tonight

947
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,220
 and you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ

948
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,800
 and you've heard about taking your life the whole night.

949
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,960
 I just want you to know the good news of Christianity

950
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,860
 is that Jesus Christ wants to give you life tonight

951
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,820
 because the message of the gospel is that

952
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,800
 we all might be physically alive now,

953
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,660
 but we are already spiritually dead, separated from God,

954
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,660
 and yet Jesus Christ has come

955
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,760
 and he has made a way when there is no way

956
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,280
 for those who are spiritually dead to be made alive.

957
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:09,240
 And so I just tell you that because maybe for you,

958
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,380
 you're not even contemplating taking your life,

959
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,720
 but tonight you're gonna receive new life

960
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,940
 and God's gonna put a new song in your mouth

961
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,980
 and it's gonna be a song of salvation.

962
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,140
 And then if you're here tonight

963
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,520
 and you're contemplating taking your life,

964
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,760
 would you come and would you allow us

965
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,460
 to step into your hurt with you

966
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,480
 and to take a step with you?

967
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,360
 And if you're here tonight and you're doing great,

968
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,360
 let me just encourage you,

969
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,860
 would you just lift up your eyes

970
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,220
 and look and see how all of your friends are doing?

971
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:45,200
 If someone is withdrawing, if someone's attitude has changed,

972
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,140
 if someone just consistently feels down, don't ignore it.

973
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,300
 Pick up the phone, send them a text,

974
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,480
 check in just to say, hey, are you doing okay?

975
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,560
 Have you thought about taking your life?

976
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,160
 What is going on?

977
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:05,020
 Jesus Christ loves you.

978
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:07,080
 He is here.

979
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,940
 He wants to meet with you

980
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,600
 and He wants to speak into your life tonight.

981
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,120
 And so I'll just close again

982
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,920
 with the words of Psalm 118,

983
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,320
 that you might take them and grab hold of them tonight.

984
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,380
 I will not die, but live.

985
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,920
 Would you choose life tonight?

986
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,920
 Let's pray together.

987
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,560
 (soft music)

988
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:41,020
 Lord Jesus, I know that this is a heavy talk.

989
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,900
 I know that there's people in the room

990
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,660
 who have lost loved ones to suicide.

991
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,640
 And I know that it brings up all types of emotion.

992
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,660
 The goal of tonight is not to play with people's emotions.

993
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:57,580
 It is, it's simply to speak in and to say, look,

994
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:03,580
 we're here, you're here, and there is hope.

995
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:09,900
 And so I pray for those in the room who feel hopeless.

996
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,960
 I pray that tonight they would feel hope.

997
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,960
 I pray for those who are contemplating taking their life.

998
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,920
 I pray that tonight they would choose to live another day.

999
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,840
 I pray for those who have just had a bad day.

1000
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,200
 I pray that they would look to you

1001
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,240
 for their hope and their peace, Lord God.

1002
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,920
 Just pray that you would do a work in this place.

1003
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,780
 Whatever is needed, Lord God,

1004
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,800
 would you come and have your way for our good

1005
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,640
 and for your glory in Jesus name.

1006
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,440
 Amen.

1007
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:49,440
