[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900]   Wherever you're at on the spiritual spectrum,
[00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.900]   if you're here tonight and you're sitting there saying
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.060]   there is no God, or you're here tonight saying
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.060]   I have known Jesus Christ for a long time,
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.820]   wherever you are at, my hope for you
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.680]   is that you would see Jesus either for the first time
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.660]   or you would see him in a fresh way.
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.500]   Maybe your heart has grown cold to the Lord
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.260]   and what you need is just a fresh glimpse of who he is.
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.420]   I hope that you experience that tonight
[00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.140]   because here at The Porch, we believe God is here
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.700]   and he wants to meet with us.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.920]   And so my hope for you is as we're about to open up
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.500]   the word of God, my hope is that you would believe
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.740]   that God wants to say something to you tonight.
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.740]   We're continuing a series that we started two weeks ago.
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.300]   We got iced out last week.
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.440]   We missed you guys last week.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.580]   But two weeks ago, we started a series
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.860]   that we're calling The Return.
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.900]   Living like Jesus is coming back.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.500]   And so here's the thought of the series
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.820]   just to catch you up.
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.780]   The thought is this, if those doors right back there
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.620]   were to open up and Jesus Christ were to walk in the room
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.100]   and we were to hand him a microphone
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.900]   and he were to say, hey, I just wanna tell
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.820]   all the 20 and 30-somethings in Dallas tonight
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.780]   at The Porch, mark your calendars one year from today,
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.540]   I am coming back.
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.140]   Like if we had that type of information,
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.300]   if we knew that Jesus was coming back in a year,
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.280]   what would change?
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.140]   Like what would we start doing?
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.060]   What would we stop doing?
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.300]   Would things shift?
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.640]   And I think that they would.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.660]   And so each week of this series,
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.560]   we're just talking about something that we might start doing
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.440]   or something we might stop doing.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.140]   Two weeks ago, we started a countdown clock,
[00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.580]   just the thought of hypothetically,
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.540]   one year from today.
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.580]   And so as my friend, the other teaching pastor here
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.140]   at Watermark, John Elmore, comes up
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.060]   in just a couple minutes to speak,
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.420]   you're gonna see that countdown clock come up.
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.820]   And it's just a reminder that what would it look like
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.300]   for us to live with a sense of urgency
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.080]   that our days are numbered?
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.060]   You are gonna get to hear from my good friend, John Elmore.
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.220]   Just one of the greatest pastors and teachers that I know.
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.780]   I'm so glad for you to get to hear from him tonight.
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.860]   So as he comes up, I hope that you just lean in
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.020]   to what he's going to say,
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.940]   because I think God wants to do a good work tonight
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.780]   in our hearts.
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.580]   Before we do that though, just wanna take a moment
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.020]   and get to know the people around us.
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.620]   There are interesting and unique people
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.420]   sitting all around you.
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.060]   And so I just wanna encourage you,
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.580]   take a moment, stand up, turn around, shake a hand,
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.780]   say hello, introduce yourself, and then we'll be back.
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.600]  ,
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.760]   Hey, welcome Porch Dallas, welcome Porch Live.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.800]   (audience cheering)
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.080]   So man, I wish somebody would have punked me
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.000]   and said I was going to happy hour and brought me here.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.320]   Because when I was your age, I lost my 20s,
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.800]   like 20s, like a decade plus, because I wasn't here.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.360]   And so maybe tonight, something will be said
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.880]   that will keep you from losing your 20s,
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.080]   your 30s as well.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.960]   There's some Porch Live locations listening,
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.920]   there's many, but the ones that you're gonna hear
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.600]   from tonight that we're gonna say hello to
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.800]   is Porch Live down in Austin, which is crazy,
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.280]   'cause dude, that's where I almost died.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.880]   More on that later.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.320]   Boise, never been, I'm sure you're good people.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.720]   Midland and Scottsdale, welcome to y'all and everywhere else.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.400]   So when you walked in, what'd you get?
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.640]   Everybody got a penny, yeah,
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.000]   we went big on you guys tonight, right?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.880]   Prosperity Gospel or something.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.240]   Hey, so, no, it's bogus.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.420]   There's a mark of authenticity on the penny,
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.120]   like check it out, like look down,
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.000]   nobody notices a penny, like you walk past a penny,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.600]   you don't even pick it up anymore.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   It's worth next to nothing,
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.720]   but right there beside the year, there's a letter.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.840]   And that letter shows that it's not counterfeit,
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.180]   it's not a fake.
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.520]   Like, in fact, if yours doesn't have a letter, like our bad.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.600]   But it should have like a D or a CC or a P,
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.040]   and it stands for Denver or Carson City or Philadelphia.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.840]   It's the US Mint where your coin was made.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.460]   It's to show that it is real and not fake.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.020]   And as I was thinking about this tonight,
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.860]   I was like, you know what?
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.000]   They probably deserve to know
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.640]   that I'm gonna get real with them and not be fake.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.540]   And so if you flipped me over,
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.800]   you'd see right about here, a tattoo.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.480]   Anybody got a tattoo that they're like,
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.680]   man, I wish I did not have this tattoo?
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.440]   Anybody, show of hands, I see you there.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.240]   Okay, all right.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.060]   So I got my own little tramp stamp here
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.600]   on the right backside.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.560]   And I guarantee you,
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.480]   I'm gonna make you feel better about your bad tattoo.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.120]   I was wasted in Austin, Texas,
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.120]   drunk out of my mind, walk into a tattoo parlor.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.640]   And the girl that I was with,
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.720]   that wasn't her name at the time, but I called her kitten.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.780]   And so I was like, well, what better thing
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.220]   to get tattooed forever on my body than her nickname?
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.220]   So I have the word kitten still right here.
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.720]   And I am married,
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.280]   and I'm married, all right.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.580]   And I'm married, and I'm married to a girl
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.680]   and her nickname is not kitten.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.520]   And it's still there.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.980]   But if you're gonna go, go big.
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.720]   And so I was like, you know what?
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.720]   Put a cat paw beside it.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.000]   So it says kitten in kindergarten writing
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.200]   with a little cat paw beside it.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.720]   Dude, I used to do prison ministry
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.560]   and I would tell them that.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.840]   And the guys were like, dude, you can't say that in here.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.900]   I was like, why?
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.320]   They're like, never repeat that.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.040]   It's a mark of authenticity.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.560]   It's not the only bad mistake I made.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.080]   I made mistake after mistake after mistake
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.160]   after mistake from 18 to 30.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.520]   Because I was an alcoholic.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.720]   I didn't know, I didn't think I was.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.400]   'Cause I didn't keep a fifth of vodka in my desk drawer.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.200]   I wasn't sleeping in the ditch.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.160]   And so I was like, dude, I'm doing fine.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.920]   Working for an ad agency down in Austin,
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.840]   like getting written up and clients like Dell
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.800]   and 3M and DuPont.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.520]   I'm like doing okay.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.600]   Like I'm not an alcoholic.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.880]   I just like have to have fun.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.180]   I work hard, I play hard.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.440]   Like that's it.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.520]   And so on Saturday morning, after a long Friday night,
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.360]   and then a Friday morning, Saturday morning,
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.880]   I'd wake up and I'd put scotch in a coffee mug.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.680]   Now it had to be a black coffee mug
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.840]   because otherwise people would see
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.520]   that I was drinking scotch in the morning
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.800]   to keep the hangover at bay and to keep the buzz going.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.520]   And so I'm like, you know, idiot,
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.200]   like drink all night, coffee mug of scotch.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.140]   And then there was one New Year's.
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.960]   Like you thought kitten was a bad decision.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.000]   One New Year's Eve, like terrible New Year's Eve plans.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.880]   I go in again, I've got a glass of scotch,
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.280]   walk into a car dealership.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.120]   I'm like, what's up?
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.600]   I'm here to buy a car.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.720]   And bought a car.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.320]   And the next morning I wake up
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.560]   and I look out in the driveway.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.880]   I'm like, oh man, I bought a car.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.640]   And it's an Isuzu.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.520]   It was even worse.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.100]   They don't even make those cars anymore.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.440]   They were so bad.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.360]   And here I am left with that thing.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.720]   And then I was in Manhattan once.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.160]   We took like a guy's trip, me and all my college buddies.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.160]   We go out, Broadway, wasted, some party.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.980]   Next morning we're at breakfast.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.580]   I'm drinking 'cause I don't want to feel
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.960]   what I'm feeling from the night before.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.880]   And I want to keep things going.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.040]   Like we're here to party.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.360]   And a buddy leans over, one of my drinking friends.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.920]   And he's like, hey man, have you ever considered
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.000]   that you might have a drinking problem?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.200]   I'm like, you bought a round last night.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.520]   Like you were there.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.680]   Why are you coming at me like that?
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.520]   Have you ever considered
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.080]   that you might have a shut your mouth problem?
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.080]   Like why are you, why?
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.800]   Like we're partying.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.880]   What are you talking about?
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.000]   And then I had two doctors tell me,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.800]   hey, if you keep drinking like this, you're going to die.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.380]   But at this point in my life, I was okay with that.
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.620]   Because the girl and the tattoo, that situation.
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.540]   After I got the tattoo, I showed it to her.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.580]   And she was like, is that real?
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.060]   I'm like, of course it's real.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.140]   She's like, why did you get that?
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.380]   I'm like, 'cause we're going to be together forever.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.540]   Well, she was already sleeping with one of my buddies.
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.620]   That's how I felt.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.340]   Little worse.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.800]   I loaded my 12 gauge shotgun.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.660]   And I called my friend about 100 times in a row.
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.180]   He lied and said he was in Canada,
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.020]   which was good for both of us.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.300]   Because I was like, hey man, you're dead.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.660]   Like I'm killing you.
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.700]   And then I'm going to kill myself
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.020]   because I don't want to spend life in prison.
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.100]   Like that's it, like murder suicide.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.900]   I have nothing left to live for.
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.920]   Like the cars, the money, the house, the lake property.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.180]   Like it's just, it is a house of cards.
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.860]   You pulled this one out.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.780]   It's like, what am I?
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.780]   I'm not, I have nothing else to live for.
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.740]   Like I'm like a dog chasing my tail, going work hard.
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.420]   And it can all be lost just like that.
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.260]   No.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.300]   And so in the midst of not finding my buddy,
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.500]   I took that shotgun, flipped off the safety
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.380]   and put it to my head.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.020]   And I think in that moment, there was a war for my soul.
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.620]   It was the most demonic darkness I have ever felt in my life.
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:57.020]   And just drank a fifth of vodka, passed out,
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.380]   didn't go through with it.
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.740]   And at that point went from functional alcoholism,
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.420]   which is like kind of a joke.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.300]   It's like, oh, congrats, you can hold a job.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.140]   You're still a drunk.
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.620]   To, it's okay to laugh, it's laughable.
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.860]   To dysfunctional alcoholism.
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.860]   Now it was like, I was manic.
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.880]   Like I was coming undone.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.540]   Like high highs, low lows, risky behavior,
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.180]   like nothing to lose anymore.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.060]   Just like walking around draped in an American flag
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.380]   at the US Capitol 'cause I wanted to get shot.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.020]   I'm like, all right, well, I can't go through with suicide.
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.100]   It'll hurt my family too much.
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.660]   So maybe I'll just like, I'm just gonna trespass
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:34.500]   and look like an idiot.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.660]   Nobody's gonna shoot me in the middle of the day.
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:36.580]   No one did.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.100]   So I grabbed these two homeless guys.
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:43.100]   It was Wednesday, December 21st, Wednesday morning.
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.300]   I didn't go into work.
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.340]   I'd stopped going into work.
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.180]   I was in sales.
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.000]   I was like, whatever.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.040]   I just like make a call and then go get drunk.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.780]   At this point, living on a buddy's couch
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.580]   'cause I didn't wanna live with the girl anymore.
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.020]   And I grabbed these two homeless guys at 10 a.m.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.180]   down in, you Austin folks, on Congress Avenue.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.020]   Two homeless guys.
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:03.840]   I was like, come with me.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.980]   We're going to the Stephen F. Austin Intercontinental Hotel.
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.060]   We're sitting on the deck getting wasted all day.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.500]   Run up a $500 bar tab.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.700]   I was like, hey, come sit with me.
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.220]   I'll buy you whatever you want.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.420]   I just don't wanna be alone.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.180]   My brother found out, got a one-way ticket,
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.380]   put me in my own car, drove me to Dallas.
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.740]   I used to hate Dallas.
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:28.700]   Brought me here and my family was waiting.
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.380]   And they're like, hey, you're hurting yourself
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.580]   and you're hurting us, no more.
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.480]   Like, you're either going to rehab,
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.480]   but you're not going back.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.480]   And I'm like, get off my back.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.660]   Like, are you kidding me?
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.160]   Like, I'm already losing everything
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.640]   and now you're gonna ship me away?
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.680]   Just, I'll go to AA.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.640]   Like, okay, all right.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.180]   Like, I'll go to AA.
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.480]   So I go back to Austin and I'm sitting there
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.200]   and I'm like, am I really an alcoholic?
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.000]   I don't, I mean, I'm probably not.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.360]   Like, I'm just going through a hard time.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.760]   Like, I'm probably not.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.000]   Like, isn't that always the case?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.440]   Like, when you're right in sin,
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.600]   right after the moment, you're like,
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.620]   dang, that was terrible.
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:04.860]   I should never do that again.
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.220]   You get a little distance from it
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.020]   and you're like, it wasn't that bad.
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.340]   It's kind of fun.
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.940]   And you get, start getting pulled back to it.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.120]   And like, man, spoiler alert.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.620]   If your drinking friends are telling you
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.320]   you drink too much,
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.600]   doctors are telling you you're dying of alcoholism
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.100]   and your family's doing an intervention,
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.660]   you probably have an alcoholism problem.
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.060]   But I still didn't believe it.
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.000]   So I get online and I Google,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.180]   how do you know you're an alcoholic?
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.880]   It's like, wow, wow.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.100]   [audience laughs]
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.980]   And there was this little test, 12 questions.
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.760]   Took me one minute.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.180]   And for the first time in a long time,
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.260]   I aced the test.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.020]   I was like, oh, shoot.
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.540]   I am.
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.280]   It took me, I mean, it wasn't enough
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.740]   that my friends or doctors or family,
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.740]   it took me admitting, man, I have an issue.
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.320]   So two hours later, I walk into an AA meeting.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.640]   Alcoholics Anonymous.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.320]   Still not thinking I'm an alcoholic,
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.260]   just like, get my family off my back.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.440]   And at this point in my life, I'm a deist.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.560]   I'm like, God exists.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.400]   Like somebody made all of this,
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.120]   but he has nothing to do with me.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.960]   I get the job, I get the girl, I get the money.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.280]   Like he's not doing anything for me.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.760]   And frankly, there were two things that stuck with me
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.280]   from my Bible Belt upbringing, two things.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.940]   And I was like, such bogus, like they're lies.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.400]   I remember hearing there's freedom in Christ.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.260]   I'm like, there's not freedom in Christ.
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.700]   He keeps me from doing everything I want to do.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.980]   It's anything but freedom.
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.900]   And I also heard, I remembered that sin leads to death.
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.580]   I'm like, no, it doesn't.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.620]   Nobody dies 'cause they sleep with their girlfriend.
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.060]   Nobody dies when they look at porn.
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.060]   Nobody dies when they get drunk.
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.140]   That's a scare tactic from a youth pastor.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.900]   Sin doesn't lead to death.
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.480]   There I am living on a couch.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.660]   I've had a gun to my head and doctors tell me I'm dying.
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.380]   I'm like, huh, sin leads to death.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.680]   It just kind of has a long fuse sometimes.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.860]   And so I go to this AA meeting and I'm sitting there
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.000]   thinking about all of this.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.200]   And I'm looking around at these people, I'm judging them.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.620]   I'm like, what losers here at an AA meeting,
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.600]   not knowing it's like, well, hey, present company.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.780]   Like what got you here?
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.460]   And then they ask, does anyone here want to commit
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.280]   to staying sober for the next 24 hours?
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.980]   And I don't know how to explain it other than
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:39.000]   I believe the Holy Spirit moved me out of my seat.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.700]   It's like heart pounding through my chest.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.980]   And like, I don't know if you've ever had that experience
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.920]   where you're like, I have to move.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.940]   I mean, it's just like step up.
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.220]   And so I have to walk forward
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.220]   in front of all these other people.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.700]   Nobody else goes forward, just me.
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.540]   It would have been better if there was somebody else.
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.180]   It was just me.
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.460]   And the guy's like, will you commit to staying sober
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.980]   for the next 24 hours?
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.100]   And in my mind, I'm like,
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.660]   this is the stupidest thing in the world.
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.260]   Sit around and tell a bunch of war stories
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.140]   about how bad drinking used to be.
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.740]   And then 24 hours, are you serious?
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.340]   I'm dying.
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.020]   I need a little more than 24 hours.
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.420]   But I'm like, whatever, I'm here.
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.220]   Yeah, 24 hours, great.
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.420]   Go back to my seat.
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.900]   I'm sitting there judging everybody.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:22.980]   I'm like, I'm so out of here.
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.700]   I'm never coming back to this stupid,
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:25.820]   worthless meeting again.
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:30.060]   I get up and here comes this guy, like biker dude,
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.940]   think Big Lebowski if you've seen it,
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.420]   walks up to me and is like,
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:37.100]   "Hey, so you want to commit to staying sober 24 hours?"
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.540]   I'm like, "Did you hear anything that I just?"
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.380]   "Yeah, that was me."
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.900]   Like, "What are you talking about?"
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:41.900]   He's like, "You want to do it?"
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.060]   I'm like, "Yes."
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.420]   He's like, "Okay, well, take down my number."
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.660]   I'm like, "What?"
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.940]   He's like, "Yeah, take down my number."
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.140]   I was like, "Whatever."
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.180]   "Okay, what?"
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.020]   He's like, "I want you to text me tomorrow.
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.220]   "Let me know if you stayed sober for 24 hours."
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.620]   Like, "What?"
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.460]   He's like, "What time is it?"
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.580]   I'm like, "Dude, you're so drunk,
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.660]   "you don't even know what to, it's six."
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.180]   He's like, "Okay, set an alarm on your phone.
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.260]   "Call me at six.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.100]   "Let me know if you stayed sober for the next 24 hours."
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.300]   I was like, "All right, fine."
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.940]   I go to a Jim's 24-hour cafe in Austin, Texas,
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.500]   stay up all night 'cause I didn't know what to do.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.500]   I'm sitting there and my phone starts blowing up.
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.700]   Hey, let's go downtown, let's go to 4th Street,
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.380]   let's go to the pub, let's go whatever.
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.260]   And I'm like, "No, 'cause this Charlie guy
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.900]   "asked me to stay sober for 24 hours.
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.340]   "No, I'm not."
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:36.900]   Like, "Whatever, call him the next day, six o'clock."
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:42.020]   "Hey, Charlie, hey, did you stay sober?"
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.260]   I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, I stayed sober."
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.860]   He's like, "Okay, great.
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.300]   "You want to go another 24 hours?"
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.940]   I'm like, "Hey, man, I know you mean well.
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.060]   "Like, I appreciate this.
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.620]   "I've got a real problem and I need serious help.
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.180]   "My family's thinking about rehab maybe.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:05.340]   "Like, I don't, thank you for your time, but no."
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.700]   He's like, "Do you want to go another 24 hours?
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.660]   "Will you commit to staying sober for 24 hours?"
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.980]   I'm like, "Okay, all right, fine, Charlie."
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.620]   He's like, "Great, call me tomorrow at six.
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.100]   "Oh, hey, by the way, pray."
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.660]   I'm like, "Okay."
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.780]   And he did two things there.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.180]   He's like, he's already,
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.180]   instead of me just alone trying to quit,
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.740]   'cause I had tried to quit on my own before
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.580]   and it was miserable.
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.900]   It's like, you take a pacifier away from a baby.
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.540]   Like, I'm just like, the only solace and peace
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:35.100]   that I had in alcoholism has now been taken away from me.
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.940]   And so I'm just screaming inside 'cause I had no peace.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.620]   That was my only peace.
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.100]   But he's given me somebody to walk with through this.
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.900]   And then secondly, he was like,
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.060]   "Well, pray and ask God to help you."
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.780]   Now, a deist at this point in time,
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.940]   but I'm like, "Whatever, I'll try."
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.260]   He's like, "Yeah, get on your knees
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.020]   "and ask God to help you."
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.340]   So I get on my knees.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.740]   God, keep me sober today.
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.420]   I don't even know who I'm praying to.
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.020]   Call him the next day.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.020]   "Hey, did you stay sober 24 hours?"
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.140]   "Yes."
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.100]   "By God's strength?"
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.220]   "I don't know."
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.220]   "Did you pray?"
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.060]   "Yeah, I prayed."
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.740]   "Oh, good, then it was by God's strength.
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.460]   "Hey, you want to go another 24 hours?"
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.860]   I'm like, "Hey, Charlie, hey, really?
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:20.260]   "Oh, hey man, I've got friends and thank you.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.740]   "Really appreciate the time.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.740]   "I need help.
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.540]   "I've got to get sober."
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.780]   He's like, "Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.060]   "Do you want to go another 24 hours?"
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.740]   I was like, "Okay, okay, fine, fine.
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:32.980]   "Call me tomorrow at six, I will.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.980]   "Remember, pray, okay, Charlie, great, great."
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.820]   Big Lebowski, "Yes, right."
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.500]   And so I get on my knees.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.060]   And then I hit step three in a 12-step program.
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.140]   I thought it was a secret cult.
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:46.980]   Like, what is this, man?
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:47.820]   I'm never gonna get out.
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.420]   Like, I don't know what they do here.
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.740]   I'm gone, drink blood, secret handshake.
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.540]   They're gonna take my money.
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.700]   It's not, it's like, step one is you're powerless.
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.140]   Step two, God's all powerful.
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.420]   Well, God, whoever you, you know, A is a little whack.
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.100]   Step three, commit your life and will
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.500]   over to your higher power, whomever you deem him to be.
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.740]   Now in AA, when they say whomever you deem him to be,
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.580]   they mean it, man.
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.420]   They're like, they say, "Pray to the God of the doorknob."
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.940]   If you can't conceive of a God, pray to the Coke machine.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.260]   You can pray to the group.
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.020]   It's like, anything goes spirituality.
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.380]   Now I knew from my childhood,
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:25.420]   I remembered another thing, that Jesus saves.
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:30.060]   And so I go home that night, couch that I'm living on.
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:34.540]   And I get on my knees, face to the ground.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.140]   And I'm like, "Okay, I have squandered everything
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.900]   "that you have given me,
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.900]   "but whatever I have left, it's yours."
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:48.380]   You get my life, my mind, my body, my relationships,
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.780]   my car, my money, what I do, where I live, it's all yours.
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:57.060]   And I was born again.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:02.580]   Like I went from depression and despair,
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:08.340]   aimlessness, to joy and hope and purpose.
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.020]   My circumstances were still the same,
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.540]   but it's like he moved me into the eye of the hurricane.
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.900]   Everything's swirling around,
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.220]   and all of a sudden the chaos was still.
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.020]   And I was now, it's like life had snapped into focus.
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.180]   I was like, I literally remember thinking,
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.660]   'cause I've been around enough Christians,
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.940]   I'm like, "Oh my, this is what they meant
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.220]   "by being born again."
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.100]   I was 30 years old, I couldn't believe it.
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.380]   I was like, "This is it.
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.260]   "It's know God and make him known, the rest is details."
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:42.180]   And what I've learned is I bought a Bible
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.380]   and I started tearing it apart.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.380]   I was like, "Oh, what I've been doing in AA
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.860]   "is what the Lord has been saying all along in his word."
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:56.140]   It's like all those times that the sociologist
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.500]   and the psychologist ascend the mountain of knowledge
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.820]   only to find the theologians have been sitting there
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.540]   for thousands of years.
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.180]   It's like, "Yeah, yeah, one day at a time."
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.700]   That's what Jesus said when he said,
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.340]   "Seek first the kingdom and his righteousness,
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.780]   "and all these things will be added to you."
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.340]   He's like, "Just seek first his kingdom
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.020]   "and his righteousness, don't worry about anything else.
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.420]   "He's got you.
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.740]   "Just seek after him and the rest is details.
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.700]   "It's all gonna fall into place, he's got you."
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.940]   And then the next verse, it says,
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.500]   "Don't worry about tomorrow.
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.180]   "Tomorrow's got enough worries of its own."
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:33.940]   When I was an alcoholic, I couldn't conceive
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.180]   of a life without alcohol.
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.420]   I'm like, "What in the world do you do after work?"
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.180]   Like, you play board games?
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.020]   Like, what do you do?
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.620]   I didn't have a category.
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.820]   What do you do on Friday?
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.180]   What do you do on Saturday morning?
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.460]   What do you do at Superbowl?
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.660]   What do you do at Christmas?
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.860]   What do you do on vacation?
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.340]   What do you do at the wedding reception?
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.660]   I don't know what, what do you do on a date?
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.780]   I need that, like I need that.
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.660]   What do you do without alcohol?
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.340]   And God's like, "No, no, no, no, no.
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.620]   "I'm not asking, I'm not."
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.260]   Like, thinking about quitting for the rest of your life
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.620]   is gonna be so overwhelming.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.540]   I want you to think about today.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.340]   You walk with me today.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.380]   Don't worry about tomorrow.
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.940]   Tomorrow's got enough worries of its own.
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.540]   I'm gonna give you daily bread.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.020]   I'm not gonna give you annual bread or lifetime bread
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.220]   'cause I'm afraid I might never see you,
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.300]   but once a year or once in your life,
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.740]   I'm gonna give it to you daily.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.620]   It's gonna be enough.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.100]   And then I'm gonna see you again tomorrow.
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.380]   I'm gonna give you daily bread.
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:25.740]   I'm gonna see you again tomorrow.
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.860]   And I'm gonna give you daily bread.
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:27.820]   I'm gonna see you again tomorrow.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.700]   And this isn't gonna stop
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:33.660]   until you're safely at home with me daily.
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.460]   Just walk with me one day at a time.
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.300]   I got to Galatians 5, 16, like baby believer,
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.180]   and it says there's a command,
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.940]   and it's a very light command with a promise,
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.220]   a profound promise.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:51.300]   Paul says, "Walk by the Spirit."
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.500]   That's it.
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.340]   That's the command.
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.580]   He's like, "Just walk with me.
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.940]   "Walk with me."
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.300]   And the promise, here's the profound promise.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:03.300]   He says, "And you will not gratify the desires of the flesh."
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.600]   And I found that to be true.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.180]   This impossible foe that I was facing,
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.540]   this alcoholism that I could not quit on my own,
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.060]   I'm like, all right, then every day,
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.420]   it wasn't just at step three,
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.380]   every single day face to the ground,
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.760]   like God, keep me sober today.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.480]   I'm gonna walk with you.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.900]   I'm a really bad Lord of my life.
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.900]   Would you be Lord of my life?
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.460]   Don't just save me from hell.
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:33.140]   Keep me safe in this life every day.
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.700]   And he upheld his promise.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.380]   As I walked with him one day at a time,
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.220]   I didn't gratify the desires of the flesh.
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.840]   And I talk a lot about my alcoholism
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.140]   'cause that was the thing that was killing me,
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.320]   but I tell people I never struggled with porn.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.100]   And the reason why I never struggled with porn
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.300]   is 'cause I loved porn.
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.020]   Like, there's no struggle, thank you.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.500]   I loved it.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.540]   Like, it's free, it's everywhere.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.000]   I brought it into a relationship that I was in,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.620]   and that fell off.
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:10.020]   And strip clubs and inappropriate relationships
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.180]   with women fell off, and chasing money fell off,
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.380]   and my language changed, and the music I listened to changed,
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.920]   and all of a sudden, all the desires of the flesh
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.920]   were just like falling away,
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.400]   even though I wasn't even like really focusing on them,
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.460]   I'm just like, today, just today with you,
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.660]   I'm gonna walk with you.
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:32.420]   And what I've found, like, we long for revival, right?
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.220]   Like, if Jesus was coming back this year,
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.460]   it's like, Lord, then let there be revival,
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.900]   that at your coming, you would find faith,
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.380]   and people loving you, and following you,
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.260]   and living for you.
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.300]   Like, we all long for revival
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.820]   and wanna see the spirit break out.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:55.340]   And the greatest, I don't know if I can say greatest,
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.900]   one of the greatest revivals
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.780]   that has ever hit this earth
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.780]   happened through a man named Martin Luther,
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.860]   who wrote these 95 theses,
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.420]   and he nailed them onto a church,
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.700]   and he's like, we've got to change.
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.220]   And you know what the first four were of?
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.720]   95, like, bro wrote a laundry list,
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.060]   like, he spent some time thinking about it,
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.240]   95 things to change.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.180]   The very first four, which screams,
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:22.020]   these are of utmost importance, were all about repentance.
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.540]   He said, when the Lord Jesus Christ said,
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.500]   "Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand,"
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:30.060]   he meant that the whole of Christian life
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.940]   is to be one of repentance.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.660]   And John Owen, famous Puritan theologian,
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:40.660]   he said, "Be killing sin, or it will be killing you."
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.140]   He said, "Do not cease from it.
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.480]   "Make it your daily work."
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.460]   And then you got Jonathan Edwards,
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.180]   who God used to lead the Great Awakening here in America,
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.080]   and he wrote his resolutions.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.320]   He wrote these 70 things, like, this is what I will do,
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.000]   this is what I won't do, and he returned to them frequently
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.660]   because he knew he was prone to, like,
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.980]   drift back away from God and towards his sin.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.800]   And so you see, in all three of these cases,
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.280]   with Luther and Owen and Edwards,
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:22.440]   is that the root of revival is repentance.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.060]   The root of revival is repentance,
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.760]   and it doesn't happen in mass.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.120]   It happens individually.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:37.420]   As the Spirit, like, lights us on fire for God,
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.020]   that we would hate the sins of the flesh
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.900]   and love the glory of God, and individually,
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.880]   and then this growing blaze of repentance.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.960]   Repentance is the root of revival.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.680]   Because I think that so often in Christianity,
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.560]   like, this is the good news,
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:03.920]   that we are sinners separated from God because he's holy.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:08.920]   And so he sends Jesus, God in flesh, to die in our place,
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.680]   live the sinless, perfect life,
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.680]   to satisfy the holiness of God.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.400]   He had to be man to die in our place as a substitute.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.040]   So he did, and then rose from the dead
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.720]   to show that he was no mere moral man or prophet.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.840]   Like, he was God, he conquered death,
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.160]   walked out of that grave.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.440]   No other religion can say that,
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.140]   'cause no other religion is by God.
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:35.300]   But we stop there.
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.760]   We're like, okay, I'll trust in Jesus
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.000]   for the forgiveness of my sins,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.280]   and so I'll go to heaven when I die,
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.740]   and then I'm just gonna eke out
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:44.560]   this spiritual existence in this life.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.200]   And so here you are, saved, but you're not free.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.800]   I've talked to so many people in our ministry,
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.280]   Regeneration, 1,000 people meet in the same room
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.840]   Monday night, every Monday, 6.30.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.780]   They're saved, they've trusted in Jesus,
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.840]   but they are not free according to what Jesus has given them.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.480]   Saved, but not free.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.560]   And you read the scripture, and you're like,
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.220]   that can't be.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.600]   He saved us, and he keeps us safe.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.380]   Like, we're just like too simply satisfied,
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.040]   like, all right, well, I guess, man, my thing's my thing.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.280]   Like, I mean, I was exposed to porn when I was eight,
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.600]   and I've tried to quit.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.040]   I've pled with God to take it away through tears,
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.700]   but man, I go back to it, and here I am,
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.200]   20-something, 30-something, still addicted to porn.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.160]   It's gotten worse, man.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.960]   Started as swimsuit edition or whatever, lingerie,
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.560]   and now it's like full-blown, twisted, messed up.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:41.920]   Or maybe same-sex attraction,
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.280]   and you've never told anybody, never told anybody.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.400]   Jesus wants you to be free.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:52.640]   Maybe you were sexually abused as a kid.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.680]   For men, it's one in five.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.120]   For girls, it's one in three.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.120]   Like, tons of people in this room,
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.480]   and that was not your fault,
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.760]   but Satan wants to keep that secret,
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:09.240]   to torment you, torture you, and keep you isolated.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.920]   Today can be the day to be free.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.200]   Disordered eating, body image,
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.480]   the number of times you may have changed clothes
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.480]   to come here 'cause you felt like you just didn't look right
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.680]   before you set foot in this place,
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.520]   or you overeat or you under-eat,
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:32.360]   like all those things, the drinking, the drugs,
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.920]   the weed, the pills, the junk you can get
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.720]   at the gas station that'll kill you.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.680]   Like, we're just struggling.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.800]   The control and worry and anxiety that is crippling us
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.640]   as a society.
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.560]   Look, Jesus saves you from your sins eternally,
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.960]   and he will save you from your sins today.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.920]   I'm living proof of it.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.760]   It's what he did for me.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.600]   What he did for me, he'll do for you.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.800]   I got home one night to my wife from work,
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.080]   and I walk in, and there's a Post-it note
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:04.920]   of like things to do.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:05.920]   It was like, I don't know what it was.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.920]   Like, hey, the sink's clogged,
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.000]   diaper pail needs to be taken out,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.560]   and kill the mosquitoes.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.280]   I'm like, what?
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.160]   Hey, what do you want me to do?
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.240]   You want me to boil the ocean, cure cancer,
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.080]   or kill the mosquitoes?
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.240]   Which one do you want me to do first?
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.840]   Which one of those impossible things?
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.120]   What are you talking about, kill the mosquitoes?
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.200]   She's like, yeah, I thought you might ask.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.240]   Do you want a number for a place?
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.920]   I was like, oh, yeah, okay,
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.140]   give me the number for the place.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.520]   I call 'em, I'm like, hey, my wife says
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.640]   y'all can kill mosquitoes.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.240]   Like, it looks like my kids are bona fide blood donors
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.040]   in our backyard.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.840]   Is this legit?
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.760]   They're like, yeah, man, we'll come out.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.240]   We'll spray, we're gonna drop some stuff,
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.240]   we're gonna put up some traps,
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.400]   and yeah, we'll kill the mosquitoes.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.560]   I'm like, okay, cool.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.200]   Hey, you probably know this 'cause you're a mosquito guy,
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.520]   but they fly, so they're gonna come over
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.460]   from my neighbor's yard.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.300]   So what do we do then?
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.560]   Like, you're gonna kill 'em in my yard,
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.760]   but they're still gonna come in.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.440]   It's like, yep, thought you might ask that.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.520]   We'll come back out for free.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.080]   You just call us the second you see a mosquito,
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.280]   and we'll come back out.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.800]   We'll kill every mosquito you see.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.840]   It's like, no joke.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.800]   It's exactly what God has promised you.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.960]   It's exactly what God has promised you in Romans 8, 13.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.920]   Do you know how stupid it would look of me?
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.400]   If Laura's like, hey, kill the mosquitoes,
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.300]   I'm like, okay, all right, I got this.
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:26.880]   One, two, okay, three.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.120]   Like, stupidity, and it's what we do with our sin.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.760]   We're like, okay, Jesus, you saved me.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.680]   Now I got this.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.120]   Like, I'm gonna wrestle my way.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.080]   I'm gonna try so hard to not sleep with my boyfriend again,
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.040]   though I know I shouldn't.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.240]   We're both professing believers, or everything but.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.040]   Like, man, we've gotta repent, but oh.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.160]   Or whatever it is that you keep going back to,
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.480]   and you just try and try and try.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.800]   Look, your willpower has no power over sin's power,
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:59.800]   but God's power kills sin's power every time, every time.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.000]   It's Romans 8, 13.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.520]   He says, if you live according to the flesh, you will die.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.520]   I'm proof of it.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.320]   So are some of you.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.520]   But God would never leave you there
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.320]   if you live according to the flesh.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.520]   You do what you wanna do, your flesh, you're gonna die.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.160]   Sin leads to death, it does.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.160]   Sometimes has a long fuse, but it will.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:27.120]   But if you put to death, think about the mosquitoes,
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:32.600]   you put to death the deeds of the flesh by the Spirit,
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.860]   you will live.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.360]   If you put to death the deeds of the flesh by the Spirit,
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.520]   that by the Spirit really matters.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.960]   He's the sin killer.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.920]   It's like the mosquitoes, man.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.240]   Jesus saved you from sin,
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.640]   now the Holy Spirit is going to kill the sin in your life.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.160]   He's the sin killer, 'cause you're like,
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.400]   man, I got some distance from it,
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.920]   but what if it pops back up again?
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.320]   Then you call on God again.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:03.280]   He's gonna come back out and kill the sin every single time.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.360]   It's what he lives to do.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.400]   You can't, he can.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.640]   It's his job.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.720]   Just need to ask.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.880]   You remember the penny that you got when you walked in?
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.720]   I'm gonna go back on my journey here.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:20.200]   The penny is like the smallest increment in money.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.840]   As I said, like you see one in a parking lot,
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.240]   you won't even pick it up, you just walk by like,
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.280]   that's borderline worthless.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.400]   Well, that's how I felt when I was first getting sober.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.720]   I'm like, one day, you kidding me?
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.200]   I need a lifetime of sobriety.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.960]   What good is one day?
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.960]   I need serious help.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.040]   But it says in the scriptures,
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.400]   do not despise the day of small beginnings,
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.960]   for the Lord delights to see the work begin.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.480]   Like, don't despise those small beginnings,
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.440]   'cause God's at work.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.080]   But these pennies, these teeny tiny,
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.200]   next to worthless pennies, I guarantee you,
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:57.120]   if we pulled up Elon Musk's bank account,
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.640]   you know what it would go down to?
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.880]   The very last cent.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:08.080]   All of his wealth is just a massive accumulation of cents,
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.920]   singular cents.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.520]   And so it is, and so it has been in my life.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.760]   Because that first week, when I was first getting sober,
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.720]   it was like, all right, here's one day.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.640]   I commit to being sober by God's strength,
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:24.640]   but I mean, what good is, are you kidding me?
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.560]   One day?
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.640]   It's worthless.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.400]   Two days, 48 hours, I mean, that's no good.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.200]   And then I went a week.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.920]   I was like, I can go a week.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.800]   I mean, a week, I can go a week on my own strength.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.640]   That's nothing.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.760]   And then I went a month.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.760]   And it wasn't hard.
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:47.120]   I was still tempted, but God was doing it.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.320]   And then it kept going every day on my knees.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.560]   God, keep me sober today.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.600]   But then there was this day.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.840]   I was in Hungary, in Budapest, Hungary,
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.280]   sitting at a bar, which you shouldn't
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.480]   if you're a recovering alcoholic, but I was.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.120]   'Cause I didn't have anywhere else to go.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.520]   I was still learning, like, what do I do as a sober person?
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.640]   So I'm sitting in a bar, drinking a coffee,
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:11.200]   still smoking cigarettes, hadn't given that up yet.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:15.200]   And everybody's having pints.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.280]   And I'm like, God, you gotta keep me sober.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:21.160]   This was a hard one that day in Budapest, Hungary,
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.320]   but he kept me sober.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.960]   And then there was this one.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.800]   I was on my honeymoon in Mexico.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.480]   I was at an all-inclusive resort.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.720]   So technically I had bought a ton of alcohol.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.960]   I just couldn't drink it.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.840]   It's really unfortunate, but it was fortunate.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.440]   And Laura's like, hey, I'm gonna go get ready for dinner.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.920]   So just meet me back there.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.560]   And there I am, sitting around tables
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.880]   of drinks that people had left.
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.720]   And back in the day, I had no qualms
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.920]   drinking every single one of them, like, two free booze.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.440]   And I'm just looking at them.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.920]   God, keep me sober.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.200]   Keep me sober by your strength.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.440]   I can't, you can.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.460]   I can't, you can.
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:00.720]   And then there was this one.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:04.200]   I was in Colorado with my wife, her family.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.760]   Everybody left the room,
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.400]   and there was a glass of wine sitting on the table.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.300]   I picked up the glass of wine and went,
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:14.240]   God, keep me sober.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.960]   Please keep me sober.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.080]   I can't, you can't keep me sober.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:22.240]   But over the course of time,
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.420]   he was keeping me sober.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:29.820]   One day at a time, one singular day.
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:35.660]   One year became five years, became 10 years,
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:39.340]   and then 17 years sober.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:50.180]   But truth be told, it wasn't 17 years.
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:55.180]   It was 6,347 singular days walking with my God
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.920]   and him setting me free.
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:00.540]   And so I don't know what your thing is.
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.420]   Everybody's got something.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.720]   Everybody in this room's got something.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:09.740]   It says in 1 John 1,8, if we say we have no sin,
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.360]   we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.340]   And so I want you to think about
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.380]   what your thing is right now.
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.980]   Like, what's your thing that you keep going back to,
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:20.660]   that you wanna be freed from?
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:24.760]   Because I want you to, I wanna tell you how I got free.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.660]   Really simple.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.260]   Here it is, very, very simple.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.500]   I've told you the journey.
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.880]   Now here it is for you, 'cause we all got something.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:37.620]   If you're struggling with sin, you need to act, A-C-T.
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:38.620]   You're gonna see it on the screen.
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.100]   The first one is ask.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.660]   You've got to ask God for help.
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.380]   You can't do this on your own.
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.300]   That's what scripture says.
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.900]   But the spirit can, so you bring him into the fight.
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:49.540]   You ask.
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.140]   Then C is commit.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.620]   Commit to 24 hours.
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.140]   Don't commit for the rest of your life.
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.820]   How many of us have been like,
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.900]   "I'm never gonna do it again, God."
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.260]   And the next week, there we are.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.100]   And he says, "Don't worry about tomorrow.
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.260]   "Just today, seek me in my righteousness."
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.520]   So you commit for 24 hours
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.920]   with a brother or sister in Christ.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.240]   And don't go all mixed gender on this.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.220]   Don't start doing this with a girl that you like.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.260]   Girls with girls, guys with guys.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:22.020]   Find a brother in Christ you trust,
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.600]   sister in Christ you trust, and commit.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.840]   Say, "Hey, I commit to you by God's strength, not mine,
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.500]   "for the next 24 hours, I'm not gonna give in to X, Y, or Z."
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.620]   And say what it is.
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.380]   Don't say lust, say porn.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:37.380]   Don't say sexual impurity, say sleeping with my boyfriend.
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.740]   Don't say my eating struggle.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.020]   You tell them exactly what it is.
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:40.860]   You wanna know why?
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.420]   'Cause in James 5:16, it says,
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:45.380]   "Confess your sins to one another."
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.980]   That's back and forth, that's not one way.
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.540]   And then it says, "And pray for each other."
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:56.340]   Not so that you would be shamed or condemned or accused.
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.880]   It says, "When we confess and pray
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.560]   "so that you may be healed."
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:05.100]   That when we confess and someone else prays, God heals.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.620]   And so I've said before, I'll say it again,
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:08.300]   if you wanna be forgiven, confess to God.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.180]   If you wanna be free, He has ordained
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.380]   that we confess to each other and pray for each other
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:13.300]   and then He heals.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.140]   Why?
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.480]   'Cause He knows that everybody's struggling.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.060]   He's like, "I want this to break out."
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.220]   That everybody would confess
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.020]   whatever it is they're dealing with, pray for each other,
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:22.980]   and I'm gonna heal 'em,
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.620]   and there's gonna be this unending ripple effect
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:30.580]   through Christendom as my people are getting free.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.980]   So let's commit for 24 hours.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.660]   And then you take out your phone, just like I did,
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.780]   you set an alarm for whatever time you're gonna do this.
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.020]   Maybe you struggle most at night,
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:40.380]   maybe it's in the morning, maybe it's in the middle
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.500]   of the day, but you set an alarm
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.620]   and you follow up with that person every day,
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.260]   and they with you.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.780]   You just ask 'em, "Hey, I'm wanting to get free from this.
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.000]   "Is there anything you're struggling with?
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.780]   "Let's do this, 24 hours, let's check in with each other
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.320]   "at five o'clock daily.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.420]   "Let's get on our knees, our position of humility."
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:00.940]   Like pray, ask God to help, commit for 24 hours,
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:02.820]   and then text the next day and follow up.
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.420]   Because what'll happen is when you get tempted,
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.180]   as you will, like I did, like all my buddies,
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.460]   like, "Hey, let's go out."
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.520]   I was tempted, but I was like,
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.820]   "No, I gotta follow up with that Charlie guy."
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:18.700]   And my resolve was strengthened, and yours will be too.
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.460]   As you remember, like, "No, I'm gonna follow up
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.360]   "with my buddy, my sister in Christ."
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.280]   Maybe you reach out to 'em, like,
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.360]   "Hey, I'm really struggling right now, please pray."
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.680]   And God's gonna set you free, just like he did me.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.320]   I couldn't conceive of a life without alcohol,
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.040]   and now I got 17 plus years.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:42.400]   Take a look at your penny.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.680]   This is crazy, crazy.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.600]   What does it say at the top of the penny?
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.820]   "In God we trust."
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.420]   We don't trust in ourselves to get free from sin.
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:55.460]   You can't.
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:56.660]   We trust in God.
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:00.740]   For that singular day, smallest increment,
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.480]   trust in you, not in me.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.260]   Trust in me got me nowhere.
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.100]   You see the word?
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.060]   This is unique to the penny.
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.460]   It's not on other coins.
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:12.140]   The word right there over Lincoln's shoulder, liberty.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.780]   It says in Galatians 5.1,
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:18.460]   "It is for freedom Christ has set you free."
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.120]   And he's writing to a bunch of people who are like,
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.140]   "Yeah, Jesus, we trust you for salvation,
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:25.280]   "and now we're gonna try to follow all these rules."
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:29.020]   And he's like, "You can't, you can't.
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:29.980]   "God can.
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:33.660]   "It's for freedom that Christ has set you free."
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:36.500]   And then the last thing, who's on the coin?
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.560]   Lincoln.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.100]   What was Lincoln most known for?
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:46.940]   Setting free the slaves,
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:50.260]   who never should have been slaves, but they were.
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:53.020]   Set 'em free, the emancipation proclamation.
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:57.460]   Jesus Christ, it says in the scriptures,
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.580]   has set the slaves free.
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:03.360]   It says in the word that we were slaves to sin and Satan
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.580]   prior to placing our faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.420]   He's our Lincoln.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:08.800]   He's the one that came.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.300]   Lincoln laid down his life,
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.420]   shot by John Wilkes Booth in Ford Theater
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:16.180]   because he was freeing the slaves and had done so.
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:19.660]   Jesus laying down his life for his life
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:23.940]   that ours would go free, to free the slaves
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:28.420]   to sin and Satan, why he came, rose again.
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:32.560]   And the emancipation proclamation is Romans chapter six,
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:37.060]   where he says that you have been crucified with Christ,
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:43.040]   laid down and raised again to walk in newness of life.
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.780]   I was reading Romans six once, thinking about all this,
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.820]   thinking about my journey, like what God's done.
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:55.820]   And I was reading the whole chapter.
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:56.980]   It was on a Tuesday night, actually.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.060]   My wife used to work on the porch staff.
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:02.580]   So I'm sitting up there waiting for her
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.820]   and I'm thinking about all this,
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.660]   like man, I used to be such a drunk.
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:07.660]   Jesus, you saved me, you set me free.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:10.900]   And he gave me these words.
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:15.720]   You say that I'm a slave, Satan?
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:19.700]   Yeah, you used to own me, tease, puppet and control me.
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:20.980]   You promised to spoil me rotten,
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.500]   but seems like rotten's all I've gotten.
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.060]   Far worse by your curse, not a limo, but a hearse.
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.340]   You had it running through my veins,
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:30.700]   always numbing all my pains, but it never would sustain.
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.580]   But I tried and imbibed and relied on a feeling,
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:36.500]   like a junkie needing more, getting high and then reeling.
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:39.140]   Your lies were crafty and always sounded brand new,
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:42.020]   even though time and time again, I swore I was through.
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:44.340]   It was like daily amnesia.
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.600]   And sweet poison was your feature,
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.360]   like a caged, abused beast, always promising to feast.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.440]   You kept me hungry and longing for more,
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.060]   but you never loved me.
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.600]   I was only your whore.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.200]   And so you fed me and misled me,
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.480]   just enough to keep me loyal,
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.240]   making me think that somehow, someday,
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.840]   through all my inner toil,
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.440]   I could be freed from this disaster,
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.440]   you cruel, addicting master.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.900]   Like a mistreated woman who knew no other life,
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:10.280]   I went back to the jerk despite all of the strife.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.680]   But while you were sleeping, Satan,
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.280]   another came knocking and grabbed me by my life
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.080]   with all his crazy talking.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.480]   He said that as a slave, there's only one way out,
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.920]   and that his way, the only way,
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.680]   was not a safe or easy route.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:29.160]   His solution was to die, my heart pounding through my chest.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.480]   I thought he came to rescue,
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.280]   but his answer was straight, death.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:37.920]   Then this man, like a father, smiled as he said,
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.040]   "You'll no longer be a slave
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.560]   "when your master finds you dead."
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.400]   Then he took me in his arms
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.920]   and laid me down into the deep, spiritually suffocating.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.840]   I tried to wrestle, but he would keep holding me under
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.000]   until I gave in.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.280]   It was necessary for this slave to sin,
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:01.280]   to give up my last breath until he verified my death.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:05.720]   It was finished, 'cause I was born again.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.840]   His holy breath filled my chest,
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.000]   alive and knew the curse had left.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.800]   My old master had no power.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.280]   It was no longer his hour.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.720]   He still tried calling, but now I didn't listen
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.960]   because I was new and I had a new mission.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.520]   It was all about my king.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.480]   I was rescued and redeemed,
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:25.240]   and it couldn't happen on my own or by following some rules.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.080]   It demanded a savior, not the counsel of fools.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.920]   It required his death and mine as well,
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.200]   but it didn't stop there.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:36.440]   Now I live to tell that he rose again, and thus so did I.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.880]   He made me new.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.480]   Never again will I die.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.960]   My old master won't quit and still tempts me with thrill,
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.920]   but now I hate him 'cause I know his intent is to kill.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.080]   So I won't go back to the patterns of old.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.760]   I am a new slave, redeemed, I'm sold.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.200]   I have a new master, one Christ, one Lord.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.320]   Now to him I cry out when hungry, tired, or bored.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.320]   You say that I'm a slave, Satan?
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:04.040]   Indeed, his solely, and this slave is now free,
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.420]   and the result will be holy.
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.720]   My new master is good, loving, and just.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.880]   His life leads to peace if only you'll trust.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.480]   In his life and death and rising again,
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:20.120]   he took your place and nailed all your sin to the cross
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.760]   and disarmed the enemy.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.640]   He is the way, truth, and life eternally
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.520]   from one slave to another.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.040]   Won't you come and see?
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:33.040]   My Jesus breaks chains and sets the slaves free.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:38.460]   (congregation cheering)
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:41.960]   (congregation applauding)
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:45.800]   In Romans chapter six, verse six,
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:53.060]   we know, we know that our old self
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:56.000]   was crucified with him.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.940]   Our old self, the one that was a slave to sin and Satan,
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:04.940]   was crucified with him in order that the body of sin
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.320]   might be brought to nothing.
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:12.980]   So that we would no longer be enslaved to sin,
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:17.420]   for one who has died has been set free.
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:21.100]   Has been set free.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:26.100]   Has been set free from sin through Jesus Christ,
[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:28.300]   your risen Lord, let's pray.
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:32.100]   Lord Jesus,
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:37.360]   you have saved me.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:43.360]   And you have delivered me from my sin that devoured me.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:48.000]   And I believe that what you did for me,
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.960]   you will do for everyone in this room
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.360]   should they call upon you.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:58.520]   The question is not if this is true.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:02.260]   Lord, I long for them to know that it is true for you,
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:03.560]   it's true for them.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.000]   And that they would begin this walk of daily repentance
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.560]   to not only trust you for their salvation,
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:13.040]   but to trust you every day for their freedom.
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:17.500]   Because it's for freedom that you have set us free.
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:21.240]   And so I pray before they walk out these doors tonight,
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.800]   they would text another person, nudge their neighbor,
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.480]   and say, let's do it.
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:29.260]   Let's do it, let's let repentance be the root of revival.
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.160]   Let it begin with me.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.800]   Because Jesus is coming back.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:35.400]   One year, two years, 10.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.760]   Jesus is coming back.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.720]   And may he find his bride without wrinkle, stain,
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.040]   or blemish at his coming.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.860]   God, we can't, but you can.
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:51.080]   And so we stand and we sing to you,
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:56.080]   our risen Savior, our deliverer from sin, in Jesus' name.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.940]   Amen, y'all please stand, sing to Jesus now.
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:02.100]   (audience applauding)
