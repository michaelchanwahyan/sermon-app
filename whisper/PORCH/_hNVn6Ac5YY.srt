1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:24,480
 All right, let's go.

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,000
 Welcome, friends of the room, friends in Phoenix,

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,480
 in the Woodlands, El Paso, Nashville, Mint Hill,

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,560
 Austin, Texas, Houston, Texas, wherever you are joining

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,020
 and listening in all the live locations

7
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,400
 and everybody that is here.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,200
 Hey, we are continuing the series Roaring 20s.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,600
 Tonight, we are gonna talk about relationships,

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,780
 dating, how to make sure that you don't set yourself up

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,800
 on one of the biggest arenas of life

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,240
 to experience pain in the next 10 years of your life.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,440
 Let me start by asking this question.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,240
 What is the greatest romantic comedy of all time?

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,760
 The Notebook.

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,480
 Is that a comedy?

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,740
 That's such a tragedy.

18
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,880
 You gotta laugh more.

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,040
 What else, what is it?

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,960
 All right, I heard it.

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,800
 I'm gonna go on record.

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,080
 I think the greatest romantic comedy of all time

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,720
 is How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,400
 (audience cheering)

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,040
 You guys remember this?

26
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,560
 With Kate and Matthew McConaughey, 2003,

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,080
 the dress that set off a thousand prom dresses

28
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,920
 across the room and across the world.

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,720
 If you don't know the story, let me catch you up.

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,000
 This is all going somewhere, by the way,

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,560
 just not me getting off my chest, my favorite rom-com.

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,520
 But the story is this.

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,120
 So Kate was a columnist.

34
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,500
 She was working for this magazine.

35
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,480
 Think like Cosmo only, they didn't name it that

36
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,840
 'cause of copyright.

37
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,080
 But she's working for this magazine.

38
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,680
 She's got an assignment in the column.

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,360
 Hey, I want you to write a article or a column

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,480
 on how to lose a guy in 10 days.

41
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,200
 He's gotta make him fall in love with you

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,300
 and then how to get out of that relationship in 10 days.

43
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,340
 And then at the same time,

44
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,500
 Matthew is doing some diamond deal

45
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,000
 where he basically finds himself,

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,800
 in order to get a job, he had to convince his boss,

47
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,040
 hey, I can sell anything, including myself.

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
 And his boss says, all right.

49
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,400
 And they're at the same party, coincidentally.

50
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,720
 His boss looks over, sees Blondie, says,

51
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,800
 hey, I want you to go and make Blondie,

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,340
 that's not what she says, make her fall in love with you.

53
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,160
 And he's like, challenge accepted.

54
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,680
 So now they've got this irrespective,

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,460
 she's gonna try to get him to lose

56
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,400
 or to drop him like a tot.

57
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,540
 He's gonna find a way to make her fall in love.

58
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,660
 And Kate Hudson then goes into this relationship

59
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,580
 and does all the iconic things

60
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,180
 that you would think a girl would do

61
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,780
 to try to make a guy be like, man, this is just too much.

62
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,800
 You are way too extra, I'm outta here.

63
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,900
 So that included things like getting a dog

64
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,740
 very quickly into the relationship.

65
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,420
 It's like, oh, they got a dog named Princess,

66
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,140
 which is one of the more ugly dogs you've ever seen.

67
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,660
 Burberry and all.

68
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,640
 It included her getting a,

69
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,700
 coming over during the poker night with the game.

70
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,420
 If you remember this moment,

71
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,420
 where she's there, there she is wiping his nose,

72
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,620
 all the guys are over.

73
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,100
 Included the famous love fern.

74
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,100
 Remember this?

75
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,580
 That he let die and then claimed no, it was sleeping.

76
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,860
 I mean, there's some genius moments in the entire thing.

77
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,100
 And then finally, they end up meeting at that party.

78
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,260
 And if you know the story, I won't go into all of it,

79
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,140
 but eventually they decide that they do wanna be together

80
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,240
 and she doesn't write the column

81
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,080
 that she would have thought of.

82
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,460
 And there they are with the iconic moment on the bridge.

83
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,460
 She doesn't go to Chicago for the job

84
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,580
 and just the greatest rom-com of all time.

85
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,500
 It's one of those movies that there's some part of us

86
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,580
 that loves it because it's like, oh man,

87
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,900
 just this idea that these starstruck lovers,

88
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,360
 that even though they weren't trying to make it work,

89
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,460
 there was something inside of them

90
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,980
 that just couldn't keep them apart

91
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,740
 in this amazing love story.

92
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,240
 It really resonates because all of us

93
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,880
 want to have this love story

94
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,820
 that no matter the imperfections and the challenges

95
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,800
 and the journeys that we go along,

96
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,620
 we hope that one day we're gonna just kind of bump

97
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,620
 into that person and there they are and here I am

98
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,140
 and it's gonna work together

99
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,420
 and we're gonna make it last forever.

100
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:01,420
 And yet we live in a culture that does anything but that

101
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,400
 or a culture where love that lasts,

102
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,120
 I mean, marriages that not just stay together,

103
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,560
 but where two people come and they really love each other,

104
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,460
 they really enjoy being with one another,

105
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,540
 they share the same values

106
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,980
 where they don't end up in divorce, is increasingly rare.

107
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,620
 I mean, let alone the stat of like 40 to 50%

108
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,180
 of marriages end up in divorce

109
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,980
 and yet how many marriages, even the ones that don't,

110
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,620
 end up just in a loveless, sexless, unromantic life.

111
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,300
 And the God who's there doesn't want that to be your story.

112
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,220
 He doesn't want that to be my story.

113
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,060
 And you may not know this,

114
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,500
 like if you came in the room and you're like,

115
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,860
 man, I would love to be in love someday and in a marriage

116
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,620
 and I would love that to be a part of my story,

117
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,860
 good news is statistically like 75% of you

118
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,380
 will experience that by the age of 35.

119
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,500
 And even further good news is that the God who is there,

120
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,080
 he wants you to experience a romance and a marriage

121
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,700
 that exceeds any romantic comedy that is out there,

122
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,060
 beyond anything that you could even hope for yourself,

123
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,940
 he is committed and desires you to experience that.

124
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,420
 But in culture, though they put up this lofty idea

125
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,900
 of like, man, this would be amazing,

126
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,100
 we celebrate that romantic comedy,

127
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,100
 we also have sold a bunch of lies

128
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,020
 that many of us have believed, many of us are living out

129
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,780
 and they are keeping you from experiencing

130
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,380
 the type of love that you want.

131
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,380
 So what I wanna talk about tonight,

132
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,220
 we're gonna fly through, I'm gonna cover 10 things,

133
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,700
 if you take notes, there are gonna be 10 things

134
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,860
 about how to lose at love in 10 ways.

135
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,140
 How to lose at love in 10 ways.

136
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,380
 Over the next 10 years, listen to me very closely,

137
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,700
 you most likely will decide the person

138
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,180
 you're gonna spend the rest of your life with,

139
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,020
 think about that.

140
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,440
 Among the decisions that are most gonna impact your life,

141
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,960
 few, if any, other than who you're gonna trust

142
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,800
 as Lord and Savior, are gonna be more important

143
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,540
 than who you marry and covenant your life to.

144
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,160
 And there are some real clear things that culture is saying,

145
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,360
 hey, this is how you should date,

146
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,280
 and if you date that way, you can be sure

147
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,520
 you will lose at love in the next 10 years.

148
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,800
 And you'll lose at love in these 10 ways.

149
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,720
 So we're gonna fly through, I'm gonna cover each of them

150
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,960
 for the next like 30 minutes,

151
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,400
 so we're gonna go through very quickly how to lose at love,

152
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,940
 this is kind of a high level, what not to do,

153
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,360
 we've done lots of dating series,

154
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,920
 you can go check out any of those on the porch app

155
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,440
 if you're interested in finding out more

156
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,640
 of the kind of proactive things to do,

157
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,080
 this is like, hey, you need to avoid these landmines,

158
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,040
 'cause if not, you're gonna lose at love in the next 10 years

159
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,200
 if your love life looks like one of these 10 ways.

160
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,220
 All right, so the first one, in fact,

161
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,360
 let me just read all of them up top.

162
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,840
 All right, so I'll just fly through 'em,

163
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,760
 hey, here's 10 ways to lose at love in the next 10 years.

164
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,640
 Date for fun, make exceptions if they're exceptional,

165
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,620
 play married, search for the best,

166
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,660
 jump from relationship to relationship,

167
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,660
 focus on chemistry over character, project past hurts,

168
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,660
 isolate your relationship, have sex when you're ready,

169
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,820
 believe love is something that you fall into.

170
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,100
 Your closing prayer right there, just ended.

171
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,300
 (congregation laughing)

172
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,100
 All right, let me go through them a little bit slower.

173
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,760
 Date for fun, what I would say, date for fun,

174
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,320
 why is dating for fun a bad idea?

175
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,800
 This is the idea, what does this look like?

176
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
 This looks like dating is just kind of for sport.

177
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,060
 I'm not really ready to get married yet,

178
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,140
 but I also don't love not having anything to do

179
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,180
 on a Friday night.

180
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,620
 I'd love to have somebody paying for my meals

181
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,300
 every now and then, that kind of sounds fun.

182
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,700
 And let's be honest, attention from the opposite sex,

183
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,580
 that's pretty cool.

184
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,080
 And so you're just in that season

185
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,460
 where you're dating for fun,

186
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,260
 you're not really interested in settling down,

187
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,500
 you're kind of playing the field,

188
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,540
 you've got 16 dating apps, you're swiping on Tinder.

189
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,920
 Why and how could that be a bad idea?

190
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,020
 The Bible says in Proverbs chapter four, verse 23,

191
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,300
 Solomon, wisest man who ever lived,

192
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,800
 above everything else, it says,

193
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,980
 guard your heart, protect your heart,

194
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,260
 for it is the wellspring of life.

195
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,300
 That wellspring of life just means everything you do in life

196
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,380
 flows from your heart.

197
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,380
 And Solomon's like, hey, I wrote a lot of Proverbs,

198
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,960
 wrote Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, that was pretty cool.

199
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,740
 But above everything else I've ever written,

200
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,620
 I want you to listen, Solomon would say,

201
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,180
 protect your heart.

202
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,300
 Why is it a bad idea to casually date?

203
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,300
 Because in doing so, you are training yourself

204
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,940
 to give your heart away, to give small parts

205
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,780
 of your heart away, to give large parts of your heart away,

206
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,540
 and you are training yourself to break up

207
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,820
 and do and experience something

208
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,700
 God never intended your heart to experience.

209
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,840
 That breakup.

210
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,300
 And everything you do in life flows from your heart.

211
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,540
 And so every time you casually date

212
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,900
 and you give a little bit of a way,

213
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,440
 you are giving away a part of your heart,

214
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,140
 and it's gonna impact the next relationship

215
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,420
 and your future marriage.

216
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,900
 And Solomon's gonna say, it's gonna impact

217
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,260
 all of your life, do not be a fool.

218
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,420
 And it is foolish to casually date.

219
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,520
 You are training yourself, not for marriage,

220
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,800
 but for divorce.

221
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,220
 I mean, just like practically, think about it.

222
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,900
 I get in a relationship, we're kind of together,

223
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,420
 we have all these mixed emotions,

224
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,660
 we fool around, we hook up, and then we break up.

225
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,660
 You're experiencing something

226
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,880
 God never intended you to experience.

227
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,260
 You know, dating is a relatively new invention.

228
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,540
 It's like less than 100 years old,

229
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,320
 or around 100 years old.

230
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,140
 Like, people have been driving a car and flying planes

231
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,280
 about the same length of time that they've been dating.

232
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,280
 And we really haven't mastered this craft.

233
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,460
 So if the world around us says, man, just date around,

234
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,820
 kind of figure out what you like,

235
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,300
 you are taking your cue and advice,

236
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,460
 and it's gonna end up with you experiencing

237
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,480
 losing at love in the next 10 years, 10 ways.

238
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,660
 So the first one, dating around, dating just for sport.

239
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,060
 The truth is, in this time, you should be selective.

240
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,960
 If you're not ready to get married, you should not date.

241
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,800
 If you're not ready to get married,

242
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,140
 like in the next 12 months, you should not date.

243
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:52,040
 Second one, make exceptions if they are exceptional.

244
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,520
 Make exceptions if they are exceptional.

245
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,120
 Now we are just getting up in people's business.

246
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,600
 This looks like, you're at work, you got that coworker,

247
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,280
 he's a cute guy, you're hanging out,

248
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,480
 and he's like, oh, you know,

249
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,400
 what are you doing this afternoon?

250
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,760
 You go on a date, you begin to talk about faith,

251
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,120
 and it's important to you,

252
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,580
 and you're trying to grow in your spiritual walk.

253
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,120
 You ask him, does he have a faith,

254
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,480
 or where's he at in that?

255
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,480
 And he describes something of like, no, not really,

256
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,200
 but I'm not opposed to coming to church,

257
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,400
 and you begin to go, oh, man, you know,

258
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,680
 but he's such a great guy.

259
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,360
 He's so nice, and he's so kind,

260
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,000
 and he's open to coming to church.

261
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,240
 I mean, he's not a Christian, or he's not following Jesus,

262
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,120
 but he's open to coming with me.

263
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,720
 I could be a good source of light in his life.

264
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,000
 Or it looks like you being the person who's like,

265
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,840
 I'm gonna make exceptions

266
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,400
 'cause I think this is exceptional circumstance,

267
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,800
 and I've been dating this guy,

268
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,640
 and he cheated on his girlfriend with me,

269
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,480
 and we started dating,

270
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,080
 but he wouldn't cheat on me like that

271
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,000
 because we are totally different.

272
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Or you're the guy, maybe you're dating a girl,

273
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,480
 and people are like, dude,

274
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,560
 have you looked at her Instagram?

275
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,840
 Like, every other picture is her putting her cleavage out

276
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,520
 in the shortest dress that you could ever see,

277
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,440
 and this doesn't seem like she's a girl

278
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,320
 who wants to be known for godly qualities,

279
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,920
 and you're like, yeah, you know,

280
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,800
 but she dresses that way,

281
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,440
 but it's 'cause she's a cheerleader, dude.

282
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,040
 You have to in order to get the job.

283
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,680
 Let me just say this.

284
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,720
 If any relationship that you're in

285
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,080
 includes you saying something like, yes,

286
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,960
 but you should get your butt out of that relationship.

287
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,640
 (congregation laughing)

288
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,760
 I couldn't be more serious.

289
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
 There's not a more significant human relationship

290
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,720
 that you're gonna have than your marriage,

291
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,320
 or your wife, or your husband,

292
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,680
 and you thinking, man, I'm gonna make an exception here

293
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,160
 'cause they seem to be pretty exceptional.

294
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,000
 Here's what I know.

295
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,600
 You are not gonna be the exception to the rule.

296
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,840
 You will be a statistic,

297
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,400
 and you're gonna lose at love in 10 ways.

298
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,280
 The Bible says that the qualities

299
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,640
 that you should look for in a person

300
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,880
 are character, someone who fears the Lord.

301
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,720
 Proverbs chapter 31, verse 30 says, charm is deceptive.

302
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,960
 Like, hey, man, they just seem like they got charisma.

303
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,360
 Like, being around them, there's a connection.

304
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,360
 Beauty is fleeting, but a woman or a man who fears the Lord,

305
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,240
 that means they know God.

306
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,840
 They walk with him.

307
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,960
 They live in light of knowing and walking with God.

308
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,320
 They are worthy to be praised.

309
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,680
 Honor them for all that their hands have done,

310
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,880
 and let their works bring praise at the city gate

311
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,520
 or like in the community.

312
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,560
 Proverbs 14, verse one says, the wise woman builds her house.

313
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,600
 Or you could have the wise man, like someone who's wise.

314
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,660
 This is who you should look for.

315
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,600
 The wise man, wise woman builds their house, builds it up.

316
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,560
 But with her own hands, the foolish one tears it down.

317
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,680
 Solomon says, two types of people in the world.

318
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,080
 You got people who are wise, know God, walk with him.

319
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,320
 They're gonna be someone that if you let into your life,

320
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,620
 you marry that person, you're gonna have a house one day,

321
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,040
 a family one day, that's all built up.

322
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,200
 Then there's the homewrecker.

323
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
 They're a fool.

324
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 They don't know God.

325
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,420
 They don't walk with him.

326
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,320
 He literally says, wrecks their home.

327
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,740
 Says, you need to decide what are you gonna look for?

328
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,000
 And if you're making exceptions

329
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,600
 'cause you think they're exceptional,

330
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,480
 you're gonna end up with a homewrecker.

331
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,760
 And you're not gonna win at love,

332
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,000
 you're gonna lose at love in the second one.

333
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,360
 Third idea, play married.

334
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,840
 What do I mean by play married?

335
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,680
 This means we live together, we sleep together,

336
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,960
 we've moved in, we think the next step in our relationship

337
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,540
 is moving in and kind of exploring like,

338
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,180
 is this something that could long-term work out?

339
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,140
 Let me just first say,

340
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,280
 I get why this is such an appealing thing.

341
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,980
 Like rent is expensive,

342
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,660
 you're spending a lot of time together.

343
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,220
 Some of you are listening right now and you're like,

344
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,380
 yeah, but I'm spending the night over there a lot anyways.

345
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,620
 I got a lot of my stuff over there.

346
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,860
 We might as well move in, save on rent.

347
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,380
 My roommates all moved out.

348
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,500
 I mean, where am I supposed to go?

349
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,140
 Where do you want me to live?

350
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,960
 It just makes sense.

351
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,900
 And we're ready to take the next step in our relationship.

352
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,780
 We need to see, I even have parents telling me,

353
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,040
 some of you may say, hey, hey, before you get engaged,

354
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,720
 you guys should probably like live together a little bit

355
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,180
 and see if this is something that you're really sure

356
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,880
 you wanna move forward in.

357
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,960
 Why would that be a bad idea?

358
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,280
 The Bible says in Hebrews chapter 11,

359
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,600
 sorry, Hebrews chapter 13, verse four,

360
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,280
 marriage should be honored by all.

361
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,000
 And the marriage bed or having sex

362
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,700
 should be kept pure just for marriage.

363
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,180
 God will judge the adulterer in the sexually immoral.

364
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,100
 If you're living together, having sex together,

365
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,900
 giving your heart away, you're not honoring marriage.

366
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,180
 You're not preparing yourself for marriage.

367
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,320
 And you are setting yourself up to lose

368
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,160
 in the third way at love.

369
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,620
 Why do I say you're not preparing yourself for marriage?

370
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,100
 Like here's what living together is,

371
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,060
 in case you think this is like,

372
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,700
 this will prepare us for marriage.

373
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,620
 When you live together and you're in a dating relationship,

374
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,980
 you're basically going like,

375
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,620
 it's more of a combination of your college roommate

376
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,720
 and a sex partner than it is a marriage.

377
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,560
 It's true.

378
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,560
 It's like, oh, dude, we sleep together,

379
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,600
 we kinda pay half the bills, I'll pay half the bills

380
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,640
 and we can have sex.

381
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,200
 You're not walking through what it looks like

382
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,240
 to walk through infertility.

383
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,960
 You're not getting up in the middle of the night with kids.

384
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,760
 You're not like saving up for retirement income

385
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,000
 and having to work through conflict.

386
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,880
 It's not preparing you for marriage.

387
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,800
 Statistically, living together,

388
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,840
 and I know this is gonna wreck a lot of people's worlds

389
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,220
 or anger a lot of people,

390
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,100
 is increasing the likelihood of you getting a divorce.

391
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,720
 And there's studies that have come out and been like,

392
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,920
 oh man, that's not exactly clear.

393
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,960
 The most recent studies that have come out have said

394
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,200
 it increases your likelihood of getting a divorce

395
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,400
 if you live together before marriage.

396
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,760
 And here's why.

397
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,280
 Because sociologists, 'cause people are beginning to study,

398
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,260
 like how could that be?

399
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,240
 That's so counterintuitive.

400
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,340
 Non-Christians going, it's so interesting.

401
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,680
 You live together before marriage,

402
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,760
 that's gotta be the next step.

403
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,560
 How could that not increase the likelihood

404
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,400
 of you succeeding?

405
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,080
 Like how could it have the inverse effect

406
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,140
 and make it likely that you're gonna end up breaking up?

407
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,280
 And sociologists have termed,

408
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,500
 one of the leading reasons why they think

409
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,700
 is because whenever you begin to live together,

410
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,740
 you kind of slide into marriage

411
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,820
 versus deciding to get married.

412
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,740
 Let me explain it like this.

413
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,700
 Like you end up getting a house, you're there,

414
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,380
 we're like, we're moving in, we're splitting rent,

415
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,580
 and you begin to make decisions that kind of yoke

416
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,940
 and intertwine your life together

417
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,220
 that make it harder to decide,

418
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,020
 I don't think this should keep going forward.

419
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,460
 You get a phone bill and you're like,

420
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,520
 man, this is too high.

421
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,740
 Let's share our phone plan.

422
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,720
 You get a phone plan together

423
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,760
 and now you're living together,

424
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,600
 you're sharing your AT&T phone plan.

425
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,500
 Then you're like, you know what?

426
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,780
 I saw these puppies at the park.

427
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,620
 I think we should get a dog.

428
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,260
 You bring home a dog named Princess,

429
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,260
 it's a little bulldog.

430
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,420
 And then you got this, you're like, we're parents together.

431
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,940
 And all of a sudden, your life gets closer

432
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,560
 and closer and closer.

433
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,260
 You co-sign on a car that you're gonna lease

434
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,100
 and step by step, without even realizing it,

435
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,460
 you're like, I've just put so much

436
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,220
 relational equity into this.

437
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,420
 And I see some red flags.

438
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,400
 I'm not exactly sure they're the right person,

439
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,740
 but it just feels like we're already pot committed.

440
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,820
 Might as well get married.

441
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,740
 And rather than going, hey, I can clearly think through this,

442
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,260
 they have the qualities that I see in a person,

443
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,340
 they're a godly person,

444
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,620
 I will make the decision to get married.

445
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,420
 You just kind of slide into marriage.

446
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,320
 And they're saying that is why there's likelier,

447
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,940
 or likely, the explanation for the greater divorce increase.

448
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,300
 What do I mean by that?

449
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,980
 There's certain things in life it's okay to slide into

450
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,540
 and it's not gonna be that expensive or costly in the end.

451
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,300
 Things like a subscription.

452
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,840
 This happens all the time, or at least happens to me.

453
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,900
 Like Disney Plus, when that came out,

454
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,460
 any Disney Plus people in the room?

455
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,380
 Four of you guys.

456
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,900
 When you have kids, that's your jam, man.

457
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,420
 And we signed up in November, got Disney Plus,

458
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,860
 it was like seven day trial,

459
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,840
 and then they always get you

460
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,100
 'cause you put your information in

461
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,960
 and then seven days goes by and you forget,

462
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,280
 oh yeah, I signed up for that thing.

463
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,700
 And I just kind of slid in without even realizing it

464
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,900
 and now I've got a subscription,

465
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,660
 still need to go in there and cancel.

466
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,040
 But at the end of the day,

467
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,840
 me sliding versus kind of deciding,

468
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,620
 honey, we're gonna get the Disney thing,

469
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,400
 is not that costly.

470
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,240
 It's seven bucks a month.

471
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,560
 You sliding into marriage is incredibly costly.

472
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,660
 And the story that you're gonna have,

473
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,220
 the story you're gonna tell your kids,

474
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,200
 story that you're gonna live with,

475
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,320
 you are writing right now,

476
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,320
 and if it includes you living together and playing marriage,

477
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,020
 you are living disobedient to the scripture,

478
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,380
 you are increasing the likelihood of you getting a divorce,

479
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,220
 and I know you're going,

480
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,340
 hey, not us, that won't be our story.

481
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,900
 And there may be some story out there that you're like,

482
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,100
 hey, my family did it, or my parents did it,

483
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,400
 and it was okay with them.

484
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,140
 Being an exception to the rule

485
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,340
 doesn't mean that your parents' marriage was thriving

486
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,000
 and experiencing everything God intended

487
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,260
 marriage to experience.

488
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:34,340
 The fourth way you can ruin love in 10 ways this decade

489
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,420
 is search for the best.

490
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,500
 Search for the best,

491
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,700
 this really applies to, I guess, everybody,

492
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,180
 but people that are in significant relationships.

493
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,060
 What does this look like?

494
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,740
 Today, we live in a day and age

495
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,140
 where I can search for the best on virtually anything.

496
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,580
 Like, if I wanna go have the best seafood in town,

497
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,400
 what do I do?

498
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,540
 I pull out my phone, I go to Yelp,

499
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,000
 type in best seafood around,

500
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,160
 then I find the top 10 list, go to that one,

501
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,220
 highest reviews.

502
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,500
 I'm not going to a three star, go to a five star.

503
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,400
 Go to that five star, sit down at the restaurant,

504
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,260
 then what can I do?

505
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,900
 I can find out what the best food

506
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,060
 at that best restaurant is.

507
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,140
 So I pull in tips, and I'm looking up

508
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,740
 all the different things that I can eat.

509
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,500
 We live in a time where it's never been easier

510
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,280
 to kind of have awareness of what options are out there

511
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,300
 and selecting the best.

512
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,020
 Amazon, used to be a day and age

513
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,500
 where if I wanted a microwave,

514
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
 I'd go to Sears, be like,

515
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,380
 "Hey, which one of these will last,

516
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,520
 "you know, hopefully beyond a year?"

517
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,700
 Today, I pull up Amazon, and I just go highest rated,

518
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,860
 and I pick it out there.

519
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,740
 Search for the best.

520
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,440
 I'm not settling, I'm an American.

521
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,680
 Let's do this.

522
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,960
 That translates,

523
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,260
 and can transfer over into the way

524
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,140
 that a lot of us think about dating without realizing it.

525
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,140
 So we begin to think like, "Dude, hey, you know,

526
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,500
 "I'm dating her, she's fine.

527
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,340
 "There's something about her

528
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,420
 "that kind of annoys me a little bit,

529
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,420
 "and you know, she's blonde, I really like brunettes."

530
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,640
 And I begin to go, "Maybe there's somebody out there

531
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,740
 "that's better out there,

532
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,060
 "so I'm gonna go find this person."

533
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,760
 And I begin to search, going,

534
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,600
 "I'm looking for someone

535
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,820
 "who's the most compatible person out there."

536
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,060
 And as we've said before,

537
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,460
 the reason that's a bad idea is one,

538
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,020
 you'll never accomplish it.

539
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,840
 If you're looking for like

540
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,020
 the single most compatible person on the planet,

541
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,720
 you probably won't find them.

542
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,200
 Statistically, they're in China.

543
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,600
 They got a billion people over there,

544
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,700
 so their odds are not in your favor there.

545
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,260
 And beyond that, there's always gonna be something

546
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,500
 that is gonna be wrong with them,

547
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,580
 just like there's always something wrong with you.

548
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,840
 So searching for the best is a bad idea.

549
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,880
 Searching for someone who has the best qualities,

550
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,640
 according to God, is the best hope and option that you have.

551
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,460
 Searching for the best is a bad idea,

552
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,080
 and searching for someone who has the best qualities

553
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,240
 that are the qualities that God says is best

554
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,200
 is your best option.

555
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,820
 In Proverbs 31, verse 10, it says,

556
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,160
 "A spouse with noble character, who can find,"

557
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,960
 like, dude, that is rare.

558
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,840
 "They are more valuable than rubies or than wealth."

559
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,440
 They are of tremendous wealth.

560
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,440
 If you find them, you hold onto someone who has character.

561
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,340
 I remember sitting down, and I remember dating my wife,

562
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,780
 and I remember being in a place where I was like,

563
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,620
 "Man, I just don't know.

564
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,880
 "Like, is this the person?"

565
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,880
 And I had a close friend that was, like, in a community,

566
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,720
 godly guy, who was like, "Hey, look, so you're wondering,

567
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,700
 "are they the most compatible?

568
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,320
 "Let me answer, no.

569
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,160
 "There probably is somebody out there who's more compatible

570
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,240
 "in whatever way today in this season

571
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,600
 "you define compatibility.

572
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,080
 "They may like, you know, the Astros,

573
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,340
 "you know, close to the way that you do,

574
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,260
 "or long suffer with the Aggies in a way that, you know,

575
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,640
 "you do," and that joke didn't make sense

576
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,920
 to anybody in here but the Aggies,

577
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,120
 but you got me, people.

578
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,220
 Or that has whatever qualifications today

579
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,440
 as you define compatibility.

580
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,200
 So yes, that person is out there.

581
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,320
 That's a terrible question.

582
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,360
 You need to ask, does this woman have the qualities

583
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,520
 and characteristics that I want to spend my life with,

584
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,840
 characteristics that God says is best?

585
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,880
 And if you're out there and you're dating,

586
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,800
 and you're like, "Man, are we the most compatible?"

587
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,320
 That is a bad question.

588
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,120
 A better question is, does this person have the character

589
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,160
 of someone that I wanna marry,

590
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,440
 that I want my children to be like,

591
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,040
 that I want my children to be raised by?

592
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,040
 The fourth, fifth way you can lose at love this decade

593
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,140
 is jump from relationship to relationship.

594
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,240
 This one is hard because if you're this person,

595
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,600
 you don't think you're this person.

596
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,840
 But you're the person in the room

597
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,720
 who's always talking to somebody.

598
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,040
 You're on dating apps, probably right now,

599
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,780
 and you are always in a relationship with someone.

600
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,760
 You never have time where you're single,

601
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,200
 and if you are single, it kinda drives you nuts

602
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,480
 'cause you're like, "Man, I'm just trying to get back

603
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,080
 "into a relationship."

604
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,640
 And there's probably something,

605
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,240
 haven't done this a while, really unhealthy

606
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,060
 that you're feeding through those relationships

607
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,240
 a codependency.

608
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,680
 A lot of times, it comes out of a need

609
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,720
 that I just need affirmation or attention from girls,

610
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,520
 or I just need a guy to tell me that I'm pretty.

611
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,160
 There's some type of discontentment and insecurity

612
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,200
 that is in your life.

613
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,080
 And if you're jumping from one relationship to the next,

614
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,280
 you're never healing,

615
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,880
 and you're probably gonna miss out,

616
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,240
 because you're not healing,

617
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,200
 on becoming the type of person,

618
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,080
 type of godly guy or godly girl who has the character

619
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,000
 that a godly guy or godly girl is gonna be looking for.

620
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,400
 The scriptures say that contentment is a mark

621
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,220
 that through a relationship with Christ,

622
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,460
 we as believers know, I'm not defined

623
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,880
 by having a dating status on my Facebook.

624
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,160
 I'm not defined by having a relationship.

625
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,240
 I don't need somebody to define me.

626
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,200
 I know my identity is secure in Christ, and I'm content.

627
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,880
 Paul in Philippians chapter four,

628
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,000
 verse 12 and 13 said, "I have learned the secret

629
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,500
 "of being content, whether I'm single,

630
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,100
 "whether I'm married, whether I'm employed,

631
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,440
 "whatever the circumstance, in every situation,

632
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,520
 "whether I'm living in plenty or in want,

633
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,180
 "I can do all of this through Christ,

634
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,000
 "who gives me strength."

635
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,520
 One of the qualities and characteristics of a godly spouse,

636
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,720
 if you're looking for someone,

637
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,800
 you should ask the question,

638
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,680
 are they jumping from one relationship to the next,

639
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,440
 the next, the next?

640
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,640
 Like, did we start talking

641
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,920
 when they were still dating somebody?

642
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,560
 If so, you should be concerned.

643
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:18,040
 All right, number six, focus on chemistry over character.

644
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,160
 Focus on chemistry over character.

645
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,900
 Chemistry is like the nicest way

646
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,560
 that I could put a combination of like electricity

647
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,840
 and they got good curves,

648
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
 and you kinda like, you know,

649
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,480
 just some of their personality,

650
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,040
 and when you're around, it's like electricity's

651
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,800
 moving back and forth between the two of you,

652
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,080
 and there's just something there.

653
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,980
 And we focus on that over character.

654
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,280
 You are focusing on a thing

655
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,680
 that will not be a part of your relationship always,

656
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,480
 and will change with different seasons in your life.

657
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,380
 Why do I say that?

658
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,320
 Chemistry really is, it's kinda,

659
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,620
 whether that means like, hey man, sex is really good,

660
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,240
 or just like, you know,

661
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,340
 there's butterflies constantly when I'm around her,

662
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,520
 will not be something that lasts

663
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,780
 and is strong enough to make a relationship last.

664
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,440
 In other words, that won't always be there,

665
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,700
 and hopefully you guys know that, but think about that.

666
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,680
 If that's the reason where you're like,

667
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,600
 yes, every time we're together,

668
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,840
 it's just like such good vibes,

669
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,840
 I just feel the energy, that's not gonna be there.

670
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,720
 Like, think about in dating relationships,

671
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,240
 if you've ever dated somebody and you've broken up,

672
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,100
 you've seen that, yeah, chemistry can come and go.

673
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,440
 Like, there's somebody that when you first,

674
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,660
 you're like at the movie theater,

675
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,920
 moving your hand towards each other,

676
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,640
 just touching pinkies, and you're like,

677
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,740
 and it's overwhelming.

678
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,640
 (congregation laughing)

679
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,680
 And you date a little bit, and then all of a sudden,

680
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,160
 you're like, I don't wanna be in a relationship

681
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,140
 with this woman, and you don't feel anything towards them.

682
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,360
 You're like, dude, I don't care,

683
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,220
 I feel nothing other than like, just bitterness, probably.

684
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,160
 That chemistry came and it went.

685
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,720
 And say, well, that happens in marriage,

686
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,960
 there's seasons, there's times

687
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,520
 where you're going through life,

688
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,900
 and it won't always be there,

689
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,820
 but what will be there is character.

690
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:01,240
 In Proverbs chapter 12, verse four,

691
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,320
 Solomon warns young men,

692
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,160
 a wife of noble character is her husband's crown,

693
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,840
 but a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones.

694
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,680
 That's Solomon's nice way of saying,

695
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,520
 if you have a wife that doesn't have character,

696
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,440
 it's gonna be like you're dying on the inside

697
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,760
 for the rest of your marriage.

698
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,980
 If you have a husband that doesn't have character,

699
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,240
 it's gonna be like a slow death from the inside

700
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,600
 for the rest of your marriage.

701
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,160
 We've said before, it is so much better

702
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,120
 to be lonely and single today

703
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,180
 than lonely and married tomorrow.

704
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,040
 And there, thank you, preach.

705
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,080
 (congregation laughing)

706
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,520
 If I do say so myself.

707
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,320
 There are a lot of people who get married,

708
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,280
 and they're experiencing an even deeper loneliness

709
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,080
 in that marriage, 'cause there's no hope of,

710
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,560
 man, maybe someday this'll be fixed.

711
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,560
 And you can lose love and lose at love

712
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,600
 if you focus on chemistry over character.

713
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,360
 Number seven, project past hurts.

714
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,440
 And this one is huge if you are in a dating relationship.

715
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,560
 You gotta work through past hurts.

716
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,840
 Past hurts, whether they be from family or friends

717
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,600
 or past dating relationships,

718
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,440
 because if you don't practice forgiveness,

719
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,280
 you're not ready to get married.

720
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,440
 Like marriage is one long I forgive you

721
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,820
 after I forgive you after I forgive you.

722
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,960
 And it's all towards someone who deeply hurts you,

723
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,840
 who you deeply love.

724
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,480
 And if you can't forgive,

725
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,840
 whatever things are in a part of your story today

726
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,040
 or in your past, you're not ready to move past that.

727
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,200
 So you gotta deal with that baggage,

728
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,360
 or else that baggage is gonna come back up again,

729
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,760
 like some of us in the room, we carry around stuff,

730
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,160
 and you've basically, understandably,

731
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,040
 you were wronged and you were really hurt.

732
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,880
 And you haven't dealt with that

733
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,720
 and you haven't forgiven that person.

734
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,480
 And when you carry that,

735
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,720
 it's like you carry a bag of bitterness around with you.

736
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,600
 And the more that you have a bag of bitterness around,

737
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,240
 it makes it easier to pick up other things

738
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,640
 and put it in there.

739
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,600
 Like some of us have walked through life,

740
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,520
 and the things that you're holding onto

741
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,320
 represent past relationships.

742
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,080
 Like a guy cheated on you your sophomore year of college,

743
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,200
 and you don't trust people anymore.

744
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,760
 And that's why you're always around,

745
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,880
 or the girl cheated on you,

746
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,920
 and so every time you're dating,

747
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,080
 you're like, I need to see your phone,

748
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,000
 I need to see it right now,

749
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,640
 I wanna know exactly why I saw you

750
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,600
 talking to Sandra over there.

751
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,920
 And you're like, well, Sandra's my cousin.

752
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,320
 (congregation laughing)

753
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,160
 And you've gotta deal with it.

754
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,360
 Others, maybe some of the hurts,

755
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,000
 and again, I get it, man, they're all understandable.

756
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,840
 They come from just family or parent or father wounds,

757
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,000
 or a mom who wasn't around,

758
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,320
 or maybe a dad who never said that they loved you.

759
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,760
 And you've gotta carry that scar,

760
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,840
 and it manifests itself in different ways,

761
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,280
 but you've never dealt with it.

762
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,560
 You've never forgiven your parents.

763
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,800
 And before you take the next step,

764
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,800
 you need to forgive family, siblings, parents.

765
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,160
 I mean, forgive, like, I forgive you,

766
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,200
 you never came to my sport games.

767
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,040
 I forgive you that you were never around.

768
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,080
 I forgive you that you were angry all the time.

769
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,120
 And I'm choosing 'cause God in Christ has forgiven me,

770
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,840
 and the scriptures command me, I have to extend forgiveness.

771
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,080
 And I forgive you, like I was forgiven.

772
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:41,000
 Others, it may just be related to trust issues in general,

773
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,080
 or broken trust from friends, like, just,

774
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,880
 that betrayed you, that lied about you,

775
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,960
 that left you out, that hurt you.

776
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,960
 Whatever those hurts are, walking through and walking through,

777
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,200
 I'm gonna choose to forgive.

778
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,440
 I don't wanna carry around the bag,

779
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,760
 because if I carry that bag around,

780
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,800
 I'm gonna bring it into marriage, and I'm gonna,

781
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,360
 I promise you, you're gonna put things in that bag.

782
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,920
 Maybe the hardest one is gonna be working through abuse.

783
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,600
 Statistically, one in four people in this room

784
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,960
 were abused in some way, and it wasn't your fault,

785
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,960
 and it wasn't right,

786
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,840
 and forgiving them doesn't make it right.

787
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,320
 But you're gonna carry that into marriage,

788
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,400
 and it's gonna impact your love life, and your sex life,

789
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,240
 and your marriage life, and all that.

790
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,080
 And you know what, that's not fair, it's not.

791
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,520
 But it's also true.

792
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,360
 And the best gift you can give your spouse today

793
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,480
 is beginning, I'm gonna work through some of the baggage.

794
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,760
 I don't wanna carry this anymore.

795
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,000
 I don't wanna bring this into my marriage,

796
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 'cause I know, if I'm holding onto stuff now,

797
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,760
 you're gonna hold onto stuff later.

798
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,280
 Colossians chapter three, verse 13,

799
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,840
 is one of tons of verses that says,

800
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,200
 forgive one another if any of you

801
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,320
 has a grievance against someone.

802
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,520
 Forgive as the Lord forgave you.

803
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:09,240
 The eighth way you can lose at love

804
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,560
 is that you can isolate your relationship.

805
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,120
 If you are the only person in your life,

806
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,560
 other than the person you're dating,

807
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,560
 who is celebrating, and excited about,

808
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,040
 and knows about your dating relationship,

809
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,520
 you should be concerned.

810
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,080
 If you're the couple, we all have seen this couple,

811
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,080
 that they come together, and they start dating,

812
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,360
 and it's just like they submarine.

813
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,320
 They disappear, and they'll resurface at some point,

814
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,680
 and you haven't seen them in forever.

815
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,400
 They just become the couple that they only hang out

816
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,880
 with one another, they're constantly around each other.

817
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,760
 And it's not a bad thing to like being with each other,

818
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,800
 and like being around each other,

819
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,680
 but if no one else in your life knows the relationship,

820
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,200
 is celebrating the relationship,

821
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,040
 if there's no godly counsel in your life,

822
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,800
 or community that is celebrating,

823
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,000
 saying, hey, this is a good thing.

824
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,080
 Yeah, I see you guys working well together.

825
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,560
 I think this is a great relationship.

826
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,660
 I celebrate that.

827
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,120
 You should be concerned at best.

828
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,360
 Proverbs chapter 18, verse one says,

829
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,880
 whoever isolates their relationship,

830
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,040
 seeks their own desire, or isolates themself.

831
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,060
 They seek their own desires,

832
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,860
 they break out against all sound judgment,

833
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,820
 or all like rational wisdom.

834
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,100
 They kind of lash out against that,

835
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,140
 'cause they're like, I'm gonna do what I want to do.

836
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,720
 If you are isolating your relationship,

837
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,920
 you should be concerned.

838
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:32,740
 Ninth way, have sex when you're ready.

839
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,760
 Have sex when you're ready.

840
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,360
 This feels like the nicest way for culture to say,

841
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,000
 just don't be a hussy,

842
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,700
 but have sex whenever you think it's best.

843
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,040
 Because, I mean, what does that even mean?

844
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,160
 I feel like I was born ready.

845
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,480
 Or like, by 12 years old, I was like,

846
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,120
 yeah, I feel like I'm ready, all right.

847
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,320
 (congregation laughing)

848
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,840
 The answer all of us would give across the room

849
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,920
 would be entirely different.

850
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,960
 What does that even mean?

851
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,980
 Hey, have sex whenever you're ready.

852
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,760
 That's a terrible standard.

853
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,600
 And yet, if you turn on and listen to any pop culture today,

854
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,600
 the most throttled version of sexuality is like,

855
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,520
 hey, I'm just waiting, Colton from The Bachelor,

856
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,960
 I'm waiting 'til I find that right person, then I'm in.

857
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,220
 That's a terrible idea.

858
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,760
 Biblically, it's a terrible idea,

859
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,920
 because the scriptures say that at a soul level,

860
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,480
 every time you have sex with someone,

861
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,000
 you are touching that person,

862
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,860
 and they are touching and impacting you

863
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,820
 at the deepest part of your heart,

864
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,640
 unlike any other sin in your life.

865
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,480
 First Corinthians chapter six, verse 18 says,

866
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,160
 "Flee all sex outside of marriage.

867
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:42,700
 "All other sins a person commits are outside the body,

868
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,560
 "but whoever sins sexually sins against their own body.

869
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,820
 "Do you not know that your bodies are temples

870
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,100
 "of the Holy Spirit who's in you,

871
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,180
 "whom you have received from God?

872
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,960
 "You're not your own, you were bought with a price.

873
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,040
 "Therefore, honor God with your body."

874
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,000
 Biblically, God is not anti-sex, he's so pro-sex,

875
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,680
 and dude, when you get married, here's what I'm confident.

876
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,340
 Married people have way more sex than you guys

877
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,840
 if you're single, it's true.

878
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,240
 God's not opposed to sex, he wants you to experience that,

879
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,480
 and because he's so pro-sex, he wants it to be

880
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,840
 in the confines of a marriage that is safe and secure,

881
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,720
 where you don't have to put out

882
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,280
 in order for somebody to stay,

883
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,520
 but where you lovingly give yourself to one another

884
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:30,240
 in the context of an unbreakable bond and covenant.

885
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,960
 Having sex when you're ready is a terrible idea,

886
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,880
 having sex within marriage is a great one,

887
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,440
 but if you wanna lose at love, you should have sex.

888
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,880
 The last one, believe that love

889
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,300
 is something that you fall into.

890
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,960
 We talk about love in a funny way, you know?

891
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,300
 We're like, man, then I just fell in love,

892
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,760
 as though it's like a puddle or something

893
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,320
 you kind of drifted into.

894
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,880
 This unstoppable force that kind of came out of nowhere

895
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,060
 and there I was and I was just doing my life, running along,

896
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,800
 and then I saw her and whoa, we spent time together

897
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,940
 and now all my hobbies have changed

898
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,520
 and the hills are alive with the sound of music

899
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,220
 and just fell in.

900
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,600
 The reason that's a really bad idea

901
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,520
 is because if you believe love is something

902
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,200
 you can fall into, you also believe love

903
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,420
 is something you can fall out of.

904
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,200
 The reason the divorce rate is as high as it is

905
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,480
 is because our culture believes,

906
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,320
 like man, I just fell out of love.

907
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,920
 As though love is something you can fall into

908
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,800
 and you can fall out of.

909
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,360
 Biblically, love is not something

910
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,340
 that you fall in or fall out of.

911
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,240
 It is something you live out.

912
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,060
 And you particularly live it out in the context of marriage.

913
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,820
 It involves acting.

914
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,200
 Like we have our timeline off.

915
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,680
 The timeline that most people have is like,

916
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,080
 hey, we dated, we fell in love, then we got married.

917
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,280
 A better timeline is that, hey, we dated,

918
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,120
 we saw this as something that,

919
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,760
 we were both on the same page, character, the qualities,

920
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,480
 I saw all the things God said, this is the right move,

921
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,360
 others around us celebrated that relationship,

922
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,160
 we got engaged, we got married,

923
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,720
 and you know what happens then?

924
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,160
 Then the loving begins.

925
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,600
 Because love is something that takes sacrifice,

926
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,480
 that takes work, takes all types

927
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,240
 of descriptive terms biblically.

928
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,800
 The best passage, or most extensive passage on love,

929
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,360
 you've probably heard at a bunch of weddings,

930
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,320
 is this, from 1 Corinthians chapter 13, verse four.

931
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,880
 Love is patient.

932
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,720
 Think about these things.

933
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,700
 You don't fall into patience, you choose to be patient.

934
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,240
 Love is kind, kindness.

935
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:36,740
 It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.

936
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,980
 It does not dishonor others.

937
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,220
 It is not self-seeking.

938
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,380
 It is not easily angered.

939
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,380
 It does not keep any record of wrongs.

940
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,380
 That means love chooses, I forgive you,

941
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,140
 I'm not holding this against you.

942
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,620
 That is entirely action.

943
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,980
 That's what that means.

944
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,300
 There's been a wrong, and I'm choosing,

945
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,440
 despite the fact that I was wronged,

946
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,780
 I'm not holding onto that.

947
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,540
 It's not some emotional-led decision,

948
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,940
 that is, I'm deciding to do that.

949
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,860
 It's what love is.

950
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,640
 It's something that you live out, not that you fall in.

951
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,380
 Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.

952
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,800
 Love always protects.

953
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,100
 Love always trusts, it always hopes, or believes the best.

954
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,700
 It always perseveres, love never fails.

955
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,420
 All of these, biblically, love,

956
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:32,460
 biblically, involves these attitudes and actions

957
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,300
 in your life, not this emotional overflowing and feeling.

958
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,020
 The idea of first comes love, then comes marriage,

959
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:43,020
 then comes baby carriage, is, hey, we date,

960
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,920
 we got married, then love begins,

961
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,740
 because it's in that context that I have to choose.

962
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,580
 I'm gonna die to myself and put your needs before my own.

963
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,820
 And my wife dies to herself and says,

964
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,780
 I'm putting the needs of the other person before my own.

965
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,740
 You can't even fully live out love until you're married.

966
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,740
 We get the progression off.

967
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,820
 Once you get married, that's when the love begins

968
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:07,200
 and deciding, I'm choosing to die to myself to love you.

969
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,060
 Biblically, that's what love is.

970
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,720
 It's not some emotional, overflowing experience.

971
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,660
 The apostle Paul, you know how he ends this passage?

972
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,180
 It's really fascinating.

973
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,940
 Second, about love, and then out of left field,

974
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,580
 he begins to talk about his childhood,

975
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,460
 where you're like, love is this and love is this,

976
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,740
 and he's like, when I was a boy, and here's what he says.

977
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,740
 When I was a child, I talked like a child,

978
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,760
 thought like a child, I reasoned like a child.

979
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,580
 When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me.

980
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,300
 In other words, in the context of love,

981
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,060
 it's almost as though Paul is saying,

982
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,340
 hey, there's a lot of myths people believe about love.

983
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,860
 Like, they believe in the fairy tale,

984
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,700
 got Cupid over there firing arrows.

985
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,700
 There's a lot of crazy stuff people believe,

986
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,740
 but when I became a man, I put those away,

987
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,940
 and I began to accept the truth,

988
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,380
 and I put childish things behind me.

989
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,300
 Love is the decision that I make to die to self

990
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,860
 in the context of marriage over and over and over and over.

991
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,260
 It's not always easy, doesn't always come easy,

992
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,020
 but that is what marriage is,

993
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,540
 and I know that I'm ready for marriage when I decide,

994
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,140
 man, I'm ready to love through the actions

995
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,500
 that Scripture calls me to.

996
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,420
 Here's the summary one more time.

997
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,940
 If you wanna lose at love in 10 ways,

998
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,460
 date for fun, make exceptions, 'cause they're exceptional,

999
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,260
 play like you're married, search for the best,

1000
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,780
 jump from relationship to relationship,

1001
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,980
 focus on chemistry over character,

1002
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,340
 don't deal with past hurts, isolate your relationship,

1003
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,660
 and have sex when you're ready,

1004
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,380
 and believe love is something that you fall into.

1005
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,220
 We close here.

1006
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,700
 Maybe the biggest lie, or one of the biggest two lies,

1007
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,140
 or just kind of two directions, maybe we'll take it,

1008
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,540
 is some of you are believing you can reject

1009
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,780
 and do as many of those as you want and not lose at love,

1010
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,060
 and you have bought a lie,

1011
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:05,060
 and someday you're gonna wake up,

1012
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,280
 and you're gonna go, how did I get here?

1013
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,740
 The love story I hoped I would experience

1014
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,700
 is not the love story that's getting written around me,

1015
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,140
 and I feel like I may even be past kind of the stage

1016
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,820
 of even when I would fall into that love story.

1017
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,720
 Others of you, you're in the room,

1018
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,860
 and you believe that, man,

1019
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,140
 because you've broken one of these,

1020
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,860
 you're too far, and you're too damaged goods,

1021
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,740
 and the love story God has for you can't be something

1022
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:32,020
 where if you will turn and surrender life

1023
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,380
 and your love story to Him, He'll write one out of that,

1024
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,220
 more beautiful than anything that you could have imagined,

1025
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,880
 and you think you're too damaged of goods,

1026
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,580
 and the God who's there doesn't look at it like that.

1027
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,640
 The choice is yours and mine.

1028
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,360
 Am I gonna decide to follow His way or not?

1029
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,320
 It's like this.

1030
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,080
 My wife and I have been recently looking for,

1031
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,480
 like on a mattress search.

1032
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,080
 We've had the same one for years,

1033
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,000
 and we have, you know, came across the bed-in-a-box thing,

1034
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,320
 found mattresses that they'll ship right to your door.

1035
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,520
 Really interesting, and we've gone through four of 'em.

1036
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,360
 We went through the Purple, through the Lisa,

1037
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,360
 Casper, Helix, and here's the deal.

1038
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,320
 You get 'em, you're gonna sleep on 'em,

1039
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,820
 and you get a 100-night trial, totally free.

1040
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,200
 Like if you don't want it, no questions asked, return.

1041
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,260
 365-day trial on one of 'em, no questions asked, return.

1042
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,700
 And we went through it, and we kind of were sleeping

1043
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,060
 on these different mattresses,

1044
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,540
 and each time the same thing happens.

1045
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,440
 Really interesting.

1046
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,220
 We call, and it's like, man, this one's too hot,

1047
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,940
 and this one's too cold, and this, you know,

1048
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,580
 porridge, three little bears.

1049
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,780
 But we call, and we're like, I wanna return this.

1050
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,740
 And they've said the same thing each time.

1051
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,580
 They're like, okay, great.

1052
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,980
 Well, if you just donate it to a charity of your choice

1053
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,740
 and send us a receipt, that's fine.

1054
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,660
 In other words, they're like, because you used it,

1055
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,680
 that thing is so worthless to us now

1056
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,300
 that we won't even come get it.

1057
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,960
 So just get rid of it, and do whatever you want with it,

1058
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,240
 and that's it.

1059
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,100
 We don't even care to come and get it back.

1060
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,260
 You've been sleeping on it.

1061
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,000
 It's used, it's not worth it.

1062
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,140
 In so many ways, that's such a reflection

1063
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,760
 of like the dating culture that we live in.

1064
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,320
 In our world, that wants you to have

1065
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,220
 that romantic love story at the same time

1066
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,860
 also chastises you and makes you feel like damaged goods

1067
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,600
 if a part of your story didn't always work out

1068
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,440
 the right way.

1069
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,620
 You got an STD, you had an abortion in your past,

1070
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,420
 you had sexual dysfunction in your past,

1071
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,400
 maybe there was sexual abuse,

1072
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,520
 and you can feel like damaged goods that, hey,

1073
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,180
 everyone around me feels like, reiterates,

1074
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,320
 I'm used, I'm worthless, I'm abused.

1075
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,080
 And the message of the Bible is that despite any of these

1076
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,080
 being broken in your past, your story doesn't have

1077
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,840
 to be over, and that a godly guy or a godly girl

1078
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,440
 is not exempt from you no matter,

1079
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,800
 listen very closely to me, no matter your story,

1080
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,720
 it does not have to be the case that, hey,

1081
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,160
 a godly guy would never have interest in you,

1082
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,720
 or a godly girl would never have interest in you.

1083
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,560
 If you believe that, you have bought a lie,

1084
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,280
 because the New Testament really tells us

1085
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,960
 that anyone who's a godly guy is gonna act like Christ.

1086
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,400
 How did Christ act towards people

1087
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,500
 who had sexual dysfunction in their past?

1088
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,000
 We're actually told.

1089
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,640
 He looked at a woman who had sexual dysfunction

1090
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,600
 taking place in her present.

1091
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,200
 He's teaching one morning, he's at the temple,

1092
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,120
 in John chapter eight, he's sitting there

1093
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,320
 and he's teaching, and they bring this woman

1094
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,440
 who'd been caught in the act of adultery,

1095
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,880
 caught in the midst of having sex with not her husband,

1096
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,680
 with some other man, and they drag her,

1097
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,600
 and they throw her in the middle of Jesus's message

1098
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,720
 right in front of everybody.

1099
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,020
 How does the Son of God respond to a woman

1100
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:32,020
 clearly guilty of sexual sin, dysfunctional relationship?

1101
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,700
 How does God respond?

1102
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:39,540
 We're told that he looks at the men,

1103
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:44,120
 and the men yell out, the law says

1104
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,360
 we should condemn her to death.

1105
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,840
 They call for the death penalty.

1106
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,820
 How do you respond, Jesus?

1107
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:56,360
 Jesus kneels down on the ground.

1108
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,620
 He begins to write something in the dirt.

1109
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,280
 We're not even told what he wrote.

1110
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,420
 Draws with his finger, and then he stands up,

1111
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:13,540
 and he says, let him without sin throw the first stone.

1112
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:17,820
 And then he kneels back down

1113
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,460
 and starts writing on the ground.

1114
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,420
 What?

1115
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,380
 Jesus, she's an adulteress.

1116
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,300
 She's ruining a family's life.

1117
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,420
 She's caught in the middle of having sex with somebody else,

1118
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,940
 and you're perfect, holy God, you look at her

1119
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,140
 despite the law calling for the death penalty,

1120
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,860
 and you say, hey, if you're without sin, you can do it.

1121
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,700
 You know the answer.

1122
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,780
 You know they have sin in their life.

1123
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,880
 They can't do that.

1124
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,520
 And he kneels back down, and he gets writing in the dirt.

1125
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,340
 And we're told that the oldest to the youngest,

1126
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:53,020
 they walk away, and now it's just Jesus and the woman.

1127
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,380
 He's kneeled on the ground.

1128
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,620
 And he looks up, and you gotta think

1129
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,220
 this woman's covered in tears and who else,

1130
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,300
 who knows what else?

1131
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:04,780
 And he looks her in the eyes, and he says,

1132
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,080
 does no one condemn you?

1133
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:11,740
 And she responds, no one.

1134
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:18,260
 And Jesus says, go and leave your life of sin.

1135
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:22,900
 I don't condemn, and I don't condone,

1136
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,620
 but I'm gonna be crucified on a cross for sin like this,

1137
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:30,760
 and there is no sin that makes you so unwanted by me.

1138
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,540
 You're not used and damaged and abused goods,

1139
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:36,140
 and a godly guy and a godly girl

1140
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,900
 will see you with the eyes of Jesus,

1141
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,980
 and I so desperately want you to hear me.

1142
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,020
 Your story is not done, but you have a part in that story

1143
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,460
 of saying, God, I surrender.

1144
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,060
 I want a love story that you write.

1145
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,060
 I give you the pen, write it all over my life.

1146
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,860
 Take it, use it, I'll date however you want me to date.

1147
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,620
 I don't wanna write a story like my parents' story.

1148
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,620
 I don't wanna write a story

1149
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:00,140
 like so much of Hollywood's dysfunctional crap.

1150
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:03,660
 I want a love story that lasts, God.

1151
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,580
 And everywhere I look, the best shot I got in culture

1152
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,420
 is a coin flip.

1153
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,260
 So if that's possible, God, I surrender, take it.

1154
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:17,100
 And a godly guy, if you turn, and a godly girl,

1155
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,700
 if you say, God, I wanna walk with you,

1156
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,660
 I'm gonna walk with you, I'm gonna date like you call me to,

1157
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,020
 he's gonna look at you like Jesus looks at you.

1158
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:29,280
 Forgiven, new, whole.

1159
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,460
 But you have to make the decision what you're gonna do.

1160
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,660
 Are you gonna keep driving your own life?

1161
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,780
 'Cause if so, you're never gonna heal,

1162
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,580
 and you're never gonna have that godly guy around,

1163
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,460
 and you're gonna buy the lie that you're damaged goods,

1164
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:46,220
 so you just gotta settle for damaged Daniel.

1165
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,700
 (congregation laughing)

1166
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,980
 You don't have to, sorry, Daniel.

1167
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:55,440
 You gotta decide.

1168
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,940
 Are you gonna have a decade that roars

1169
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:01,940
 as it relates to your love life,

1170
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,580
 or are you gonna lose love in every way

1171
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,740
 when it doesn't have to be so?

1172
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:08,580
 Let me pray.

1173
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:14,660
 Father, thank you that you don't condemn

1174
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,300
 sexually immoral people like me.

1175
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,700
 You don't condone those with sexual brokenness

1176
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,420
 in our past and sexual sin, sexual relationships.

1177
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,180
 And yet also, you don't condemn

1178
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:31,300
 because you were crucified taking

1179
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,460
 all the condemnation on you.

1180
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,060
 I pray that tonight, anyone in this room

1181
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,620
 who has bought that lie, and there are many,

1182
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:42,620
 that they're too far gone, their story is too far

1183
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:47,740
 to be woven back and made new, redeemed.

1184
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,900
 Your spirit would overwhelm them now

1185
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:54,700
 and help them reject that lie.

1186
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,020
 I pray for anyone who's never trusted

1187
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:01,420
 and what you did on the cross,

1188
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,880
 perfect expression of love,

1189
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,060
 that they wouldn't lose that love

1190
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,220
 by not accepting it tonight.

1191
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,500
 And I pray for dating relationships.

1192
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,580
 God, protect those of us who are dating in the room.

1193
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:17,020
 Protect us from living in our own ways,

1194
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,820
 dating as we see fit or the world says to.

1195
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,060
 Stop marriages from happening.

1196
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,260
 Break couples up right now that need to.

1197
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,380
 Form marriages that need to.

1198
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,460
 We love you.

1199
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,900
 We worship you in song, amen.
