[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:24.480]   All right, let's go.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.000]   Welcome, friends of the room, friends in Phoenix,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.480]   in the Woodlands, El Paso, Nashville, Mint Hill,
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.560]   Austin, Texas, Houston, Texas, wherever you are joining
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.020]   and listening in all the live locations
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.400]   and everybody that is here.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.200]   Hey, we are continuing the series Roaring 20s.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.600]   Tonight, we are gonna talk about relationships,
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.780]   dating, how to make sure that you don't set yourself up
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.800]   on one of the biggest arenas of life
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.240]   to experience pain in the next 10 years of your life.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.440]   Let me start by asking this question.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.240]   What is the greatest romantic comedy of all time?
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.760]   The Notebook.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.480]   Is that a comedy?
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.740]   That's such a tragedy.
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.880]   You gotta laugh more.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.040]   What else, what is it?
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.960]   All right, I heard it.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.800]   I'm gonna go on record.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.080]   I think the greatest romantic comedy of all time
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.720]   is How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.400]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.040]   You guys remember this?
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.560]   With Kate and Matthew McConaughey, 2003,
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.080]   the dress that set off a thousand prom dresses
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.920]   across the room and across the world.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.720]   If you don't know the story, let me catch you up.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.000]   This is all going somewhere, by the way,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.560]   just not me getting off my chest, my favorite rom-com.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.520]   But the story is this.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.120]   So Kate was a columnist.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.500]   She was working for this magazine.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.480]   Think like Cosmo only, they didn't name it that
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.840]   'cause of copyright.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.080]   But she's working for this magazine.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.680]   She's got an assignment in the column.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.360]   Hey, I want you to write a article or a column
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.480]   on how to lose a guy in 10 days.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.200]   He's gotta make him fall in love with you
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.300]   and then how to get out of that relationship in 10 days.
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.340]   And then at the same time,
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.500]   Matthew is doing some diamond deal
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.000]   where he basically finds himself,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.800]   in order to get a job, he had to convince his boss,
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.040]   hey, I can sell anything, including myself.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.040]   And his boss says, all right.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.400]   And they're at the same party, coincidentally.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.720]   His boss looks over, sees Blondie, says,
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.800]   hey, I want you to go and make Blondie,
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.340]   that's not what she says, make her fall in love with you.
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.160]   And he's like, challenge accepted.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.680]   So now they've got this irrespective,
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.460]   she's gonna try to get him to lose
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.400]   or to drop him like a tot.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.540]   He's gonna find a way to make her fall in love.
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.660]   And Kate Hudson then goes into this relationship
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.580]   and does all the iconic things
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.180]   that you would think a girl would do
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.780]   to try to make a guy be like, man, this is just too much.
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.800]   You are way too extra, I'm outta here.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.900]   So that included things like getting a dog
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.740]   very quickly into the relationship.
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.420]   It's like, oh, they got a dog named Princess,
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.140]   which is one of the more ugly dogs you've ever seen.
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.660]   Burberry and all.
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.640]   It included her getting a,
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.700]   coming over during the poker night with the game.
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.420]   If you remember this moment,
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.420]   where she's there, there she is wiping his nose,
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.620]   all the guys are over.
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.100]   Included the famous love fern.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.100]   Remember this?
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.580]   That he let die and then claimed no, it was sleeping.
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.860]   I mean, there's some genius moments in the entire thing.
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.100]   And then finally, they end up meeting at that party.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.260]   And if you know the story, I won't go into all of it,
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.140]   but eventually they decide that they do wanna be together
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.240]   and she doesn't write the column
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.080]   that she would have thought of.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.460]   And there they are with the iconic moment on the bridge.
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.460]   She doesn't go to Chicago for the job
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.580]   and just the greatest rom-com of all time.
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.500]   It's one of those movies that there's some part of us
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.580]   that loves it because it's like, oh man,
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.900]   just this idea that these starstruck lovers,
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.360]   that even though they weren't trying to make it work,
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.460]   there was something inside of them
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.980]   that just couldn't keep them apart
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.740]   in this amazing love story.
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.240]   It really resonates because all of us
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.880]   want to have this love story
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.820]   that no matter the imperfections and the challenges
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.800]   and the journeys that we go along,
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.620]   we hope that one day we're gonna just kind of bump
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.620]   into that person and there they are and here I am
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.140]   and it's gonna work together
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.420]   and we're gonna make it last forever.
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.420]   And yet we live in a culture that does anything but that
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.400]   or a culture where love that lasts,
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.120]   I mean, marriages that not just stay together,
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.560]   but where two people come and they really love each other,
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.460]   they really enjoy being with one another,
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.540]   they share the same values
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.980]   where they don't end up in divorce, is increasingly rare.
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.620]   I mean, let alone the stat of like 40 to 50%
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.180]   of marriages end up in divorce
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.980]   and yet how many marriages, even the ones that don't,
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.620]   end up just in a loveless, sexless, unromantic life.
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.300]   And the God who's there doesn't want that to be your story.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.220]   He doesn't want that to be my story.
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.060]   And you may not know this,
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.500]   like if you came in the room and you're like,
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.860]   man, I would love to be in love someday and in a marriage
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.620]   and I would love that to be a part of my story,
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.860]   good news is statistically like 75% of you
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.380]   will experience that by the age of 35.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.500]   And even further good news is that the God who is there,
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.080]   he wants you to experience a romance and a marriage
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.700]   that exceeds any romantic comedy that is out there,
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.060]   beyond anything that you could even hope for yourself,
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.940]   he is committed and desires you to experience that.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.420]   But in culture, though they put up this lofty idea
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.900]   of like, man, this would be amazing,
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.100]   we celebrate that romantic comedy,
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.100]   we also have sold a bunch of lies
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.020]   that many of us have believed, many of us are living out
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.780]   and they are keeping you from experiencing
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.380]   the type of love that you want.
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.380]   So what I wanna talk about tonight,
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.220]   we're gonna fly through, I'm gonna cover 10 things,
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.700]   if you take notes, there are gonna be 10 things
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.860]   about how to lose at love in 10 ways.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.140]   How to lose at love in 10 ways.
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.380]   Over the next 10 years, listen to me very closely,
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.700]   you most likely will decide the person
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.180]   you're gonna spend the rest of your life with,
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.020]   think about that.
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.440]   Among the decisions that are most gonna impact your life,
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.960]   few, if any, other than who you're gonna trust
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.800]   as Lord and Savior, are gonna be more important
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.540]   than who you marry and covenant your life to.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.160]   And there are some real clear things that culture is saying,
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.360]   hey, this is how you should date,
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.280]   and if you date that way, you can be sure
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.520]   you will lose at love in the next 10 years.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.800]   And you'll lose at love in these 10 ways.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.720]   So we're gonna fly through, I'm gonna cover each of them
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.960]   for the next like 30 minutes,
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.400]   so we're gonna go through very quickly how to lose at love,
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.940]   this is kind of a high level, what not to do,
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.360]   we've done lots of dating series,
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.920]   you can go check out any of those on the porch app
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.440]   if you're interested in finding out more
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.640]   of the kind of proactive things to do,
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.080]   this is like, hey, you need to avoid these landmines,
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.040]   'cause if not, you're gonna lose at love in the next 10 years
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.200]   if your love life looks like one of these 10 ways.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.220]   All right, so the first one, in fact,
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.360]   let me just read all of them up top.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.840]   All right, so I'll just fly through 'em,
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.760]   hey, here's 10 ways to lose at love in the next 10 years.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.640]   Date for fun, make exceptions if they're exceptional,
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.620]   play married, search for the best,
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.660]   jump from relationship to relationship,
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.660]   focus on chemistry over character, project past hurts,
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.660]   isolate your relationship, have sex when you're ready,
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.820]   believe love is something that you fall into.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.100]   Your closing prayer right there, just ended.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.300]   (congregation laughing)
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.100]   All right, let me go through them a little bit slower.
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.760]   Date for fun, what I would say, date for fun,
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.320]   why is dating for fun a bad idea?
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.800]   This is the idea, what does this look like?
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   This looks like dating is just kind of for sport.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.060]   I'm not really ready to get married yet,
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.140]   but I also don't love not having anything to do
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.180]   on a Friday night.
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.620]   I'd love to have somebody paying for my meals
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.300]   every now and then, that kind of sounds fun.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.700]   And let's be honest, attention from the opposite sex,
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.580]   that's pretty cool.
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.080]   And so you're just in that season
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.460]   where you're dating for fun,
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.260]   you're not really interested in settling down,
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.500]   you're kind of playing the field,
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.540]   you've got 16 dating apps, you're swiping on Tinder.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.920]   Why and how could that be a bad idea?
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.020]   The Bible says in Proverbs chapter four, verse 23,
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.300]   Solomon, wisest man who ever lived,
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.800]   above everything else, it says,
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.980]   guard your heart, protect your heart,
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.260]   for it is the wellspring of life.
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.300]   That wellspring of life just means everything you do in life
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.380]   flows from your heart.
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.380]   And Solomon's like, hey, I wrote a lot of Proverbs,
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.960]   wrote Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, that was pretty cool.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.740]   But above everything else I've ever written,
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.620]   I want you to listen, Solomon would say,
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.180]   protect your heart.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.300]   Why is it a bad idea to casually date?
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.300]   Because in doing so, you are training yourself
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.940]   to give your heart away, to give small parts
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.780]   of your heart away, to give large parts of your heart away,
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.540]   and you are training yourself to break up
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.820]   and do and experience something
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.700]   God never intended your heart to experience.
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.840]   That breakup.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.300]   And everything you do in life flows from your heart.
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.540]   And so every time you casually date
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:35.900]   and you give a little bit of a way,
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.440]   you are giving away a part of your heart,
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.140]   and it's gonna impact the next relationship
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.420]   and your future marriage.
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.900]   And Solomon's gonna say, it's gonna impact
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.260]   all of your life, do not be a fool.
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.420]   And it is foolish to casually date.
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.520]   You are training yourself, not for marriage,
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.800]   but for divorce.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.220]   I mean, just like practically, think about it.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.900]   I get in a relationship, we're kind of together,
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.420]   we have all these mixed emotions,
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.660]   we fool around, we hook up, and then we break up.
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.660]   You're experiencing something
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.880]   God never intended you to experience.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.260]   You know, dating is a relatively new invention.
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.540]   It's like less than 100 years old,
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.320]   or around 100 years old.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.140]   Like, people have been driving a car and flying planes
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.280]   about the same length of time that they've been dating.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.280]   And we really haven't mastered this craft.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.460]   So if the world around us says, man, just date around,
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.820]   kind of figure out what you like,
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.300]   you are taking your cue and advice,
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.460]   and it's gonna end up with you experiencing
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.480]   losing at love in the next 10 years, 10 ways.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.660]   So the first one, dating around, dating just for sport.
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.060]   The truth is, in this time, you should be selective.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.960]   If you're not ready to get married, you should not date.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.800]   If you're not ready to get married,
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.140]   like in the next 12 months, you should not date.
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:52.040]   Second one, make exceptions if they are exceptional.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.520]   Make exceptions if they are exceptional.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.120]   Now we are just getting up in people's business.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.600]   This looks like, you're at work, you got that coworker,
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.280]   he's a cute guy, you're hanging out,
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.480]   and he's like, oh, you know,
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.400]   what are you doing this afternoon?
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.760]   You go on a date, you begin to talk about faith,
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.120]   and it's important to you,
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.580]   and you're trying to grow in your spiritual walk.
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.120]   You ask him, does he have a faith,
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.480]   or where's he at in that?
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.480]   And he describes something of like, no, not really,
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.200]   but I'm not opposed to coming to church,
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.400]   and you begin to go, oh, man, you know,
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.680]   but he's such a great guy.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.360]   He's so nice, and he's so kind,
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.000]   and he's open to coming to church.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.240]   I mean, he's not a Christian, or he's not following Jesus,
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.120]   but he's open to coming with me.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.720]   I could be a good source of light in his life.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.000]   Or it looks like you being the person who's like,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.840]   I'm gonna make exceptions
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.400]   'cause I think this is exceptional circumstance,
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.800]   and I've been dating this guy,
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.640]   and he cheated on his girlfriend with me,
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.480]   and we started dating,
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.080]   but he wouldn't cheat on me like that
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.000]   because we are totally different.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Or you're the guy, maybe you're dating a girl,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.480]   and people are like, dude,
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.560]   have you looked at her Instagram?
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.840]   Like, every other picture is her putting her cleavage out
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.520]   in the shortest dress that you could ever see,
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.440]   and this doesn't seem like she's a girl
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.320]   who wants to be known for godly qualities,
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.920]   and you're like, yeah, you know,
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.800]   but she dresses that way,
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.440]   but it's 'cause she's a cheerleader, dude.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.040]   You have to in order to get the job.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.680]   Let me just say this.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.720]   If any relationship that you're in
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.080]   includes you saying something like, yes,
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.960]   but you should get your butt out of that relationship.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.640]   (congregation laughing)
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.760]   I couldn't be more serious.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.760]   There's not a more significant human relationship
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.720]   that you're gonna have than your marriage,
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.320]   or your wife, or your husband,
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.680]   and you thinking, man, I'm gonna make an exception here
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.160]   'cause they seem to be pretty exceptional.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.000]   Here's what I know.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.600]   You are not gonna be the exception to the rule.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.840]   You will be a statistic,
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.400]   and you're gonna lose at love in 10 ways.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.280]   The Bible says that the qualities
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.640]   that you should look for in a person
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.880]   are character, someone who fears the Lord.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.720]   Proverbs chapter 31, verse 30 says, charm is deceptive.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.960]   Like, hey, man, they just seem like they got charisma.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.360]   Like, being around them, there's a connection.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:05.360]   Beauty is fleeting, but a woman or a man who fears the Lord,
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.240]   that means they know God.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.840]   They walk with him.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.960]   They live in light of knowing and walking with God.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.320]   They are worthy to be praised.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.680]   Honor them for all that their hands have done,
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.880]   and let their works bring praise at the city gate
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.520]   or like in the community.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.560]   Proverbs 14, verse one says, the wise woman builds her house.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.600]   Or you could have the wise man, like someone who's wise.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.660]   This is who you should look for.
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.600]   The wise man, wise woman builds their house, builds it up.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:40.560]   But with her own hands, the foolish one tears it down.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.680]   Solomon says, two types of people in the world.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.080]   You got people who are wise, know God, walk with him.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.320]   They're gonna be someone that if you let into your life,
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.620]   you marry that person, you're gonna have a house one day,
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.040]   a family one day, that's all built up.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.200]   Then there's the homewrecker.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   They're a fool.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.200]   They don't know God.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.420]   They don't walk with him.
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.320]   He literally says, wrecks their home.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.740]   Says, you need to decide what are you gonna look for?
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.000]   And if you're making exceptions
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.600]   'cause you think they're exceptional,
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.480]   you're gonna end up with a homewrecker.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.760]   And you're not gonna win at love,
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.000]   you're gonna lose at love in the second one.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.360]   Third idea, play married.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.840]   What do I mean by play married?
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.680]   This means we live together, we sleep together,
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.960]   we've moved in, we think the next step in our relationship
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.540]   is moving in and kind of exploring like,
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.180]   is this something that could long-term work out?
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.140]   Let me just first say,
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.280]   I get why this is such an appealing thing.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.980]   Like rent is expensive,
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.660]   you're spending a lot of time together.
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.220]   Some of you are listening right now and you're like,
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.380]   yeah, but I'm spending the night over there a lot anyways.
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.620]   I got a lot of my stuff over there.
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.860]   We might as well move in, save on rent.
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.380]   My roommates all moved out.
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.500]   I mean, where am I supposed to go?
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.140]   Where do you want me to live?
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:50.960]   It just makes sense.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.900]   And we're ready to take the next step in our relationship.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.780]   We need to see, I even have parents telling me,
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.040]   some of you may say, hey, hey, before you get engaged,
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.720]   you guys should probably like live together a little bit
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.180]   and see if this is something that you're really sure
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.880]   you wanna move forward in.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.960]   Why would that be a bad idea?
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.280]   The Bible says in Hebrews chapter 11,
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.600]   sorry, Hebrews chapter 13, verse four,
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.280]   marriage should be honored by all.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.000]   And the marriage bed or having sex
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.700]   should be kept pure just for marriage.
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.180]   God will judge the adulterer in the sexually immoral.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.100]   If you're living together, having sex together,
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.900]   giving your heart away, you're not honoring marriage.
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.180]   You're not preparing yourself for marriage.
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.320]   And you are setting yourself up to lose
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.160]   in the third way at love.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.620]   Why do I say you're not preparing yourself for marriage?
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.100]   Like here's what living together is,
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.060]   in case you think this is like,
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.700]   this will prepare us for marriage.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.620]   When you live together and you're in a dating relationship,
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.980]   you're basically going like,
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.620]   it's more of a combination of your college roommate
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.720]   and a sex partner than it is a marriage.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.560]   It's true.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.560]   It's like, oh, dude, we sleep together,
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.600]   we kinda pay half the bills, I'll pay half the bills
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.640]   and we can have sex.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.200]   You're not walking through what it looks like
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.240]   to walk through infertility.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.960]   You're not getting up in the middle of the night with kids.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.760]   You're not like saving up for retirement income
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.000]   and having to work through conflict.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.880]   It's not preparing you for marriage.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.800]   Statistically, living together,
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.840]   and I know this is gonna wreck a lot of people's worlds
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.220]   or anger a lot of people,
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.100]   is increasing the likelihood of you getting a divorce.
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.720]   And there's studies that have come out and been like,
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.920]   oh man, that's not exactly clear.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.960]   The most recent studies that have come out have said
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.200]   it increases your likelihood of getting a divorce
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.400]   if you live together before marriage.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.760]   And here's why.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.280]   Because sociologists, 'cause people are beginning to study,
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.260]   like how could that be?
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.240]   That's so counterintuitive.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.340]   Non-Christians going, it's so interesting.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.680]   You live together before marriage,
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.760]   that's gotta be the next step.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.560]   How could that not increase the likelihood
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.400]   of you succeeding?
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.080]   Like how could it have the inverse effect
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.140]   and make it likely that you're gonna end up breaking up?
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.280]   And sociologists have termed,
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.500]   one of the leading reasons why they think
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.700]   is because whenever you begin to live together,
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.740]   you kind of slide into marriage
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.820]   versus deciding to get married.
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.740]   Let me explain it like this.
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.700]   Like you end up getting a house, you're there,
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.380]   we're like, we're moving in, we're splitting rent,
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.580]   and you begin to make decisions that kind of yoke
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.940]   and intertwine your life together
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.220]   that make it harder to decide,
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.020]   I don't think this should keep going forward.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.460]   You get a phone bill and you're like,
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.520]   man, this is too high.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.740]   Let's share our phone plan.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.720]   You get a phone plan together
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.760]   and now you're living together,
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.600]   you're sharing your AT&T phone plan.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.500]   Then you're like, you know what?
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.780]   I saw these puppies at the park.
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:21.620]   I think we should get a dog.
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.260]   You bring home a dog named Princess,
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.260]   it's a little bulldog.
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.420]   And then you got this, you're like, we're parents together.
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.940]   And all of a sudden, your life gets closer
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.560]   and closer and closer.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.260]   You co-sign on a car that you're gonna lease
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.100]   and step by step, without even realizing it,
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.460]   you're like, I've just put so much
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.220]   relational equity into this.
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.420]   And I see some red flags.
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.400]   I'm not exactly sure they're the right person,
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.740]   but it just feels like we're already pot committed.
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.820]   Might as well get married.
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.740]   And rather than going, hey, I can clearly think through this,
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.260]   they have the qualities that I see in a person,
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.340]   they're a godly person,
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.620]   I will make the decision to get married.
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.420]   You just kind of slide into marriage.
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.320]   And they're saying that is why there's likelier,
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.940]   or likely, the explanation for the greater divorce increase.
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.300]   What do I mean by that?
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.980]   There's certain things in life it's okay to slide into
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.540]   and it's not gonna be that expensive or costly in the end.
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.300]   Things like a subscription.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.840]   This happens all the time, or at least happens to me.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.900]   Like Disney Plus, when that came out,
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.460]   any Disney Plus people in the room?
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.380]   Four of you guys.
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.900]   When you have kids, that's your jam, man.
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.420]   And we signed up in November, got Disney Plus,
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.860]   it was like seven day trial,
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:28.840]   and then they always get you
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.100]   'cause you put your information in
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.960]   and then seven days goes by and you forget,
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.280]   oh yeah, I signed up for that thing.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.700]   And I just kind of slid in without even realizing it
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.900]   and now I've got a subscription,
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.660]   still need to go in there and cancel.
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.040]   But at the end of the day,
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.840]   me sliding versus kind of deciding,
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.620]   honey, we're gonna get the Disney thing,
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.400]   is not that costly.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.240]   It's seven bucks a month.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.560]   You sliding into marriage is incredibly costly.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.660]   And the story that you're gonna have,
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.220]   the story you're gonna tell your kids,
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.200]   story that you're gonna live with,
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.320]   you are writing right now,
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.320]   and if it includes you living together and playing marriage,
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.020]   you are living disobedient to the scripture,
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.380]   you are increasing the likelihood of you getting a divorce,
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.220]   and I know you're going,
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.340]   hey, not us, that won't be our story.
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.900]   And there may be some story out there that you're like,
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.100]   hey, my family did it, or my parents did it,
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.400]   and it was okay with them.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.140]   Being an exception to the rule
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.340]   doesn't mean that your parents' marriage was thriving
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.000]   and experiencing everything God intended
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.260]   marriage to experience.
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:34.340]   The fourth way you can ruin love in 10 ways this decade
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.420]   is search for the best.
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.500]   Search for the best,
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.700]   this really applies to, I guess, everybody,
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.180]   but people that are in significant relationships.
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.060]   What does this look like?
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.740]   Today, we live in a day and age
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:47.140]   where I can search for the best on virtually anything.
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.580]   Like, if I wanna go have the best seafood in town,
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.400]   what do I do?
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.540]   I pull out my phone, I go to Yelp,
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.000]   type in best seafood around,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.160]   then I find the top 10 list, go to that one,
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.220]   highest reviews.
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.500]   I'm not going to a three star, go to a five star.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.400]   Go to that five star, sit down at the restaurant,
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.260]   then what can I do?
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.900]   I can find out what the best food
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.060]   at that best restaurant is.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.140]   So I pull in tips, and I'm looking up
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.740]   all the different things that I can eat.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.500]   We live in a time where it's never been easier
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.280]   to kind of have awareness of what options are out there
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.300]   and selecting the best.
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.020]   Amazon, used to be a day and age
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.500]   where if I wanted a microwave,
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.500]   I'd go to Sears, be like,
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.380]   "Hey, which one of these will last,
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.520]   "you know, hopefully beyond a year?"
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.700]   Today, I pull up Amazon, and I just go highest rated,
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.860]   and I pick it out there.
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.740]   Search for the best.
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.440]   I'm not settling, I'm an American.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.680]   Let's do this.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.960]   That translates,
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.260]   and can transfer over into the way
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.140]   that a lot of us think about dating without realizing it.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.140]   So we begin to think like, "Dude, hey, you know,
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.500]   "I'm dating her, she's fine.
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.340]   "There's something about her
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.420]   "that kind of annoys me a little bit,
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.420]   "and you know, she's blonde, I really like brunettes."
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.640]   And I begin to go, "Maybe there's somebody out there
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.740]   "that's better out there,
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.060]   "so I'm gonna go find this person."
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:51.760]   And I begin to search, going,
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.600]   "I'm looking for someone
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.820]   "who's the most compatible person out there."
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.060]   And as we've said before,
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.460]   the reason that's a bad idea is one,
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.020]   you'll never accomplish it.
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:02.840]   If you're looking for like
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.020]   the single most compatible person on the planet,
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.720]   you probably won't find them.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.200]   Statistically, they're in China.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.600]   They got a billion people over there,
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.700]   so their odds are not in your favor there.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:16.260]   And beyond that, there's always gonna be something
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.500]   that is gonna be wrong with them,
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.580]   just like there's always something wrong with you.
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.840]   So searching for the best is a bad idea.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.880]   Searching for someone who has the best qualities,
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.640]   according to God, is the best hope and option that you have.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.460]   Searching for the best is a bad idea,
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.080]   and searching for someone who has the best qualities
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.240]   that are the qualities that God says is best
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.200]   is your best option.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.820]   In Proverbs 31, verse 10, it says,
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.160]   "A spouse with noble character, who can find,"
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.960]   like, dude, that is rare.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.840]   "They are more valuable than rubies or than wealth."
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.440]   They are of tremendous wealth.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.440]   If you find them, you hold onto someone who has character.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.340]   I remember sitting down, and I remember dating my wife,
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.780]   and I remember being in a place where I was like,
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.620]   "Man, I just don't know.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:02.880]   "Like, is this the person?"
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.880]   And I had a close friend that was, like, in a community,
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.720]   godly guy, who was like, "Hey, look, so you're wondering,
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.700]   "are they the most compatible?
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.320]   "Let me answer, no.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.160]   "There probably is somebody out there who's more compatible
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.240]   "in whatever way today in this season
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.600]   "you define compatibility.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.080]   "They may like, you know, the Astros,
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.340]   "you know, close to the way that you do,
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.260]   "or long suffer with the Aggies in a way that, you know,
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.640]   "you do," and that joke didn't make sense
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.920]   to anybody in here but the Aggies,
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.120]   but you got me, people.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.220]   Or that has whatever qualifications today
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.440]   as you define compatibility.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.200]   So yes, that person is out there.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.320]   That's a terrible question.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.360]   You need to ask, does this woman have the qualities
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.520]   and characteristics that I want to spend my life with,
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.840]   characteristics that God says is best?
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.880]   And if you're out there and you're dating,
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.800]   and you're like, "Man, are we the most compatible?"
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.320]   That is a bad question.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.120]   A better question is, does this person have the character
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.160]   of someone that I wanna marry,
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.440]   that I want my children to be like,
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.040]   that I want my children to be raised by?
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:09.040]   The fourth, fifth way you can lose at love this decade
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.140]   is jump from relationship to relationship.
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.240]   This one is hard because if you're this person,
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.600]   you don't think you're this person.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.840]   But you're the person in the room
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.720]   who's always talking to somebody.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.040]   You're on dating apps, probably right now,
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.780]   and you are always in a relationship with someone.
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.760]   You never have time where you're single,
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.200]   and if you are single, it kinda drives you nuts
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.480]   'cause you're like, "Man, I'm just trying to get back
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.080]   "into a relationship."
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.640]   And there's probably something,
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.240]   haven't done this a while, really unhealthy
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.060]   that you're feeding through those relationships
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.240]   a codependency.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.680]   A lot of times, it comes out of a need
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.720]   that I just need affirmation or attention from girls,
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.520]   or I just need a guy to tell me that I'm pretty.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.160]   There's some type of discontentment and insecurity
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.200]   that is in your life.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.080]   And if you're jumping from one relationship to the next,
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.280]   you're never healing,
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.880]   and you're probably gonna miss out,
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.240]   because you're not healing,
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.200]   on becoming the type of person,
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.080]   type of godly guy or godly girl who has the character
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:13.000]   that a godly guy or godly girl is gonna be looking for.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.400]   The scriptures say that contentment is a mark
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.220]   that through a relationship with Christ,
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.460]   we as believers know, I'm not defined
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:25.880]   by having a dating status on my Facebook.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.160]   I'm not defined by having a relationship.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.240]   I don't need somebody to define me.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.200]   I know my identity is secure in Christ, and I'm content.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.880]   Paul in Philippians chapter four,
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:39.000]   verse 12 and 13 said, "I have learned the secret
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.500]   "of being content, whether I'm single,
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.100]   "whether I'm married, whether I'm employed,
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.440]   "whatever the circumstance, in every situation,
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.520]   "whether I'm living in plenty or in want,
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.180]   "I can do all of this through Christ,
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:58.000]   "who gives me strength."
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.520]   One of the qualities and characteristics of a godly spouse,
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.720]   if you're looking for someone,
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.800]   you should ask the question,
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.680]   are they jumping from one relationship to the next,
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.440]   the next, the next?
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.640]   Like, did we start talking
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.920]   when they were still dating somebody?
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.560]   If so, you should be concerned.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:18.040]   All right, number six, focus on chemistry over character.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.160]   Focus on chemistry over character.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.900]   Chemistry is like the nicest way
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.560]   that I could put a combination of like electricity
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.840]   and they got good curves,
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.840]   and you kinda like, you know,
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.480]   just some of their personality,
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.040]   and when you're around, it's like electricity's
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.800]   moving back and forth between the two of you,
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.080]   and there's just something there.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.980]   And we focus on that over character.
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.280]   You are focusing on a thing
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.680]   that will not be a part of your relationship always,
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.480]   and will change with different seasons in your life.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.380]   Why do I say that?
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.320]   Chemistry really is, it's kinda,
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.620]   whether that means like, hey man, sex is really good,
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:56.240]   or just like, you know,
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.340]   there's butterflies constantly when I'm around her,
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.520]   will not be something that lasts
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.780]   and is strong enough to make a relationship last.
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.440]   In other words, that won't always be there,
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.700]   and hopefully you guys know that, but think about that.
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:08.680]   If that's the reason where you're like,
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.600]   yes, every time we're together,
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.840]   it's just like such good vibes,
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.840]   I just feel the energy, that's not gonna be there.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.720]   Like, think about in dating relationships,
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.240]   if you've ever dated somebody and you've broken up,
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.100]   you've seen that, yeah, chemistry can come and go.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.440]   Like, there's somebody that when you first,
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.660]   you're like at the movie theater,
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:25.920]   moving your hand towards each other,
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.640]   just touching pinkies, and you're like,
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.740]   and it's overwhelming.
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.640]   (congregation laughing)
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.680]   And you date a little bit, and then all of a sudden,
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.160]   you're like, I don't wanna be in a relationship
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.140]   with this woman, and you don't feel anything towards them.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.360]   You're like, dude, I don't care,
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.220]   I feel nothing other than like, just bitterness, probably.
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:46.160]   That chemistry came and it went.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.720]   And say, well, that happens in marriage,
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.960]   there's seasons, there's times
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.520]   where you're going through life,
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.900]   and it won't always be there,
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.820]   but what will be there is character.
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:01.240]   In Proverbs chapter 12, verse four,
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.320]   Solomon warns young men,
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:09.160]   a wife of noble character is her husband's crown,
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.840]   but a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.680]   That's Solomon's nice way of saying,
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.520]   if you have a wife that doesn't have character,
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.440]   it's gonna be like you're dying on the inside
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.760]   for the rest of your marriage.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.980]   If you have a husband that doesn't have character,
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.240]   it's gonna be like a slow death from the inside
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.600]   for the rest of your marriage.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.160]   We've said before, it is so much better
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.120]   to be lonely and single today
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.180]   than lonely and married tomorrow.
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.040]   And there, thank you, preach.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.080]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.520]   If I do say so myself.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:47.320]   There are a lot of people who get married,
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.280]   and they're experiencing an even deeper loneliness
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.080]   in that marriage, 'cause there's no hope of,
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.560]   man, maybe someday this'll be fixed.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.560]   And you can lose love and lose at love
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.600]   if you focus on chemistry over character.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:09.360]   Number seven, project past hurts.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:15.440]   And this one is huge if you are in a dating relationship.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.560]   You gotta work through past hurts.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.840]   Past hurts, whether they be from family or friends
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.600]   or past dating relationships,
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.440]   because if you don't practice forgiveness,
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.280]   you're not ready to get married.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.440]   Like marriage is one long I forgive you
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.820]   after I forgive you after I forgive you.
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:36.960]   And it's all towards someone who deeply hurts you,
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.840]   who you deeply love.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.480]   And if you can't forgive,
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.840]   whatever things are in a part of your story today
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:46.040]   or in your past, you're not ready to move past that.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.200]   So you gotta deal with that baggage,
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.360]   or else that baggage is gonna come back up again,
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.760]   like some of us in the room, we carry around stuff,
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.160]   and you've basically, understandably,
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.040]   you were wronged and you were really hurt.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:27:59.880]   And you haven't dealt with that
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.720]   and you haven't forgiven that person.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.480]   And when you carry that,
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.720]   it's like you carry a bag of bitterness around with you.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.600]   And the more that you have a bag of bitterness around,
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.240]   it makes it easier to pick up other things
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.640]   and put it in there.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.600]   Like some of us have walked through life,
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.520]   and the things that you're holding onto
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.320]   represent past relationships.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.080]   Like a guy cheated on you your sophomore year of college,
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.200]   and you don't trust people anymore.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.760]   And that's why you're always around,
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.880]   or the girl cheated on you,
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.920]   and so every time you're dating,
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.080]   you're like, I need to see your phone,
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.000]   I need to see it right now,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.640]   I wanna know exactly why I saw you
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.600]   talking to Sandra over there.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.920]   And you're like, well, Sandra's my cousin.
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.160]   And you've gotta deal with it.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.360]   Others, maybe some of the hurts,
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.000]   and again, I get it, man, they're all understandable.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.840]   They come from just family or parent or father wounds,
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.000]   or a mom who wasn't around,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.320]   or maybe a dad who never said that they loved you.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.760]   And you've gotta carry that scar,
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.840]   and it manifests itself in different ways,
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.280]   but you've never dealt with it.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.560]   You've never forgiven your parents.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.800]   And before you take the next step,
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:11.800]   you need to forgive family, siblings, parents.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.160]   I mean, forgive, like, I forgive you,
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.200]   you never came to my sport games.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.040]   I forgive you that you were never around.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:25.080]   I forgive you that you were angry all the time.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:29.120]   And I'm choosing 'cause God in Christ has forgiven me,
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.840]   and the scriptures command me, I have to extend forgiveness.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.080]   And I forgive you, like I was forgiven.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:41.000]   Others, it may just be related to trust issues in general,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.080]   or broken trust from friends, like, just,
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.880]   that betrayed you, that lied about you,
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.960]   that left you out, that hurt you.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.960]   Whatever those hurts are, walking through and walking through,
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.200]   I'm gonna choose to forgive.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.440]   I don't wanna carry around the bag,
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.760]   because if I carry that bag around,
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.800]   I'm gonna bring it into marriage, and I'm gonna,
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.360]   I promise you, you're gonna put things in that bag.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:06.920]   Maybe the hardest one is gonna be working through abuse.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:11.600]   Statistically, one in four people in this room
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.960]   were abused in some way, and it wasn't your fault,
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.960]   and it wasn't right,
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.840]   and forgiving them doesn't make it right.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.320]   But you're gonna carry that into marriage,
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.400]   and it's gonna impact your love life, and your sex life,
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.240]   and your marriage life, and all that.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.080]   And you know what, that's not fair, it's not.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.520]   But it's also true.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.360]   And the best gift you can give your spouse today
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.480]   is beginning, I'm gonna work through some of the baggage.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.760]   I don't wanna carry this anymore.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.000]   I don't wanna bring this into my marriage,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   'cause I know, if I'm holding onto stuff now,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.760]   you're gonna hold onto stuff later.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:49.280]   Colossians chapter three, verse 13,
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.840]   is one of tons of verses that says,
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.200]   forgive one another if any of you
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.320]   has a grievance against someone.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.520]   Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:09.240]   The eighth way you can lose at love
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.560]   is that you can isolate your relationship.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:17.120]   If you are the only person in your life,
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.560]   other than the person you're dating,
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.560]   who is celebrating, and excited about,
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.040]   and knows about your dating relationship,
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.520]   you should be concerned.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.080]   If you're the couple, we all have seen this couple,
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.080]   that they come together, and they start dating,
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.360]   and it's just like they submarine.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.320]   They disappear, and they'll resurface at some point,
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.680]   and you haven't seen them in forever.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.400]   They just become the couple that they only hang out
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.880]   with one another, they're constantly around each other.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.760]   And it's not a bad thing to like being with each other,
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:40.800]   and like being around each other,
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.680]   but if no one else in your life knows the relationship,
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.200]   is celebrating the relationship,
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.040]   if there's no godly counsel in your life,
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.800]   or community that is celebrating,
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.000]   saying, hey, this is a good thing.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.080]   Yeah, I see you guys working well together.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.560]   I think this is a great relationship.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.660]   I celebrate that.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.120]   You should be concerned at best.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.360]   Proverbs chapter 18, verse one says,
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.880]   whoever isolates their relationship,
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.040]   seeks their own desire, or isolates themself.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.060]   They seek their own desires,
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.860]   they break out against all sound judgment,
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.820]   or all like rational wisdom.
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.100]   They kind of lash out against that,
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.140]   'cause they're like, I'm gonna do what I want to do.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.720]   If you are isolating your relationship,
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.920]   you should be concerned.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:32.740]   Ninth way, have sex when you're ready.
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.760]   Have sex when you're ready.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.360]   This feels like the nicest way for culture to say,
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:42.000]   just don't be a hussy,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.700]   but have sex whenever you think it's best.
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.040]   Because, I mean, what does that even mean?
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.160]   I feel like I was born ready.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.480]   Or like, by 12 years old, I was like,
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.120]   yeah, I feel like I'm ready, all right.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.840]   The answer all of us would give across the room
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.920]   would be entirely different.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.960]   What does that even mean?
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.980]   Hey, have sex whenever you're ready.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.760]   That's a terrible standard.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.600]   And yet, if you turn on and listen to any pop culture today,
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:06.600]   the most throttled version of sexuality is like,
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.520]   hey, I'm just waiting, Colton from The Bachelor,
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:12.960]   I'm waiting 'til I find that right person, then I'm in.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.220]   That's a terrible idea.
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.760]   Biblically, it's a terrible idea,
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.920]   because the scriptures say that at a soul level,
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.480]   every time you have sex with someone,
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.000]   you are touching that person,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.860]   and they are touching and impacting you
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.820]   at the deepest part of your heart,
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:29.640]   unlike any other sin in your life.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.480]   First Corinthians chapter six, verse 18 says,
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.160]   "Flee all sex outside of marriage.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:42.700]   "All other sins a person commits are outside the body,
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:46.560]   "but whoever sins sexually sins against their own body.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.820]   "Do you not know that your bodies are temples
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.100]   "of the Holy Spirit who's in you,
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.180]   "whom you have received from God?
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.960]   "You're not your own, you were bought with a price.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.040]   "Therefore, honor God with your body."
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:03.000]   Biblically, God is not anti-sex, he's so pro-sex,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.680]   and dude, when you get married, here's what I'm confident.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.340]   Married people have way more sex than you guys
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.840]   if you're single, it's true.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:12.240]   God's not opposed to sex, he wants you to experience that,
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.480]   and because he's so pro-sex, he wants it to be
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.840]   in the confines of a marriage that is safe and secure,
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.720]   where you don't have to put out
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.280]   in order for somebody to stay,
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:24.520]   but where you lovingly give yourself to one another
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:30.240]   in the context of an unbreakable bond and covenant.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.960]   Having sex when you're ready is a terrible idea,
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.880]   having sex within marriage is a great one,
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.440]   but if you wanna lose at love, you should have sex.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:42.880]   The last one, believe that love
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.300]   is something that you fall into.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.960]   We talk about love in a funny way, you know?
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.300]   We're like, man, then I just fell in love,
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.760]   as though it's like a puddle or something
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.320]   you kind of drifted into.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.880]   This unstoppable force that kind of came out of nowhere
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.060]   and there I was and I was just doing my life, running along,
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.800]   and then I saw her and whoa, we spent time together
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.940]   and now all my hobbies have changed
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.520]   and the hills are alive with the sound of music
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.220]   and just fell in.
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.600]   The reason that's a really bad idea
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.520]   is because if you believe love is something
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.200]   you can fall into, you also believe love
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.420]   is something you can fall out of.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.200]   The reason the divorce rate is as high as it is
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.480]   is because our culture believes,
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.320]   like man, I just fell out of love.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.920]   As though love is something you can fall into
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.800]   and you can fall out of.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.360]   Biblically, love is not something
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.340]   that you fall in or fall out of.
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.240]   It is something you live out.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:41.060]   And you particularly live it out in the context of marriage.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.820]   It involves acting.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:45.200]   Like we have our timeline off.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.680]   The timeline that most people have is like,
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.080]   hey, we dated, we fell in love, then we got married.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.280]   A better timeline is that, hey, we dated,
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.120]   we saw this as something that,
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.760]   we were both on the same page, character, the qualities,
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.480]   I saw all the things God said, this is the right move,
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.360]   others around us celebrated that relationship,
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.160]   we got engaged, we got married,
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.720]   and you know what happens then?
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.160]   Then the loving begins.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.600]   Because love is something that takes sacrifice,
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.480]   that takes work, takes all types
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.240]   of descriptive terms biblically.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.800]   The best passage, or most extensive passage on love,
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.360]   you've probably heard at a bunch of weddings,
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.320]   is this, from 1 Corinthians chapter 13, verse four.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.880]   Love is patient.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.720]   Think about these things.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.700]   You don't fall into patience, you choose to be patient.
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.240]   Love is kind, kindness.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:36.740]   It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.980]   It does not dishonor others.
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:43.220]   It is not self-seeking.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.380]   It is not easily angered.
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.380]   It does not keep any record of wrongs.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.380]   That means love chooses, I forgive you,
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.140]   I'm not holding this against you.
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.620]   That is entirely action.
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.980]   That's what that means.
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.300]   There's been a wrong, and I'm choosing,
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.440]   despite the fact that I was wronged,
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.780]   I'm not holding onto that.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:05.540]   It's not some emotional-led decision,
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.940]   that is, I'm deciding to do that.
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:08.860]   It's what love is.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:12.640]   It's something that you live out, not that you fall in.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.380]   Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.800]   Love always protects.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:22.100]   Love always trusts, it always hopes, or believes the best.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:25.700]   It always perseveres, love never fails.
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.420]   All of these, biblically, love,
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:32.460]   biblically, involves these attitudes and actions
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:36.300]   in your life, not this emotional overflowing and feeling.
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.020]   The idea of first comes love, then comes marriage,
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:43.020]   then comes baby carriage, is, hey, we date,
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.920]   we got married, then love begins,
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.740]   because it's in that context that I have to choose.
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:50.580]   I'm gonna die to myself and put your needs before my own.
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:51.820]   And my wife dies to herself and says,
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.780]   I'm putting the needs of the other person before my own.
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.740]   You can't even fully live out love until you're married.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:00.740]   We get the progression off.
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.820]   Once you get married, that's when the love begins
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:07.200]   and deciding, I'm choosing to die to myself to love you.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.060]   Biblically, that's what love is.
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.720]   It's not some emotional, overflowing experience.
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.660]   The apostle Paul, you know how he ends this passage?
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.180]   It's really fascinating.
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.940]   Second, about love, and then out of left field,
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:20.580]   he begins to talk about his childhood,
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.460]   where you're like, love is this and love is this,
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:25.740]   and he's like, when I was a boy, and here's what he says.
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.740]   When I was a child, I talked like a child,
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.760]   thought like a child, I reasoned like a child.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.580]   When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me.
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:38.300]   In other words, in the context of love,
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.060]   it's almost as though Paul is saying,
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.340]   hey, there's a lot of myths people believe about love.
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.860]   Like, they believe in the fairy tale,
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.700]   got Cupid over there firing arrows.
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.700]   There's a lot of crazy stuff people believe,
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.740]   but when I became a man, I put those away,
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:51.940]   and I began to accept the truth,
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.380]   and I put childish things behind me.
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:57.300]   Love is the decision that I make to die to self
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:01.860]   in the context of marriage over and over and over and over.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.260]   It's not always easy, doesn't always come easy,
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:08.020]   but that is what marriage is,
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.540]   and I know that I'm ready for marriage when I decide,
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:14.140]   man, I'm ready to love through the actions
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.500]   that Scripture calls me to.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:19.420]   Here's the summary one more time.
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.940]   If you wanna lose at love in 10 ways,
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:25.460]   date for fun, make exceptions, 'cause they're exceptional,
[00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:29.260]   play like you're married, search for the best,
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.780]   jump from relationship to relationship,
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.980]   focus on chemistry over character,
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:37.340]   don't deal with past hurts, isolate your relationship,
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.660]   and have sex when you're ready,
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:43.380]   and believe love is something that you fall into.
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.220]   We close here.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:48.700]   Maybe the biggest lie, or one of the biggest two lies,
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.140]   or just kind of two directions, maybe we'll take it,
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:55.540]   is some of you are believing you can reject
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.780]   and do as many of those as you want and not lose at love,
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.060]   and you have bought a lie,
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:05.060]   and someday you're gonna wake up,
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.280]   and you're gonna go, how did I get here?
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.740]   The love story I hoped I would experience
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.700]   is not the love story that's getting written around me,
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:15.140]   and I feel like I may even be past kind of the stage
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.820]   of even when I would fall into that love story.
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:21.720]   Others of you, you're in the room,
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.860]   and you believe that, man,
[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.140]   because you've broken one of these,
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:25.860]   you're too far, and you're too damaged goods,
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.740]   and the love story God has for you can't be something
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:32.020]   where if you will turn and surrender life
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:35.380]   and your love story to Him, He'll write one out of that,
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.220]   more beautiful than anything that you could have imagined,
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.880]   and you think you're too damaged of goods,
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.580]   and the God who's there doesn't look at it like that.
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.640]   The choice is yours and mine.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.360]   Am I gonna decide to follow His way or not?
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.320]   It's like this.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.080]   My wife and I have been recently looking for,
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.480]   like on a mattress search.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.080]   We've had the same one for years,
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.000]   and we have, you know, came across the bed-in-a-box thing,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.320]   found mattresses that they'll ship right to your door.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.520]   Really interesting, and we've gone through four of 'em.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.360]   We went through the Purple, through the Lisa,
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.360]   Casper, Helix, and here's the deal.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.320]   You get 'em, you're gonna sleep on 'em,
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.820]   and you get a 100-night trial, totally free.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.200]   Like if you don't want it, no questions asked, return.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:17.260]   365-day trial on one of 'em, no questions asked, return.
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.700]   And we went through it, and we kind of were sleeping
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.060]   on these different mattresses,
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.540]   and each time the same thing happens.
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:22.440]   Really interesting.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.220]   We call, and it's like, man, this one's too hot,
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:26.940]   and this one's too cold, and this, you know,
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.580]   porridge, three little bears.
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:31.780]   But we call, and we're like, I wanna return this.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.740]   And they've said the same thing each time.
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.580]   They're like, okay, great.
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.980]   Well, if you just donate it to a charity of your choice
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.740]   and send us a receipt, that's fine.
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:43.660]   In other words, they're like, because you used it,
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:45.680]   that thing is so worthless to us now
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.300]   that we won't even come get it.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.960]   So just get rid of it, and do whatever you want with it,
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.240]   and that's it.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.100]   We don't even care to come and get it back.
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.260]   You've been sleeping on it.
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:58.000]   It's used, it's not worth it.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.140]   In so many ways, that's such a reflection
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:03.760]   of like the dating culture that we live in.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.320]   In our world, that wants you to have
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.220]   that romantic love story at the same time
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.860]   also chastises you and makes you feel like damaged goods
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.600]   if a part of your story didn't always work out
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.440]   the right way.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.620]   You got an STD, you had an abortion in your past,
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.420]   you had sexual dysfunction in your past,
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.400]   maybe there was sexual abuse,
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.520]   and you can feel like damaged goods that, hey,
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:24.180]   everyone around me feels like, reiterates,
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.320]   I'm used, I'm worthless, I'm abused.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.080]   And the message of the Bible is that despite any of these
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.080]   being broken in your past, your story doesn't have
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:34.840]   to be over, and that a godly guy or a godly girl
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.440]   is not exempt from you no matter,
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.800]   listen very closely to me, no matter your story,
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.720]   it does not have to be the case that, hey,
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.160]   a godly guy would never have interest in you,
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.720]   or a godly girl would never have interest in you.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:49.560]   If you believe that, you have bought a lie,
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.280]   because the New Testament really tells us
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.960]   that anyone who's a godly guy is gonna act like Christ.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.400]   How did Christ act towards people
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.500]   who had sexual dysfunction in their past?
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.000]   We're actually told.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.640]   He looked at a woman who had sexual dysfunction
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.600]   taking place in her present.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.200]   He's teaching one morning, he's at the temple,
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.120]   in John chapter eight, he's sitting there
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.320]   and he's teaching, and they bring this woman
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.440]   who'd been caught in the act of adultery,
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.880]   caught in the midst of having sex with not her husband,
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.680]   with some other man, and they drag her,
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.600]   and they throw her in the middle of Jesus's message
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.720]   right in front of everybody.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.020]   How does the Son of God respond to a woman
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:32.020]   clearly guilty of sexual sin, dysfunctional relationship?
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.700]   How does God respond?
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:39.540]   We're told that he looks at the men,
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:44.120]   and the men yell out, the law says
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.360]   we should condemn her to death.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.840]   They call for the death penalty.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.820]   How do you respond, Jesus?
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:56.360]   Jesus kneels down on the ground.
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.620]   He begins to write something in the dirt.
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.280]   We're not even told what he wrote.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:06.420]   Draws with his finger, and then he stands up,
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:13.540]   and he says, let him without sin throw the first stone.
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:17.820]   And then he kneels back down
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.460]   and starts writing on the ground.
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.420]   What?
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:25.380]   Jesus, she's an adulteress.
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.300]   She's ruining a family's life.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.420]   She's caught in the middle of having sex with somebody else,
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.940]   and you're perfect, holy God, you look at her
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.140]   despite the law calling for the death penalty,
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.860]   and you say, hey, if you're without sin, you can do it.
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:38.700]   You know the answer.
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:39.780]   You know they have sin in their life.
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:40.880]   They can't do that.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:45.520]   And he kneels back down, and he gets writing in the dirt.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:49.340]   And we're told that the oldest to the youngest,
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:53.020]   they walk away, and now it's just Jesus and the woman.
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.380]   He's kneeled on the ground.
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.620]   And he looks up, and you gotta think
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.220]   this woman's covered in tears and who else,
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.300]   who knows what else?
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:04.780]   And he looks her in the eyes, and he says,
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.080]   does no one condemn you?
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:11.740]   And she responds, no one.
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:18.260]   And Jesus says, go and leave your life of sin.
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:22.900]   I don't condemn, and I don't condone,
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.620]   but I'm gonna be crucified on a cross for sin like this,
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:30.760]   and there is no sin that makes you so unwanted by me.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.540]   You're not used and damaged and abused goods,
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:36.140]   and a godly guy and a godly girl
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.900]   will see you with the eyes of Jesus,
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.980]   and I so desperately want you to hear me.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:45.020]   Your story is not done, but you have a part in that story
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.460]   of saying, God, I surrender.
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.060]   I want a love story that you write.
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.060]   I give you the pen, write it all over my life.
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.860]   Take it, use it, I'll date however you want me to date.
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.620]   I don't wanna write a story like my parents' story.
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:57.620]   I don't wanna write a story
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:00.140]   like so much of Hollywood's dysfunctional crap.
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:03.660]   I want a love story that lasts, God.
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:06.580]   And everywhere I look, the best shot I got in culture
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.420]   is a coin flip.
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:11.260]   So if that's possible, God, I surrender, take it.
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:17.100]   And a godly guy, if you turn, and a godly girl,
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:18.700]   if you say, God, I wanna walk with you,
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.660]   I'm gonna walk with you, I'm gonna date like you call me to,
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.020]   he's gonna look at you like Jesus looks at you.
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:29.280]   Forgiven, new, whole.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:33.460]   But you have to make the decision what you're gonna do.
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:35.660]   Are you gonna keep driving your own life?
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.780]   'Cause if so, you're never gonna heal,
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:40.580]   and you're never gonna have that godly guy around,
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.460]   and you're gonna buy the lie that you're damaged goods,
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:46.220]   so you just gotta settle for damaged Daniel.
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:51.980]   You don't have to, sorry, Daniel.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:55.440]   You gotta decide.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:00.940]   Are you gonna have a decade that roars
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:01.940]   as it relates to your love life,
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.580]   or are you gonna lose love in every way
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:07.740]   when it doesn't have to be so?
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:08.580]   Let me pray.
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:14.660]   Father, thank you that you don't condemn
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:16.300]   sexually immoral people like me.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:20.700]   You don't condone those with sexual brokenness
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.420]   in our past and sexual sin, sexual relationships.
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:27.180]   And yet also, you don't condemn
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:31.300]   because you were crucified taking
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:33.460]   all the condemnation on you.
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.060]   I pray that tonight, anyone in this room
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:37.620]   who has bought that lie, and there are many,
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:42.620]   that they're too far gone, their story is too far
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:47.740]   to be woven back and made new, redeemed.
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:50.900]   Your spirit would overwhelm them now
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:54.700]   and help them reject that lie.
[00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:58.020]   I pray for anyone who's never trusted
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.420]   and what you did on the cross,
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:02.880]   perfect expression of love,
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:07.060]   that they wouldn't lose that love
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:09.220]   by not accepting it tonight.
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.500]   And I pray for dating relationships.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.580]   God, protect those of us who are dating in the room.
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:17.020]   Protect us from living in our own ways,
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.820]   dating as we see fit or the world says to.
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:21.060]   Stop marriages from happening.
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:24.260]   Break couples up right now that need to.
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.380]   Form marriages that need to.
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:27.460]   We love you.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:28.900]   We worship you in song, amen.
