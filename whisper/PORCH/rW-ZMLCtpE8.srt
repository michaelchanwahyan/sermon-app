1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,160
 How are we doing?

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,680
 It's great to be back with you.

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,120
 What's up Fort Worth?

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,460
 Shout out Houston.

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,680
 Everybody driving down the road, listening to the message, live streaming at home.

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,040
 We're glad you're tuned in.

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:42,440
 The preface of tonight is that we find identity throughout our lives in different things.

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,520
 And so in college, I was identified as a partier.

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,520
 Okay.

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,520
 I didn't know Christ.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,520
 I didn't walk with Jesus.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,340
 I loved to party, love to go out.

13
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,120
 And so there was a part of that is it's who I was, or at least who I thought I was.

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,560
 And so I went to school at this small college in Waco.

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,520
 And if we really wanted to party in Waco, we would come to Dallas.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,040
 And so my boys and I, we drove up to Dallas and we were going to go to this club in Deep

17
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,040
 Ellum.

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,520
 And the problem was, is they were all over 21 and I was not.

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,520
 Okay.

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,400
 But that's okay because we had a plan.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,480
 So what was going to happen is my roommate was going to get in and then pass back his

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
 ID.

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
 Okay.

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,960
 Don't try this at home.

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,380
 I know you wouldn't, again, not walking with Jesus, not a Christian at this time.

26
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,040
 And so we're waiting in this line, in this club here in Dallas and Deep Ellum.

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,800
 And he gets through and I'm watching the bouncer.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,480
 Like he's not even looking at IDs.

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,820
 I'm like, this is going to be easy.

30
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,400
 And I'm kind of banking on the fact that he's not going to look at the ID.

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,280
 And so he gets in, works like a charm.

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,720
 There's six people between us.

33
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,680
 We did that strategically, pass back the ID.

34
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:10,400
 I get up there, I hand it to him and he starts looking at it real close.

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,920
 And he says, this isn't you.

36
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,440
 And I'm just kind of like, I'm trying to intimidate him a little bit.

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,780
 And he says, "Babak Ali Hadid."

38
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:39,880
 To which I say, "It is me."

39
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,480
 Like I'm thinking, I'm playing the race card a little bit.

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,880
 I'm like, no, don't, you can't hold me down, bro.

41
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
 Don't, you know?

42
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,640
 I'm like, I'm going to get in this.

43
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,600
 And then I had accounted for that.

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,040
 I had had that conversation in my head, but then he said something I didn't think about

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
 very well.

46
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:04,960
 He says, "It says you're five nine."

47
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:11,560
 So just in case we don't know each other, like this is five nine.

48
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,440
 So I'm thinking fast.

49
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,160
 I said, it's a typo.

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,320
 I'm five 19.

51
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
 I didn't say that.

52
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,280
 I didn't really say that.

53
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,080
 Long story short, I didn't get in there.

54
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,760
 And if you think about what I was trying to do is I was trying to use a fake ID to get

55
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
 in.

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,420
 But what I think is a greater tragedy is most of us, right?

57
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,700
 We will go through lives embracing fake IDs.

58
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,120
 We will think we are someone who we're not.

59
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,120
 That's what I was trying to do.

60
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,320
 I was pretending to be someone who I wasn't.

61
00:03:52,320 --> 00:04:00,720
 And right now, some of you came in this evening and you are finding identity in someone or

62
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,000
 some things that you're not.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,440
 And I hope this evening, as we wrap up this series called Amnesia, about forgetting who

64
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,760
 you are, forgetting your identity, I hope we have a greater understanding of who God

65
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:26,040
 truly made us to be and what really matters and who we really are.

66
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:34,080
 Because if you go through this life and you begin to find identity in the wrong things,

67
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,520
 you get to the end of this life and you realize that you embraced all the things that don't

68
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,040
 matter.

69
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:51,160
 And there's this wake up call that you potentially wasted every second the Lord entrusted to

70
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,880
 you, believing that you are someone who you aren't.

71
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:06,960
 And so let me explain with a thoughtful question for you, maybe the most important question.

72
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,920
 Some would say the most important question.

73
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,520
 Who are you?

74
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,720
 How do you answer that?

75
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
 Who are you?

76
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
 What goes through your mind?

77
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,880
 You know, first you say a name.

78
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,360
 Well, the name's not who you are.

79
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
 It's a sound.

80
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,760
 It's something your parents came up with so that you would know you were talking to them.

81
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,040
 It's certainly not who you are.

82
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,200
 You say, well, my hometown is where I'm from.

83
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
 Well, that's where you're from.

84
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,400
 It's not who you are.

85
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
 That's a geographic location.

86
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,960
 Okay, well, my family name.

87
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,360
 Okay, you're telling me about other people now who are related to you, still not who

88
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
 you are.

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
 Okay, my job.

90
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,920
 Well, that's interesting trivia question, but that's not who you are.

91
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,160
 My hobby is still not who you are.

92
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
 Good to know.

93
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
 Who are you?

94
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,320
 And maybe right now you're like, oh, JP, I know that I'm a child of God.

95
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,160
 Don't Jesus juke me.

96
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,080
 That's not what you go through life thinking, hey, this is who I really am.

97
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,960
 All the decisions that we make in life, we're essentially accessorizing a character based

98
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,360
 on who we think they are.

99
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,240
 The car we drive, the bag we carry, the clothes we wear, where we work, where we live, our

100
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,240
 apartment, whatever, our neighborhood, our friends.

101
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,920
 We're accessorizing a character of who we think we are, but it's not who you are.

102
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,720
 The apostle Paul is going to tell us this evening who you are and to do so he's going

103
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,400
 to look at fake identities, fake IDs for your consideration.

104
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,720
 We're going to be in Philippians chapter three.

105
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,400
 So if you turn to the New Testament there towards the second half of the Bible and you

106
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,160
 move through the gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and then you move through Acts and Romans,

107
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,040
 Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, chapter three is where we'll be.

108
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
 Really the whole chapter.

109
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,360
 I'm going to fly by not teaching so much verse by verse, more thematically through this chapter

110
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:04,000
 as we look at fake IDs that the apostle Paul identifies who we are.

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 And really kind of the points up front is the reality that you're not your accomplishments,

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,160
 you're not your mistakes, and you're not your desires.

113
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,000
 You're so much more than those things.

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,680
 To set this up, Philippi is a part of the Roman Empire, an important part of the Roman

115
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,920
 Empire because there was a civil war that took place there, a battle that took place

116
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,760
 in this city in 42 BC.

117
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,040
 And because of that battle, what happened as a result of the battle is the Roman Emperor

118
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,280
 granted the Philippians the opportunity to be Roman citizens.

119
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,840
 Now you think, what's the big part about that?

120
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,120
 Well, as you think about the Roman Empire, the 70 million people that encompassed the

121
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,120
 Roman Empire, only 9% of them were Roman citizens.

122
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,960
 And so this town, the people of this town, the Philippians, they found identity in their

123
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,640
 citizenship of Rome.

124
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,200
 Not just that, but then you take this religious group, the Way, known as Christians, Christ

125
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,880
 followers, and there's these Judaizers coming in.

126
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,040
 What that means is there's these people, this religious group that is saying, "Hey, you

127
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,920
 need to be identified by the good works that you do.

128
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,080
 Not just the good works, but the way you treat your body, the way you dress, and things that

129
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,960
 you do to yourself.

130
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,920
 That's really how you get good with God."

131
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,180
 That is also a fake ID.

132
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:28,660
 So citizenship and what you do, these are two fake IDs that Paul is addressing as he

133
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,180
 writes this chapter 3, verse 4.

134
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:39,460
 If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more.

135
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,460
 Almost sounds arrogant.

136
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,780
 But then he goes through his resume.

137
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,260
 He says, "Circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin,

138
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:53,060
 a Hebrew of Hebrews, in regard to the law of Pharisee, as for zeal, persecuting the

139
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,060
 church, as for righteousness based on the law, faultless."

140
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,180
 Let me put that in modern language for you because we read that and we're like, "What

141
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,180
 does that mean?"

142
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,900
 He's saying, "Hey, you want to talk about my family?

143
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,300
 I was born to the right parents.

144
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,940
 They got connections everywhere.

145
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,540
 You want to talk about my education?

146
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,060
 Ivy League with honors.

147
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,380
 You want to talk about power?

148
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,620
 I have authority over my enemies.

149
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,100
 I can persecute them.

150
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,500
 You want to talk about religion?

151
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,940
 I never missed a day of church.

152
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,700
 I've memorized more Bible than you've forgotten.

153
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,020
 You want to talk about respect?

154
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,180
 Other guys, older guys, call me for advice.

155
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,700
 You want to talk about money, stuff, status?

156
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,460
 I win.

157
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,380
 What do you want to measure success on?

158
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,420
 I'm better than you."

159
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,460
 That's what he's saying.

160
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:46,020
 But then he says this, "But whatever were gains to me, I now consider loss for the sake

161
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,020
 of Christ.

162
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:56,820
 What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing

163
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,340
 Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things.

164
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,460
 I consider them garbage."

165
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,980
 In the Greek scruple of the word there, it's almost a curse word like crap.

166
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,100
 He's saying, "I consider it trash."

167
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,100
 It's slang.

168
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:25,700
 "I consider it excrement in comparison to knowing Christ."

169
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,700
 The first fake ID that we're looking at is your accomplishments.

170
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,980
 The apostle Paul is not identified by his accomplishments or his resume.

171
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,700
 He's saying, "Hey, I know that I'm better than you by any measuring tool that you can

172
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,540
 come up with, but I no longer point to what I've accomplished.

173
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,700
 I point to what Christ accomplished for me."

174
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,540
 He makes this really big effort to explain this so that you would find identity not in

175
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,900
 what he's done, but in what was done on his behalf.

176
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,260
 This is so important.

177
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:06,660
 I think it's the hardest lesson for us to learn outside of the incomprehensible grace

178
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,900
 that God gives us.

179
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,780
 He's saying, "Let me lay out some fake IDs for you guys.

180
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,620
 What you make, it's not who you are.

181
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,580
 Where you work, it's not who you are.

182
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,180
 Who you date, that's not who you are.

183
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,500
 Who your family is.

184
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:36,100
 Do you find pride or bow up or say, 'Hey, this is my ...' Your ethnicity, that's not

185
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,940
 who you are.

186
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,660
 How many followers you have.

187
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:46,100
 Are these things that you think about more than you think about your identity in Jesus?

188
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,340
 That's not who you are.

189
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,860
 Where you live, the neighborhood, what apartment you live in, where you bought a house, the

190
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:57,060
 fact that you were able to buy a house, this is not who you are," he's saying.

191
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,060
 He's telling us this.

192
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,620
 "This is not what is ultimately important.

193
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,860
 It's not bad things.

194
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,860
 It's just not who you are."

195
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:10,340
 He says, "All the things that you think are worth working for, they're crap to me."

196
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,900
 I use that word because he did.

197
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,620
 They won't matter in 100 years.

198
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:25,720
 He says ... Actually, let me explain it like this.

199
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,660
 It's very philosophical and difficult, and I don't want you to get stuck early in the

200
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,940
 message thinking about this in a loop, but I will say this up front.

201
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:39,140
 I think the most honest answer to who you are is who you will be permanently.

202
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,420
 If you think about that, because nobody came in here saying, "Hey, this is who I am," pointing

203
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,860
 to who you were, pointing to old accomplishments.

204
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,680
 We just don't do that.

205
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,020
 We feel sorry for people who do that.

206
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:56,380
 Some of you were the prom queen, but none of you came in wearing a tiara, saying, "That's

207
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,320
 right, guys.

208
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,740
 That's who I am."

209
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:05,160
 You wouldn't do that, even though one day in the past it was really, really important

210
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
 to you.

211
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,660
 Probably, and I'm so sorry if you did, nobody came in wearing a letter jacket.

212
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,340
 It's cold outside, so I'm going to bundle up in this guy, and plus, the patches attract

213
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,460
 the ladies.

214
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,060
 Nobody did that.

215
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,380
 But once upon a time, you would have been like, "Yeah, this is who I am.

216
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,380
 See that?

217
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,380
 That's what I'm talking about.

218
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,380
 That's what I'm talking about."

219
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,380
 Power lifting.

220
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,380
 What?

221
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:37,660
 That's what you would have done.

222
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,820
 Right now, Paul's saying, "Hey, we don't find identity in our past accomplishments."

223
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,860
 He's saying, "Indeed, you don't even need to find identity in your present accomplishments.

224
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,180
 Consider where you will be.

225
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,420
 Consider what is going to be forever and ever and ever."

226
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,740
 Like at the sum of your life, at the end of it, people aren't going to talk about things

227
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,900
 that you did when you were little or things they didn't see or once upon a time what happened.

228
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,420
 They're going to talk about the sum of your life.

229
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,980
 They're going to talk about what they knew of you for the longest part of your life and

230
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,020
 the last part of your life.

231
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,980
 But he's saying, "Hey, there's something past this life."

232
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,980
 He's going to begin to tell us this.

233
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,140
 This is the context of this, right?

234
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:20,580
 We're not living in the past.

235
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:26,380
 And so I want you to consider what accomplishment is most important to you right now.

236
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,500
 And can you have the maturity to say right now, "Outside of knowing Jesus, it really

237
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,780
 doesn't matter.

238
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,780
 I have that perspective.

239
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,980
 It really doesn't matter."

240
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,380
 He says, "I consider them garbage that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having

241
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,700
 a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in

242
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,300
 Christ, the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith."

243
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,500
 So now he's saying, "Hey, it's not my righteousness.

244
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,300
 It's Christ's righteousness, and I want to know Christ."

245
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:03,620
 "Yes," he says, "to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings,

246
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,420
 becoming like him in his death, and so somehow attaining the resurrection from the dead."

247
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,900
 Paul is saying something really key that is true for you too.

248
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,980
 He's saying, "The greatest thing about me is not something I've done, but something someone

249
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,700
 I know did."

250
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,660
 He says, "Let me point to one really amazing accomplishment."

251
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,300
 Like, what is the most amazing thing that anybody could accomplish?

252
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,220
 Like this thing that if you could do, we would just be like, "Well, you win.

253
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,020
 It's better than any promotion, any trophy, any jacket, any crown."

254
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,740
 Like if you can do that, that's the greatest accomplishment bar none.

255
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,460
 Let's go with A, living forever.

256
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,180
 Eternal life.

257
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,060
 Like you're dead, you come back to life, and you live forever.

258
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,060
 He says, "Hey, you stack my accomplishments next to that.

259
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,100
 I got nothing.

260
00:15:53,100 --> 00:16:01,780
 Why am I going to point to what I've done when I can point to what he's done?"

261
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:06,900
 My first point this evening is this.

262
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:12,540
 You are identified by Christ's accomplishment, not your accomplishments.

263
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,700
 Paul's not going to stack his accomplishments next to Christ's.

264
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,580
 He's going to say, "Hey, I haven't missed Sunday school at all," when he has over here

265
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,580
 perfection.

266
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,940
 You are identified by Christ's accomplishment, not your accomplishments.

267
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,580
 There's something else key that's happening in this text.

268
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,420
 This is why he doesn't find identity in the wrongs he's done.

269
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,620
 Because remember, this guy's done some wrongs.

270
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,340
 He's done some terrible things, worse things than you've done, he's done.

271
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,180
 That's why he writes in verse 12, "Not that I have already attained all this, or have

272
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,980
 already arrived at my goal."

273
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,180
 No, the goal's still ahead of me.

274
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:46,620
 "But I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.

275
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:52,140
 Brothers and sisters, porch goers, young adults, I do not consider myself yet to have taken

276
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,140
 hold of it.

277
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:59,100
 But one thing I do, forgetting," listen, "forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is

278
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,100
 ahead.

279
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,900
 I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in

280
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,900
 Christ Jesus."

281
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,340
 He says, "I'm not looking back, I'm looking forward.

282
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,100
 It's not where I've been, but where I'm going that's important."

283
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,740
 And so the fake identity that he addresses here is being identified by your past.

284
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,260
 Things that have happened to you, things that you participated in, sins that mark you.

285
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,500
 He says, "Hey, this is not who I am."

286
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,980
 Some of you cannot see Christ's forgiveness past your wrongdoings.

287
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,300
 When you look at the cross, all you do is see the wrong you've done.

288
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,940
 You don't see God's grace and his forgiveness.

289
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,260
 The grace that he freely extends you in spite of you.

290
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,380
 And Paul is not identified by his past.

291
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,420
 He's not sitting here in this letter like, "Guys, I just got to tell you, remember when

292
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,220
 Stephen died and they stoned him and I was there and I took joy in that and then I locked

293
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,420
 up women and children and it says that I persecuted them in the scriptures.

294
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,980
 It said I persecuted them to death.

295
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,980
 I killed them.

296
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,980
 I'm a murderer.

297
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,980
 Woe is me.

298
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,220
 I can't do ministry.

299
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,220
 I'm disqualified."

300
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,700
 He doesn't do that.

301
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,740
 And he doesn't even talk about abuse that he's endured.

302
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,420
 He doesn't say, "Man, when I went to Antioch, they beat me.

303
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,740
 These people turned on me.

304
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,580
 Guys I thought were my friends stoned me.

305
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,660
 They whipped me.

306
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,740
 You don't know what it was like.

307
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,740
 They whipped me.

308
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,740
 I can't do ministry."

309
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,740
 No, he doesn't do that.

310
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,780
 He said, "Yeah, man, terrible things happened to me.

311
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,860
 I did terrible things.

312
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,020
 I'm looking forward.

313
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,380
 I'm looking ahead to the prize.

314
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,780
 I'm looking where I'm going, not where I've been.

315
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:38,420
 I'm looking forward."

316
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:45,340
 When people tell me, this conversation I have all the time, "You going to heaven?"

317
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,340
 "Yeah, I don't know."

318
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,340
 "Why?"

319
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,500
 "I've just done some things."

320
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,180
 They think that's humble.

321
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,180
 It's not humble.

322
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,380
 It's really arrogant.

323
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,340
 If you think that something you've done wrong can keep you from heaven, then you think that

324
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,300
 there's a good you can do to get you in heaven.

325
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,780
 You're only going to get to heaven because of what Christ did for you.

326
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:14,740
 It has nothing to do with what you've done, only what you believed about Jesus.

327
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,420
 There is no sin, no sin, none whatsoever.

328
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,540
 The scripture says God delights in forgiving your sin.

329
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:28,840
 There's no sin that can disqualify you from heaven other than you rejecting Christ with

330
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:34,180
 your life.

331
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:41,580
 You're not good enough to get to heaven, and you're not bad enough for heaven to be kept

332
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,980
 from you.

333
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:49,940
 It's not about your good or bad works.

334
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,420
 Christ's radical forgiveness doesn't belittle your sin.

335
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,860
 It magnifies his grace.

336
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,540
 You hear that?

337
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,900
 His radical forgiveness doesn't make less of your sin.

338
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,460
 It just magnifies his amazing grace.

339
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,780
 When I was in college, clearly I liked to drink.

340
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,380
 I've already told you I liked to party.

341
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,580
 I was at this particular party.

342
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,440
 It was on Baylor's campus.

343
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,300
 The police came, and I got arrested for MIP.

344
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,660
 It stands for minor in possession.

345
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,740
 I was cuffed and taken to the back of a car to jail.

346
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,460
 I spent the night in jail.

347
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,300
 As hard as I thought I was, I was honestly scared.

348
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,500
 I stood before the judge the next day.

349
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,380
 There were all these consequences, fines, and things they were putting in front of me,

350
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,300
 but there was this one, these words that I didn't even know why to be afraid of these

351
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,500
 words, but they just seemed so terrifying.

352
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,580
 It's going to be on your record.

353
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,020
 I don't even know what that means.

354
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:59,420
 I don't even know where this record is kept and what it sounds like, but I don't want

355
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,820
 it to be on my record.

356
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,900
 It just feels like for the rest of my life I'm going to meet with someone, "Hey, I'm

357
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,300
 JP, and I've got to tell you I've got a minor in possession in college."

358
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,700
 Every job interview I go to is like, "Hey, how are you?

359
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,420
 No, I think I'm really competent and proficient in Microsoft Word, and yes, minor in possession."

360
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,860
 That's just going to follow me.

361
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,700
 I remember having a conversation with my parents, and everybody being like, "Hey, we've got

362
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,420
 to make sure this doesn't stay on your record."

363
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,980
 Not that we had a lot of money, but I remember my dad talking to an attorney and just thinking

364
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,460
 through, "Hey, what can we do to make sure this doesn't stay on my record?"

365
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:42,620
 I remember even bargaining with the judge and me losing my license in exchange so that

366
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,940
 this doesn't stay on my record.

367
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,220
 I remember celebrating the reality that it's not on my record.

368
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,220
 It's not on my record.

369
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,460
 It got off my record.

370
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,540
 It wasn't that I didn't get an MIP.

371
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,020
 It's just that now the MIP doesn't mark me.

372
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,860
 It's not like it never, ever happened.

373
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,340
 Now it just doesn't follow me.

374
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,500
 Is that not the beauty of the gospel, that Jesus comes to you and says, "Hey, it's not

375
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,180
 on your record"?

376
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,340
 Abortion?

377
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,340
 Not on your record.

378
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,340
 Pornography?

379
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,340
 Not on your record.

380
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,340
 Drunk driving?

381
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,340
 Not on your record.

382
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,340
 DWI?

383
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,280
 Not on your record.

384
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,660
 How beautiful is this that he comes to you?

385
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,380
 It's not like you say, "I never drove drunk."

386
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,380
 It's not denial.

387
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,740
 It's like, "Hey, I did, and he forgave me.

388
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,060
 It ain't who I am.

389
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,980
 It's not on my record, man.

390
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,980
 It's not on my record.

391
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,420
 It's not who I am."

392
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,420
 That's what Jesus does.

393
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,660
 He comes, and he says, "Hey, man, that's not on your record."

394
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,060
 Why?

395
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,060
 Why is it not who you are?

396
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,060
 Because it's not who you are in eternity.

397
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,060
 God, you don't get up there and go, "Hey, man, listen.

398
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,060
 Come here.

399
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
 Let's talk about this MIP.

400
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:44,060
 No, let's talk it before we let you in.

401
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,060
 That's cool.

402
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,580
 Christ, cross, all that.

403
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,580
 Preaching.

404
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,580
 Okay, cool.

405
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,980
 Minor in possession."

406
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:57,580
 It's funny, because it ain't going to happen, because I've been forgiven.

407
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,820
 It's not on my record.

408
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,820
 You're identified by Christ's payment, not your past.

409
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:12,420
 My second point, you're identified by Christ's payment, not your past.

410
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,700
 It's not that the MIP wasn't a big deal.

411
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:24,140
 It's that the fact that it wasn't on my record was a bigger deal.

412
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,500
 You're identified by Christ's payment, not your past.

413
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,460
 Paul's talking about looking toward the prize, and he says this, verse 15, "All of us then

414
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,540
 who are mature should take such a view of things."

415
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,540
 What does he mean here?

416
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,540
 He's talking about maturity.

417
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,540
 Could you imagine talking to a high school student?

418
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,540
 He's like, "Hey, did you make the team?"

419
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,580
 He's like, "No, it doesn't matter, though.

420
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,300
 It's not going to matter 10 years from now."

421
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,100
 "Hey, did you get the letter jacket?"

422
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,780
 "Nah, I didn't.

423
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,780
 It's okay.

424
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,780
 It's not going to matter 10 years from now."

425
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,220
 You would say, "Wow, that's a really mature view."

426
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,540
 We are that student right now.

427
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,380
 That's happening right now.

428
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,500
 There's things right now that you're like, "They're so important."

429
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,900
 He's like, "No, no, they're not important.

430
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:11,580
 A hundred years from now, they won't be important, so they're not important."

431
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:18,060
 If on some point you think differently, verse 15, that too God will make clear to you.

432
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:22,100
 Only let us live up to what we have already attained.

433
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,780
 We're not focused on the punishment from the past because Christ has forgiven that, and

434
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,860
 God who stands outside of time sees the finished product in us, the product that he finishes

435
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:37,020
 himself, our glorified state, our sinless state presented to him white as snow, pure

436
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,440
 as Jesus.

437
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,700
 He sees that standing outside of time, and so why don't we live up to what he has already

438
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,780
 freely given us?

439
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:51,020
 If I'm running a race and I've already given the prize, they say, "Hey, here's the prize.

440
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,460
 You win, but I just need you to run the race."

441
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,780
 I'm running the race, and I fall.

442
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,820
 I don't stay down.

443
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,940
 I get up, and I finish the race.

444
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
 I keep running.

445
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,940
 Why?

446
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,020
 Because I'm a runner, not a faller.

447
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:09,120
 In Christianity, as we walk this walk, we don't stumble, trip, fall, look at something

448
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,520
 I shouldn't have, did something I shouldn't have, and then just stay down.

449
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,920
 No, man, I did it.

450
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,300
 Dust myself off, get up, and I'm running because I'm a runner.

451
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,920
 That's what I do in a race, and the prize is already promised to me, so why am I going

452
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,920
 to stay down defeated?

453
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,420
 Keep going.

454
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,600
 Live up to the prize you've already won, verse 17.

455
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,960
 Standing together and following my example, he says, "Brothers and sisters, and just as

456
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:42,160
 you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do.

457
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:47,180
 For as I have often told you before and now tell you again, even with tears in my eyes,"

458
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,180
 think about what's happening right here.

459
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:55,800
 He's writing this letter in Rome, and he's writing to these people that he loves in Philippi.

460
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:01,400
 As he thinks about where he's about to go, he just starts weeping, so much so that he

461
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,200
 tells them, "I'm weeping.

462
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,520
 Even with tears in my eyes," you've got to hear this, guys.

463
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,960
 "Many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.

464
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,400
 Their destiny is destruction."

465
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,320
 Simply means they're going to hell.

466
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,040
 Their God is their stomach.

467
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,500
 Here's what that means.

468
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,560
 It means they worship by feeding their appetite.

469
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,720
 They do whatever they want to do.

470
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,080
 Have you ever met someone who does whatever they want to do?

471
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,560
 They're dysfunctional.

472
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
 It's not good.

473
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:43,200
 That is the freedom that many of us came into the room wanting.

474
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,680
 We want to do whatever we want to do.

475
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,880
 We want that level of freedom, yet we know consciously it makes people dysfunctional.

476
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,400
 No one has ever done well with that.

477
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,720
 Their God is their stomach.

478
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,040
 They follow their appetite.

479
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,600
 They feed their desires.

480
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,440
 They feed their preferences.

481
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,220
 Their glory is in their shame.

482
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,160
 They take pride in the locker room, conversate.

483
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,720
 "Man, you won't guess what I did, guess who I did, guess what happened, guess what I want.

484
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,160
 Oh, did you see that?"

485
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,920
 Their glory is in their shame.

486
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,000
 They're not just sinning.

487
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,720
 They're proud of their sin.

488
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:33,320
 And then it says this, consider where this is to, their mind is set on earthly things.

489
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:40,280
 So in this list of these people whose destiny is destruction, he punctuates it with their

490
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:45,800
 mind is set on this world.

491
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,240
 They want to be a really big deal in this world.

492
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,960
 They're not thinking about the next world.

493
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,800
 And so this fake ID is your earthly desires.

494
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,400
 You being identified by your desire, "Man, I love food.

495
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
 I love food.

496
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,760
 I love shopping.

497
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,840
 I'm a leg guy."

498
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,320
 You being identified by your desires.

499
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:17,460
 I kind of picture myself as a gossip girl or a Gilmore girl or a sex in the city girl.

500
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:24,480
 And we begin to think that our, not me, but maybe one of you, we think our desires define

501
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
 us.

502
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:31,040
 And Paul is urging you not to be identified by your earthly desires.

503
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,720
 So we got to hear this.

504
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:41,680
 Some of you, some folks you know, and even folks in the church, your glory is in your

505
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,680
 shame.

506
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,280
 You call what is evil good and what is good evil.

507
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:54,460
 You made this exchange and you don't even realize that your conscience is so seared

508
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:01,520
 and you begin to find identity in your sexual identity or your number of partners or how

509
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,760
 much weed you smoked or how big of bar tab you've had or how drunk you've been.

510
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,140
 "Man, remember that time we got so wasted that I threw up."

511
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,660
 A fight you got in.

512
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,660
 How you profited on someone's misfortune.

513
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,660
 "Boy, you wouldn't believe how I got the money.

514
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,660
 It was great.

515
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,660
 He was so stupid."

516
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,060
 And your glory is in your shame.

517
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:27,260
 And you don't even see, you are celebrating the things Christ died for.

518
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,060
 The very things that held him to the cross.

519
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,540
 You're entertained by them.

520
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,540
 You're watching.

521
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:35,540
 I can't wait to see that movie so that I can be entertained by the things that killed my

522
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,420
 God on a cross.

523
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,020
 You're out there, you're dancing to a song.

524
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,500
 You don't even realize it's about sex trafficking, pimps and hoes and whatever.

525
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,300
 And you're dancing to the beat, it's so great.

526
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,660
 Glory is in your shame.

527
00:29:50,660 --> 00:30:03,020
 You're so lost in the world that your eternal citizenship has been lost in your life and

528
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,540
 you don't even see it.

529
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,580
 You don't even know it.

530
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:25,300
 You are entertained by the things Christ died for.

531
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:31,420
 And there's no place for you in eternity.

532
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:36,340
 Unless you repent.

533
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,140
 And you turn to Christ.

534
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,380
 You say, "Take my life.

535
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,820
 I'm tired of my glory being in my shame, my destiny being in my destruction.

536
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:51,020
 I'm tired of feeding my preferences and seeking to do whatever I want to do when I want to

537
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,020
 do it.

538
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,900
 I want to learn the discipline of yielding to your Holy Spirit.

539
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,380
 Would you give me your spirit, God?

540
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,540
 And instruct my heart, God, so that at 2am in the morning when I can't sleep, I don't

541
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:10,820
 return to the only coping mechanism that I've ever known, I stand strong, God.

542
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,140
 I don't just feed my appetite.

543
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:17,100
 I don't just call him because I miss him when I know he's not good for me.

544
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,940
 I don't just go back like a dog to his vomit to the same bar scene, the same club scene,

545
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,520
 the same dead relationship, the same sin struggles that I've had that I thought would always

546
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,700
 mark me.

547
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,700
 I'm done.

548
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,700
 I'm done.

549
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,700
 I'm done.

550
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,180
 I turn to you, Jesus, and I believe you're enough.

551
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,020
 I believe your death and resurrection is enough.

552
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,540
 I'm not so arrogant to think that my sins will hold me back from you.

553
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:50,140
 I'm not so arrogant to think that your spirit is not strong enough to heal me from this.

554
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:55,420
 I'm not so arrogant to think that I can't tell anybody about my struggles.

555
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,020
 I'm going to step into the light and I'm going to turn to you, Lord, and I want you to take

556
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,020
 over my life.

557
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,220
 I know you are playing games tonight.

558
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,380
 I don't want you to go into this Christmas season playing games.

559
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,060
 I want you to stop right now.

560
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:09,100
 I want you to turn to him and I want you to say, "Christ, I know you died for my sins

561
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,540
 and I know that death was enough.

562
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,100
 I know the resurrection is promised for me.

563
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,500
 It's a hope for eternity for me that I will be with you forever and ever and ever in your

564
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,500
 kingdom."

565
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,860
 All of these things that I've tried to fill my life with and find identity in out of my

566
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,140
 own insecurities, that this world is all that I have.

567
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,580
 I said I believed in heaven, but I lived like this world was all I had.

568
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,660
 I was a functioning atheist.

569
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,860
 I was an atheist.

570
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:38,860
 I rejected you with my actions and now I turn to you with my life.

571
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,780
 Some of you have got to do that tonight.

572
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,860
 I don't need a notch in my belt.

573
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:48,780
 I don't get a raise if you do, but I don't want you to go through life playing games

574
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,780
 like I did.

575
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:53,100
 If you had asked me in college, I would have said, "I'm a Christian.

576
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:58,900
 Nothing in my life looked like I was following Jesus.

577
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,740
 Nothing.

578
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:14,520
 Maybe that I would have showed up here on a Tuesday, but nothing else."

579
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,020
 If I could tell you what I did most of my life, I would define it like this.

580
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,100
 I would say I was looking at the wrong score.

581
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,540
 I wanted to be a millionaire before I was 30.

582
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,700
 Moved to this city, began to find identity in the things of this city.

583
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:34,140
 I landed in this sales job, started making money, flipped a house, had a chunk of money,

584
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:40,940
 bought a Jaguar, bought a penthouse condo in uptown, lived near a bar called T.A.B.C.

585
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:47,380
 that I frequented.

586
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,180
 Had the watches, had the suits.

587
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,620
 I had built a fake identity.

588
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,980
 I was looking at the wrong score.

589
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,220
 There was a game the other day that you would never know about except something interesting

590
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,220
 happened.

591
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,420
 It was Brown University Bears.

592
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,580
 They were playing the Bryant University Bulldogs.

593
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,980
 The Bulldogs freshman guard got the ball with 3.8 seconds left.

594
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,980
 Anybody hear about this?

595
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:15,900
 He got the ball with 3.8 seconds left, and he dribbled out the clock, which means he

596
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,900
 ran the clock down.

597
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:23,260
 His score was 91-90, and when the buzzer went off, he throws the ball up in victory, but

598
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:29,980
 the other team begins to celebrate because he was looking at the wrong score.

599
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,900
 He lost the game because he was looking at the wrong score.

600
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,700
 Can you imagine some of us getting to the locker room of heaven and saying, "Yeah!

601
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,700
 Did you see that?

602
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,060
 My resume?

603
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,500
 Did you see how hot she was?

604
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,660
 Did you see how hot I was?

605
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,700
 Did you see how disciplined I was?

606
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,260
 Did you see how often I went to church?

607
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,380
 Did you see this?

608
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,580
 Did you see that?

609
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,820
 Did you see that I was proficient in Microsoft Word?

610
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,820
 Did you see?"

611
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:04,500
 He's just like, "You were looking at the wrong score, bro.

612
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,220
 It's about Christ and you.

613
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,140
 You living for my kingdom, not that world.

614
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:18,980
 That's why he says, "But our citizenship is in heaven."

615
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,780
 Remember how they found identity in their citizenship to Rome?

616
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,500
 He says, "But our citizenship is in heaven.

617
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,660
 We don't belong to this world.

618
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,580
 In fact, we are eagerly awaiting.

619
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,780
 We are eagerly anticipating."

620
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,540
 Anybody anticipate Christ's return today?

621
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,100
 Anybody wake up this morning and say, "Jesus, I can't wait until you come back.

622
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:41,260
 I can't wait till you make this okay, till you do away with cancer, you wipe away the

623
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,260
 tears.

624
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,740
 There's no more heartache, no more breakups, no more hurts, no more diseases.

625
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,860
 Jesus, I can't wait for you to come back."

626
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:56,220
 We eagerly await a savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who by the power that enables

627
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,940
 him to bring everything under his control will transform our lowly bodies so that they

628
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,900
 will be like his glorious body.

629
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,860
 That's how this ends.

630
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,380
 What are you holding onto in that moment when your body is transformed to his glorious body?

631
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,380
 Who are you then?

632
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,700
 Am I six, seven then?

633
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,700
 I doubt it.

634
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,700
 Do I have blue eyes then?

635
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,700
 I doubt it.

636
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,700
 Brown hair?

637
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,700
 I doubt it.

638
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,700
 They didn't recognize Jesus in his glorified state.

639
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,700
 His friends did not recognize him.

640
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:26,380
 I bet you everything on my true driver's license today is not who I am in that moment.

641
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,580
 Is my name Jonathan?

642
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,540
 Doubt it.

643
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,740
 What matters then?

644
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:37,780
 Not just then in that moment, but then for the next billion years to the power of infinity.

645
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,540
 What matters then?

646
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,540
 Who are you then?

647
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,100
 That's who you are.

648
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,100
 Who are you then?

649
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,100
 I'm asking, who are you then?

650
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,100
 You think about that.

651
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,100
 Get your mind around.

652
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,500
 Was it who you dated, the breakup, the job, the promotion?

653
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,660
 Is that who you are then?

654
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,660
 Think about it.

655
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,660
 Who are you then?

656
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,820
 You're Christ.

657
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,660
 Forever and ever and ever.

658
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,940
 Are you that abortion?

659
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,940
 No.

660
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,940
 Pornographer then?

661
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,940
 The hooker in Vegas?

662
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,220
 No, no, that ain't who I am.

663
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,220
 Not then.

664
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,620
 Wiped away.

665
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,620
 Who are you then?

666
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,900
 Man, I'm good at sales.

667
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,900
 Not then.

668
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,900
 Nobody cares.

669
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,740
 I was so pretty.

670
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:19,860
 I had this many friends on Facebook, this many likes on Instagram.

671
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,100
 Who cares?

672
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,100
 What's Instagram?

673
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,580
 No Instagram up there?

674
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,580
 You see my story.

675
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,580
 Who cares your story?

676
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,220
 Did a sinner of Christ?

677
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,220
 Was it about Jesus?

678
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,220
 Who are you then?

679
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:45,340
 My final point, you are identified by your eternal destination, not your earthly desires.

680
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:51,660
 See, he's dealing with identity crisis here.

681
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,620
 My roommate, he was born in Iran.

682
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:58,180
 That's why his name reflects that.

683
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:04,020
 Despite my weak accent that sounded more Indian, he was born in Iran.

684
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,860
 I mean no offense by that.

685
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,620
 That's where he was born.

686
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:13,140
 If I went through life thinking that I was born in Iran, embracing his identity, that'd

687
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,100
 be an identity crisis.

688
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,180
 If you go through this life living for this world that you do not belong to, that's an

689
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,540
 identity crisis.

690
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,740
 What's crazy is the vast majority of us do.

691
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,240
 The vast majority of us have an identity crisis.

692
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,460
 Very few of you would come up here after this message and say, "JP, man, listen.

693
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,460
 I get it.

694
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,580
 I belong to heaven, man.

695
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,860
 There's nothing in this world that holds my heart.

696
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,860
 Nothing.

697
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,860
 Nothing.

698
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,860
 I don't need relationships.

699
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,980
 I don't need a status change.

700
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,980
 I don't need those things.

701
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,980
 I don't need the stuff.

702
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,980
 I don't need the promotion.

703
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,980
 I don't need that boss to like me.

704
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,980
 I don't need that boy to like me.

705
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,980
 I don't need that girl to like me.

706
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,980
 I don't need those friends.

707
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:59,280
 I need outside of knowing Christ, belonging to his body."

708
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,800
 Paul is not identified by his accomplishments, his past mistakes, or his earthly desires.

709
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
 He's not identified.

710
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:13,740
 You're not identified by what you've done because where Christ lives, it matters more

711
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,940
 than what you've done.

712
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:21,700
 You're not identified by what has happened in the past because it doesn't exist in eternal

713
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,700
 life.

714
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:27,340
 You're not identified by your earthly desires because they were an appetite for counterfeit

715
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:34,020
 gods and in eternity, your appetite will be fully satisfied by the one true, real, everlasting,

716
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:39,940
 eternal God whom you will be with forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.

717
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,620
 This is who you are.

718
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:52,620
 You are what you persevered in, what you are the longest, the sum of your existence.

719
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:57,720
 Who you are is who you are in eternity.

720
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,580
 Some of us tonight, and I mean tonight, we've got an identity crisis we've got to deal with

721
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,840
 tonight.

722
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,840
 You know it.

723
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,840
 Like right now, you know it.

724
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:10,980
 There's an identity crisis.

725
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:17,280
 I grew up in a church to a family that loved Jesus.

726
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,700
 Every Christmas after Thanksgiving, we'd set up the tree.

727
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:27,720
 I would really enjoy as a child getting out this nativity scene.

728
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,260
 It was always wrapped in newspaper.

729
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,840
 Mom would wrap it in newspaper and put it up.

730
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,780
 She would wrap up the figurines.

731
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,340
 I would unwrap them carefully.

732
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:41,980
 I'd set out the wise men and the shepherd and the sheep and the animals and the Mary

733
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:47,100
 and the Joseph and the baby Jesus and the barn-like stable thing.

734
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,620
 I'd arrange them and I'd make it look like it was this scene, like the wise men are walking

735
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:56,580
 up and the shepherd's there.

736
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,060
 I'd always just kind of take delight in that.

737
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:04,060
 There was something pure about that, something real about that, something Christmas about

738
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,700
 that.

739
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:14,540
 Then as the weeks would go by, people would come and visit us and they would bring presents.

740
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:20,820
 Presents would begin to surround the tree and to crowd out the nativity.

741
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:29,860
 On Christmas morning, I'd wake up and I'd come out of my room and I'd rush to the tree.

742
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:34,700
 Santa had come and there were presents everywhere.

743
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,580
 There was no sight of the nativity.

744
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:48,460
 It was drownded out by materialism cloaked in generosity and there was no sight of Jesus.

745
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,620
 This is a metaphor for me.

746
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:56,140
 It's become a metaphor for me at this time of year of what happens at Christmas.

747
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:02,180
 I believe that Christmas has an identity crisis.

748
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,860
 What I mean by that is you're going to leave here and something's going to happen in the

749
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,380
 next few days and the next few weeks.

750
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,020
 Your stress level's going to rise.

751
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,420
 The traffic's going to be crazy.

752
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,780
 The temperature's going to drop.

753
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,340
 You're going to begin that your mind's going to get to focus on your to-do list.

754
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,900
 You're going to work longer hours.

755
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,540
 You're going to feel the pressures of this world at this time where we're called to stop

756
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:36,380
 and to acknowledge God becoming a human being, not taking off his deity but putting on humanity

757
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:41,460
 for us to rescue us coming into our broken world to show us where our real citizenship

758
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,020
 belongs.

759
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:52,260
 You're going to forget the reason for the season as some say at this time.

760
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,740
 I share that with you, friends, for this.

761
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:04,140
 It's a microcosm example of the identity crisis of your life.

762
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:12,540
 What matters most in you today, tomorrow, and forever is what you've done with Jesus

763
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,540
 Christ.

764
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:20,100
 It's Christ living in you, the same Christ that embodied this baby in a stable where

765
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:27,460
 shepherds came to worship, born of a woman.

766
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,060
 This same Jesus lives inside of you if you've trusted him.

767
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:38,260
 His spirit is influencing your life, carrying you to eternity to be with him forever and

768
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,460
 ever and ever and ever.

769
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:45,260
 What you're going to leave here and do if you are not extremely careful is you're going

770
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:50,380
 to begin to fill your life with things that block him from the world.

771
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:56,780
 You're going to change the identities in front of him, stack presents and things and cars

772
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:03,460
 and jobs and bosses and relationships and work and promotion and bank accounts and sin

773
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:11,900
 struggles in front of him so that when people look at you, they don't see him.

774
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,780
 They see those things that you've tried to make yourself to being, the ways that you've

775
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,260
 accessorized your life.

776
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:23,100
 But in that moment when he comes to transform your earthly body into a glorified body, all

777
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:28,060
 that stuff's going to hit the floor.

778
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,220
 And what's going to matter then?

779
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,580
 Who are you going to be then?

780
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,100
 Who are you then?

781
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:41,020
 Because that's who you really are.

782
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:45,020
 What matters then?

783
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,580
 I pray that you'd renew your mind.

784
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:51,060
 I pray that as you leave here this message, you'd continue to trip over it every time

785
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:57,180
 you see a nativity, when you celebrate Christmas, that you'd stop the craziness of the world

786
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,180
 and say, "Not me.

787
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:02,500
 Man, I'm focusing on the baby in a manger.

788
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,500
 That's my God.

789
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,500
 That's my Savior.

790
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:12,060
 It's the one who matters most.

791
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:17,540
 I'm not going to get caught up in peppermint lattes and crazy lists.

792
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,540
 Jesus."

793
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:27,140
 And I pray that it would stretch beyond the season into your life.

794
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:31,100
 Father, would you do that?

795
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:41,180
 Just now as we turn to worship you, would you continue to grab our attention and focus

796
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:46,100
 our heart and mind on all that you've done for us, Lord?

797
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:50,140
 We're so grateful for the gift of your grace through Jesus Christ.

798
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:54,980
 We're so grateful for the incarnation that you came here as a man and lived a sinless

799
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:58,780
 life and died for our sins, and you rose from the dead.

800
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,660
 One of the craziest narratives, crazier than creativity could write.

801
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:11,060
 And Father, would you help us to trust in that, to believe that all our sins are paid

802
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,900
 for through that?

803
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,900
 It's not on our record.

804
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,540
 We love you, Lord.

805
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,540
 We praise you now.

806
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,540
 Amen.

807
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,540
 Amen.

808
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,540
 Man, it's been a long time.

809
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:28,540
 Amen.

810
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:31,740
 Man it's been an incredible year, guys.

811
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:35,860
 It's been silly what God has done in our midst.

812
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:43,040
 And I just can't lose this perspective that if he began to capture the hearts of young

813
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:50,140
 adults all over this city and all over this world, that we would come and we would give

814
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:54,340
 our lives to him and that he would prepare a place in this world for Christ to return

815
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,340
 back to.

816
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,340
 And I just can't wait for that.

817
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:03,940
 I'm so excited about that moment because all, every single thing I hate, and I use that

818
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:12,680
 word strategically, all that I hate is finished through that event.

819
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:17,100
 And it's incredible that we're going to this place where we're going to be forever.

820
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:21,860
 And anytime I've been, I'm going to a place that I don't know, like I haven't been to

821
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:22,860
 before.

822
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:27,380
 What I tend to do, like for example, over the Christmas break, we're taking the kids

823
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,020
 to Disneyland in California.

824
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,020
 We've never been.

825
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:33,940
 And so as soon as we decided that we were going to do that, I began to call people who've

826
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:34,940
 been to Disneyland.

827
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:39,560
 Like we're probably going to do this one time and I want to get the most out of the opportunity.

828
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,580
 And so I'm asking folks like, Hey, how do we get there?

829
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,580
 And where do we buy tickets?

830
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,660
 And what do we do when we get there?

831
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,900
 And how do I get the most out of that?

832
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,900
 I talked to people who've been there.

833
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:55,380
 Well, if we're going to go and be in heaven forever and ever and ever and ever and ever

834
00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:00,340
 and ever, and that's what is truly most important, then what should we do?

835
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:07,380
 Let's, let's look to the only one who's been there and came here to tell us how to get

836
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,380
 there.

837
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:12,500
 In fact, he's the way, the truth and the life.

838
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:18,620
 He's the door, the gate, the good shepherd, he's God.

839
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:21,540
 I'm asking you, I'm pleading with you.

840
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:25,260
 Give your life to him.

841
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,260
 If we can talk to you tonight about anything that I've said, or you realize, man, I've

842
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,700
 got an identity crisis.

843
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,900
 There's going to be a team of folks, really anyone with the yellow light bulb on their

844
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:38,380
 shirt shirt that says the porch would love to engage with you and pray with you and talk

845
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:42,060
 with you and help you in any way that they possibly can.

846
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:45,820
 If you're here and you're in college, we have a party for you as you go out there.

847
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,060
 Where is it exactly?

848
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,260
 Stage two, which you're going to go up the stairs and walk that way.

849
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,820
 As you keep walking that way, you're going to see some folks.

850
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:56,340
 And so you can go into stage two, ask anybody where it is.

851
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,380
 There's a party for you if you're here and you're in college.

852
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,140

853
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,380
 So don't go through this break alone.

854
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:09,280
 Don't go through this break without community guys down this hallway in a room right there.

855
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,860
