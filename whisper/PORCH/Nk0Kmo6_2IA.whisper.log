[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.020]   All right.
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.180]   Hello, friends in the room.
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.300]   Hello, Fort Worth.
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.180]   Any Disney World fans in this room?
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.340]   Anyone been to Disney World recently, like in the last year?
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.940]   There you go.
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.440]   OK.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.340]   Is Disney World still awesome?
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.900]   Is it?
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.780]   Yeah?
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.460]   I definitely was when you were a kid, but it's like,
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.420]   this is amazing.
[00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.900]   So I'm going to tell a story that will kind of give us
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.460]   tracks forward.
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.180]   We're going about my one and only Disney World experience.
[00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.540]   We went as a family, family vacation.
[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.540]   I was seven years old.
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.460]   I have three siblings.
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.020]   So me, the three siblings, and my two parents
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.340]   all went to Disney World.
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.300]   And it was amazing.
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.740]   Epcot, Magic Kingdom, whole nine yards.
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.420]   And on one of the days, we went to the Magic Kingdom.
[00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.460]   And the Magic Kingdom, stay there the whole day,
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.740]   stay there until the night.
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.940]   And Magic Kingdom is like the epicenter of Disney.
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.500]   They do this unbelievable fireworks show at night.
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.260]   Has anyone seen this before?
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.860]   It's like NASA gave them fireworks or something.
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.260]   They're like, are we still doing shuttles to the moon?
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.580]   Send this stuff to Disney.
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.580]   And they have these unbelievable,
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.860]   like things you've never seen before, light show fireworks.
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.500]   So we're there.
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.060]   It's at night.
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.900]   We gather.
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.820]   We're with all the people, huge crowd around us,
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.620]   me, three siblings, seven years old, watching the fireworks.
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.340]   It's awesome.
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.060]   And I look around.
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.060]   And there's these different little light fixtures
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.940]   in the ground.
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.060]   They're lights that would shoot up into the air.
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.260]   And they were like different colors.
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.060]   And you could walk around.
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.260]   And as you're seven, you're like, this is amazing.
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.700]   Purple.
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.020]   And it would make all your clothes purple.
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.780]   You'd send another one.
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.860]   Blue, make them blue.
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.700]   So I'm like walking over these lights,
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.100]   because I've always struggled with ADD.
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.220]   And the fireworks didn't keep me in check.
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.660]   And so I'm walking--
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.820]   I know, big shocker.
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.140]   So I'm walking over these lights.
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.940]   And I'm looking down at them.
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.700]   I'm standing there.
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.980]   And I'm like, this is amazing.
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.260]   And all of a sudden, someone comes up from behind me
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.980]   and pulls down my pants.
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.980]   And I mean everything.
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.060]   I'm exposed in front of Mickey, Minnie, and all of Disney World
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.860]   combined to see everything.
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.140]   And when you're seven, what else do you have to live for?
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.980]   So I look around.
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.540]   My older brother is taking off.
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.460]   So I begin running after him in that direction.
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.620]   He clearly had done this.
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.380]   So I'm chasing him.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.020]   And now we're moving through the crowd of people,
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.300]   pushing women and children.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.020]   And I'm trying to retaliate, get revenge on him.
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.940]   So you're going, where are we going with this?
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.140]   Can we talk about the Bible?
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.140]   And I'm running after him, pushing himself away.
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.500]   And I see him begin to run towards my parents.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.220]   And I'm like, perfect, back into the arms of justice.
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.700]   Perfect.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.380]   So we show up, get to my parents.
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.780]   And of course, my dad is upset.
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.460]   But dads are always upset on vacation.
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.060]   And so he's like, everyone in the car.
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.540]   Let's go.
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.460]   We're leaving.
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.420]   We get in the car, all four of us.
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.780]   And I'm like, just waiting for the punishment that
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.500]   is going to be relinquished on my brother.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.380]   How could he do that?
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.100]   He's a bad apple.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.900]   I agree with you.
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.460]   And so I'm waiting for this to happen.
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.460]   And my parents were not like the time out people.
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.380]   These are before that.
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.540]   They were the laying on of hands and a firm hand.
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.340]   You got the belt if you got in trouble.
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.540]   And so I'm waiting for this.
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.060]   How many spankings are we going to get, is what I'm thinking.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.220]   How many is he going to get?
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.460]   One, two, maybe three to commemorate this experience.
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.540]   And all of a sudden, my dad says, David,
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.700]   you're going to get it.
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.180]   And I'm like, wait, time out.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.980]   I go into seven-year-old lawyer mode.
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.540]   Wait a second.
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.900]   Just to make sure we have the facts straight here,
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.620]   I got pants in front of everybody.
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.220]   Remember that?
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.780]   Mickey, Minnie, everybody saw everything around us.
[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.940]   And I'm the one in trouble.
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.980]   And he says, I don't care.
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.140]   You ran through the park, pushed people around.
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.380]   You embarrassed your parents.
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.140]   You're getting a spanking.
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.380]   I'm going, wait a second, Tom.
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.460]   I'm the victim here.
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.460]   Me, pantalones, on the ground.
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.220]   Me, not him.
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.380]   Why am I being punished?
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.700]   He says, you're the one who's getting a spanking right
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.060]   when we get back.
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.860]   I continue to try to duke it out.
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.140]   And I go, this is so unfair.
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.140]   This is so unjust.
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.260]   You know what happened?
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.700]   And finally, he agrees--
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.100]   I can't believe this actually happened.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.740]   He agrees, I will let you not have a spanking,
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.380]   but you have to write a letter, a letter,
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.820]   to everyone in the family apologizing for ruining
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.860]   the magical kingdom.
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.540]   And I still to this day remember writing, I'm sorry.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.380]   I got pants that did nothing wrong
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.460]   to everyone in the family.
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.820]   And it was just like, this is so unjust.
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.300]   Honestly, that's the earliest experience that I remember,
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.940]   of feeling like this is just an injustice.
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.940]   This is so unfair.
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.100]   This is wrong.
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.540]   I was the victim here.
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.980]   And there's something inside of us.
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.340]   Anytime that we are the victim in a situation
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.460]   where we want justice, we want retaliation,
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.140]   our natural response.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.140]   And the reason I start there is because tonight,
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.820]   as we continue this series through the Sermon on the Mount
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.580]   and our series this summer on the Mount,
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.180]   Jesus is going to tell us what he says all Christians
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.180]   everywhere are to do in the face of injustice against them.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.460]   In the face of when someone else hurts them,
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.380]   when someone else harms them, when someone else hates them,
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.820]   he says, this is what you are to do.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.940]   Because I know that situation is kind of funny,
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.900]   but all of us in the room have one thing in common.
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.060]   Throughout our life, there will be various points
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.860]   where you are wrongfully hurt by someone,
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.340]   where you are the victim of other people's decisions,
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.060]   where someone hurts you, maybe someone hates you.
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.300]   Maybe it's at work with a coworker who always seems
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.940]   to like intentionally try to make you look bad.
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.500]   Or it's that one friend who spoke bad about you
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.900]   behind your back and now you don't trust anyone.
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.420]   Maybe it's a boss who just runs over you,
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.620]   neighbors who are always living, or who live above you,
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.380]   who are like always partying and you're like,
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.780]   it's a Wednesday, what are you doing up there?
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.780]   Maybe it's a parent who just walked out
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.540]   and they weren't what a mother or a father
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.380]   was supposed to be.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.380]   Maybe it was a spouse that hurt you, that cheated on you,
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.620]   that all of us will face this.
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.580]   Honestly, probably the most clear place in this stage
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.460]   that we'll face it is like in the dating
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.740]   and relationship realm, where someone goes from,
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.300]   hey, they were calling me their bae before anyone else,
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.220]   and now they don't call me at all.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.220]   And when I do see them, they're hurtful, and mean.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.620]   But all of us will face just different circumstances
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.340]   where we are wrongfully hurt or wrongfully harmed,
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.020]   and so how are we to respond in those situations?
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.580]   So tonight, Jesus is gonna explore that,
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.540]   and we're gonna see some of his most radical teachings
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.620]   on relationships, and here's what I know
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.820]   just before we dive in.
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.420]   What Jesus is going to say, this is just a guarantee
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.260]   for you guys and for Fort Worth.
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.580]   What Jesus is about to say about how you and I,
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.580]   or how Christians, are to relate to those who hurt us,
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.860]   how we're to really exist in relationships,
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.060]   if you and I embrace it, if you embrace it,
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.740]   it will change your world.
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.140]   The teachings we're gonna talk about,
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.220]   your circle, your relationships, and if the church,
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.860]   if every person in our country or in our world
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.580]   who claims the name of Jesus embraces
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.500]   what Jesus is about to say, it will change our world.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.140]   So we're gonna pick it up in Matthew chapter five.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.800]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open there right now.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.780]   Matthew chapter five, Matthew's the very first book
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.300]   of the New Testament.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.260]   If you hit Mark, Luke, John, or really anything
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.580]   with Ippians on it, you need to flip back
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.340]   and go back to Matthew, and we'll be in chapter five
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.820]   as Jesus just continues this teaching
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.180]   on the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.860]   If you don't have a Bible, we've got some
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.580]   in the Welcome Center, and those are our gift to you,
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.620]   so you can take that afterwards.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.620]   It's gonna be on the screen, I believe, if not.
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.780]   So we'll pick it up in verse 38, and here we go.
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.100]   You have heard that it was said, Jesus speaking,
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.340]   to this crowd in front of him on a hillside.
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.540]   You have heard that it was said, an eye for an eye
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.700]   and a tooth for a tooth.
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.980]   But I tell you, do not resist an evil person,
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.860]   and if anyone slaps you on the right cheek,
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.200]   turn to him the other cheek also.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.280]   So Jesus just quotes an Old Testament verse
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.300]   about eye for an eye, which is a metaphor
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.700]   for a justice system.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.900]   It's essentially, it was common in Jesus' day
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.580]   that the punishment needed to fit the crime,
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.340]   that basically if someone caused you to lose an eye,
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.220]   they need to lose an eye.
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.660]   If someone caused you to lose a camel,
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.140]   they need to lose a camel, that there needs to be
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.500]   a repayment that fits the punishment of the crime,
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.980]   that getting even was a part of an allowance
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.820]   inside of that law.
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.980]   It's really, I mean, when you think about it,
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.260]   it's like, yeah, it's a pretty good law.
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.060]   We would all say that today, even today.
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.500]   We think, as it relates to relationships,
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.700]   we are about getting payback, aren't we?
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.820]   I mean, when it comes to someone who hurt me
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.440]   or someone who did something, and I may not do
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.980]   the exact hurt against them that they did against me,
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.680]   but my mind runs to, I need to pay this person back.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.420]   I need to be mean to them because they were hurtful to me.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.180]   And the way that I want to treat them
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.940]   is about getting payback.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.380]   That's my initial reaction, or really all of us
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.020]   in the room have that reaction.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.540]   With that girl who breaks girl code
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.020]   and starts braiding, dating your, braiding?
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.380]   Braiding your old boyfriend.
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.700]   They're braiding his hair.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.940]   And starts dating your old boyfriend.
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.680]   It's like, I'm gonna cut you off from my life.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.380]   Jesus may love you, but I do not.
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.880]   That coworker who makes you look bad,
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.220]   we begin taking opportunities to get payback.
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.400]   And eye for an eye, I'm going to,
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.760]   and it may not be a perfect eye for an eye,
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.600]   but I'm going to do something to make you pay for it.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.880]   Maybe it's apparent that we're just,
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.040]   I'm gonna cut you off relationally
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.800]   to make you be punished for what you've done.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.160]   Or the girl who broke up with you
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.840]   because she wasn't ready to date,
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.000]   and then on Facebook, a week later,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.420]   it's like, she's ready to date with someone else,
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.440]   apparently, and we're just going,
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.820]   I'm just gonna talk bad about you.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.540]   And Jesus says, I want to give you
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.300]   an entire new way of relating to people,
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.600]   and it's not to hit them back,
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.220]   and he uses the metaphor of turning
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.060]   the other cheek when struck, but it's still a metaphor.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.700]   He says, don't hit them back.
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.900]   Don't hit replay on the situation
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.000]   and just drive around in your car,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.940]   listening to Taylor Swift like,
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.900]   ♪ Now we got bad blood ♪
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.900]   ♪ We used to have ♪
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.740]   Oh man.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.260]   ♪ Now we ♪
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.460]   I don't know, I just keep singing up here.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.340]   It's like, is this a concert?
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.780]   Where are we at right now?
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.780]   It's not to do that.
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:47.880]   It's not to listen around,
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.180]   driving around listening to Taylor Swift.
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.260]   He says, I don't want you to hit replay,
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.660]   and I don't want you to hit back,
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.940]   but here's what I want you to do.
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.020]   Turn the other cheek if someone strikes you,
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.500]   and he introduces this metaphor,
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.020]   and really, essentially, here's what Jesus is saying.
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.420]   I don't want my people,
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.180]   if you wanna know what a Christian response
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.860]   to someone who hurts you is,
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.500]   it's not to be about hurting them back or retaliation.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.980]   It's about reconciliation.
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.700]   What do Christians do when they're hurt?
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.100]   They don't seek on getting retaliation,
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.380]   but on reconciliation.
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.500]   He says, I want to introduce how you were to relate
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.920]   when someone hurts you.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.380]   Our first point is a Christian's response
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.580]   to those who harm them is forgiveness,
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.020]   that he describes just like in turning the other cheek,
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.940]   eye for an eye is a metaphor, so is turning the other cheek.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.420]   It's not just, oh yeah, come on, keep it coming.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.700]   It is starting new with that person,
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.060]   removing the hurt and starting over,
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.260]   forgiving that person, Jesus says.
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.780]   Anytime that someone hurts you, someone hurts me,
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.740]   the response, a Christian's response
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.460]   to someone who hurts them is forgiveness.
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.200]   It's like, Jesus, that's a little extreme.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.860]   In every situation, no matter what they've done,
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.020]   I'm supposed to forgive them?
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.460]   And he says, yes, to every hurt and to every harm,
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.820]   to the person who lied about you behind your back,
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:11.080]   to that parent, the response is to turn the other cheek,
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.120]   to start new, to forgive them.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.640]   To DeAndre Jordan, when he says, I'm coming,
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:22.020]   and then says, just kidding, to forgive.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.460]   That our response in every situation,
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.620]   from big and small, is that you are to forgive them.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.180]   Don't take a step back and plot revenge
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.540]   or take a step back and replay the tapes on how could they.
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.400]   Take a step forward towards reconciling the relationships.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.520]   And I think where I get stuck is I begin to think,
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.500]   look, if I do that, I'm going to look weak
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.660]   or it's going to appear weak or that's just weak.
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.060]   I'm just letting them run all over me.
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.020]   And the Bible teaches this crazy thing.
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.340]   Retaliation is not a sign of strength.
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.300]   It's a sign of weakness.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.620]   God, in fact, says, don't retaliate.
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.720]   I want you to trust me.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.460]   In Romans 12, retaliation is a sign of weakness
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.420]   'cause it says, I don't trust that you, God,
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.700]   who say vengeance is yours, are going to do what is right.
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.880]   And Jesus says, it is a sign of weakness if you retaliate.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.680]   I want you to turn the other cheek, forgive that person,
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.820]   and to trust God that there will be a day
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.980]   where there is reckoning, where God says, vengeance is mine,
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.220]   and he doesn't look at you and me
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.180]   and all the hurts that you experience and say,
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.820]   it's not because I don't care.
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.440]   It's not because what they did wasn't wrong.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.780]   All of it was wrong.
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.700]   That hurt, that abuse, that pain, everything was wrong.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.180]   And it's not because I want them to get away with it
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.640]   or I don't care about how you're feeling.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.780]   That's not why God does it.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.280]   It's because I care about you and there is a day
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.140]   where I am going to have a reckoning for every abuse,
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.460]   every pain, everything that's ever been done wrong.
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.780]   And I'm inviting you now to forgive
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.380]   and to turn the other cheek.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.340]   That I don't look lightly on the pains of my children,
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.900]   but now I want you to forgive.
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.140]   God is like the ultimate father
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.620]   that's like sitting on the front porch with a shotgun.
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.460]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.200]   He's like in a wife theater like, have her home by 10.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.460]   And you're like, I'm just gonna have her home now, okay.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.260]   That's who God is, that he says that to all of his children.
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.180]   There will be no wrongs that do not get made right
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.980]   or there will be no wrongs where there isn't a reckoning for
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.580]   and I'm inviting you now to forgive.
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.740]   The Christian response in every situation
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.620]   which feels extreme, Jesus says,
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.800]   is to turn the other cheek or to forgive.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.900]   And let me say this really quickly.
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:37.900]   This is a side note on physical abuse in marriage.
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.760]   More conversations probably in the last 10 days
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.740]   have I had or our team had with people
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.220]   who have been a part of an abusive relationship.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.860]   And so what I wanna make really, really clear,
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.100]   'cause this has been something that's come up a lot.
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.620]   Are you saying that Jesus' teaching on divorce
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.300]   and remarriage and is the teaching on turn the other cheek,
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.300]   does that mean that God wants them to go back
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.180]   into an abusive environment?
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.840]   No.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.840]   If someone is in a violent environment,
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.900]   we based on the character of God would say
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.500]   they need to step out of that environment
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.060]   because it's not loving.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.700]   Jesus' whole point is be about reconciling the relationship
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.740]   and it is all to be done in love
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.540]   and it's not loving to stay there
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.860]   and be abused.
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.940]   The most loving thing is to get out,
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.960]   pray for that person, pursue reconciliation
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.260]   by just praying for them.
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.380]   Call the police if they're in an abusive environment.
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.700]   But as a church, if someone is in your community group,
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.400]   if that's a question you need to know,
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.780]   how you would answer that.
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.480]   We would never say to stay in a place
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.300]   where you are potentially in danger
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.500]   and we do not believe that God would.
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.660]   And the most loving thing in that scenario
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.660]   is not to stay there and just turn the other cheek,
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.840]   but to remove yourself 'cause his point
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.020]   is reconciliation of a relationship.
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.740]   So inside of marriage, that would be the answer
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.700]   that Jesus keeps going and really addresses
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.220]   what to do if we harm someone.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.940]   Verse 40, if anyone wants to sue you
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.260]   and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well.
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.940]   So anyone sues you, that would be a time
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.260]   where you've done something wrong.
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.220]   So they're gonna sue you and he essentially says,
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.860]   hey, don't just do the bare minimum.
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.540]   If you wronged that person, don't go,
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.180]   hey, what's the bare minimum I can do here?
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.540]   Make it right.
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.500]   Be about restoring the relationship,
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.420]   reconciliation, verse 41.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.560]   If anyone forces you to go a mile,
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.780]   go with them two miles.
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.260]   Give to the one who asks of you
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.860]   and do not turn away from the one
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.300]   who wants to borrow from you.
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.900]   Now here, when we read that, everyone's like,
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.700]   what, Jesus is concerned about how far I walk?
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.320]   What Jesus just said, everyone in his audience
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.780]   is now sucking air because what Jesus just said
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.380]   pointed to something that was very a part
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.140]   of their every single day life.
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.260]   Here's what he just said.
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.380]   If someone asks you to go a mile, go with them two.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.620]   Here's why that was a part of everyday life.
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.260]   Inside of where they were right now,
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.580]   which is in Jerusalem and in Judea, which is that area,
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.260]   the entire area and really the known world
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:02.320]   was ruled by this one army, Rome,
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.060]   by the Roman army, by the Roman Empire.
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.260]   And so everywhere that you went,
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.480]   anywhere inside of the empire,
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.580]   there were soldiers everywhere
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.500]   because Rome was ruthless and they wanted to make sure
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.240]   you don't mess with, you mess with the bull,
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.100]   you get the horns.
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.780]   And so if you mess with Rome, you're going to pay for it.
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.500]   So they put soldiers everywhere.
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.220]   How did they pay for those soldiers?
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.820]   They taxed their people 80 to 90%.
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:23.800]   Imagine that.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.620]   We're like, Obamacare, and they're 80 to 90%.
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.460]   80 to 9%.
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.620]   And so of course, everyone is,
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.940]   it's not a statement or official stance on Obamacare.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.020]   That's more just like taxes.
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.320]   Save the email.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.820]   Okay, so everyone in this time is going,
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.980]   we hate Rome because we're giving everything
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.540]   we have away to have soldiers around
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.820]   that basically have hurt our siblings,
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.480]   have hurt our cousins, some of them been killed
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.860]   and crucified, all by these Roman soldiers who we hate.
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.180]   And they had this one law that said any,
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.440]   this is the mile thing, any Roman soldier, Roman law,
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.300]   and if you step out of line with Roman law, you die.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.500]   And any Roman soldier can come up to any civilian they want
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.380]   and say, carry my armor for a mile.
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.040]   It was a Roman law to give soldiers a break.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.080]   So any civilian, any Jewish person,
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.040]   they could come up and say, I want you to carry the weapons
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.700]   that were used to kill some of your family members
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:18.980]   for a mile.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.580]   And they had to do it.
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.940]   And so of course, they're going, we hate this law.
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:23.780]   We hate that.
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.020]   And Jesus looks at them and says,
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.700]   I want you to carry it two miles.
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.900]   I mean, think about that.
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.700]   Think about it today if there was a law like that
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.460]   and the police were like, yeah, I need you to drive me
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.300]   for the next mile.
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.460]   Or if you're living in the first century,
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.260]   how do you even make plans with people?
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.900]   And you're like, yeah, you wanna meet at Petalicious
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.920]   in Jerusalem and we'll go down there.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.120]   And you're like, they never show up.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:45.960]   They got caught.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.480]   They had to walk a mile and then they had to walk
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.320]   a mile back.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.360]   And every single day and everywhere they looked,
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.400]   this would be enforced.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.800]   And Jesus just said, even to your enemies,
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.280]   I want you to go above and beyond in loving them.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.240]   And it's as though they're going, Jesus,
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.880]   how can we do that with our enemies?
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.440]   And he says, on the note of enemies, let's go there next.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.300]   You've heard that it was said, verse 43,
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.400]   love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.380]   Finally, Jesus, these audiences, thank you,
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.000]   you're saying something we agree with.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.320]   Love your neighbor, hate your enemy.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:23.320]   But I tell you, love your enemies and pray
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.760]   for those who persecute you,
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.540]   that you may be children of your Father in heaven.
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:32.840]   He causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.500]   and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.780]   That no longer, Jesus says, for my followers,
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.200]   is the standard, love their neighbor and hate their enemy.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.600]   I don't want there to be any boundaries on love.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.460]   All people, you are to not love.
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.180]   And really, what's crazy is pray for your enemies.
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.800]   Think, to us, you may have heard it before
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.500]   and you're like, yeah, it's so beautiful.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.940]   To them, they're hearing it for the very first time,
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.880]   they go, Jesus, pray for your enemies.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.480]   Enemies to us is kind of abstract.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.880]   To them, it was this guy in the Roman armor.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.280]   And they're going, pray for our enemies?
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.120]   You want us to pray?
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.600]   Jesus, we don't even pray for our friends.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.040]   You serious, pray for our enemies?
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.860]   I mean, most of us, we pray for like grandma
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.280]   and this food and one sick guy that we know.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.320]   And you're telling us to pray for our enemies?
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.800]   How radical is this?
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.240]   And Jesus says, yes, even them, I want you to pray for.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.620]   That I want no boundaries to be put on love.
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:30.680]   And I think as an American, where I get caught in like,
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.880]   how do I apply this?
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.540]   Like, who are my enemies?
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.280]   ISIS, Time Warner Cable?
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.220]   Like, who is my enemy?
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.180]   AT&T?
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:43.520]   And I think what Jesus would say,
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.880]   if you don't think you have enemies, great.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.320]   The standard is love all people.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.760]   Love the people who on social media
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.760]   call you a bigot for what you believe.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.060]   Love the people who hate you
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.600]   because the color of your skin.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.580]   Love the people who treat you poorly at work.
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.040]   Love every single person.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.180]   Your response is to be loved and to pray for them.
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:10.280]   And I love the next verse, which says in 45,
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.340]   that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven.
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:19.160]   That you will look in doing so like your Father.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.240]   Like, what do children do as it relates to their parents?
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.080]   They look like them.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.100]   My wife is pregnant right now.
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.440]   She's 18 weeks pregnant.
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.600]   And every time that we go to the doctor,
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.600]   they do a sonogram, which is a really interesting experience
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.280]   but save that for another time.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.120]   And so while we're there,
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.080]   they will show us the baby inside of her.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.760]   And it looks like a little alien right now,
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.960]   but here's what I know.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.480]   The more that it grows and develops,
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.360]   and the older and more mature that it gets,
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.720]   the more it's going to look like its parents.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.880]   Hopefully its mother.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.760]   But the more that it continues to grow,
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.280]   the more it looks like its parents.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.040]   Because children look like their parents,
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.280]   just kind of the way things work.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.200]   And Jesus just said, here's what I want you to do.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.680]   I want you to be the kind of person
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.620]   that even in the face of hatred,
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.360]   the Christian response toward those who hate us,
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.400]   which is our second point, is love.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.400]   I want you to do that.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.380]   And when you do that, here's what you look like.
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.080]   You look like your Father in heaven.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.080]   He's a God who loves his enemies.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.240]   He's a God who loves those who run from him.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.040]   He's a God who loves bad people.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.320]   As bad as you may be in the room, if you don't know that,
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.800]   God is a God who loves you right now where you are.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.120]   He's a God who loves every person that's ever lived,
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.000]   ever been born, made in his image.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.480]   And he says, when you love like that,
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.340]   you love and you look like your Dad in heaven.
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:42.240]   There's actually a story of someone in the Bible
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:48.520]   who in dying, prays for those persecuting him,
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.200]   or prays for those who are killing him.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.120]   You know who it is?
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.280]   Jesus, there you go.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.200]   Safe church answer, I like that.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.440]   It's Jesus on the cross, Luke 23.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.920]   Says that even in the Son of God's last breaths,
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.840]   he knows everything, he knows everything
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.280]   that they would ever do, and he looks out
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.040]   at those who just drove nails through the palms of his hands
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.080]   and he says, Father, forgive these men.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.520]   Have mercy on these men.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.360]   Forgive them.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:23.640]   That even in his dying breaths, he loves his enemies.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.640]   But there's actually another place in Scripture
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.480]   and another man who says something eerily similar
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.080]   to what Jesus said.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.920]   Anyone know who it is?
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.440]   Stephen, man, we have the most educated crowd, I love it.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.940]   Stephen, so let me tell you about Stephen
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:40.780]   if you're new in the room.
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.440]   Stephen, who says something very similar.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.280]   Here's who Stephen is.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.080]   Stephen is the very first martyr of the church.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.280]   No one's ever been killed, no one had been persecuted
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.160]   other than Jesus.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.680]   The church movement begins and Stephen would become
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.180]   the very first martyr, but here's how it begins.
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.920]   Jesus goes back to heaven and really,
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.420]   the movement explodes.
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.700]   There's like thousands of people getting saved,
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.960]   things are taking off, they're going well.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.940]   And there's so many people that they begin to realize,
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.160]   oh my gosh, the 12 dudes, they're not gonna cut it.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.380]   We need a details guy.
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.840]   Peter, you're not a details guy.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.620]   We need somebody who can execute around here.
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.920]   So they bring in a guy named Stephen.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.260]   Stephen is a details guy.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.980]   Anyone, anyone, any detail people in the room?
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:18.820]   God bless you people.
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.740]   Anyone who's like Excel spreadsheet,
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.860]   holla at your girl, that's me, okay.
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:23.700]   That's Stephen.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.100]   Stephen is a guy who's like, I'm a details guy,
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.460]   I'm an executor, I love Excel, that's who he is.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:34.140]   And Stephen is put in charge inside of thousands of people
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.780]   of caring for the widows and the orphans,
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.420]   making sure they get food, making sure they get all this.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.180]   And that's who Stephen is.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.900]   And shortly after that, Stephen really begins going around
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.140]   and his new faith, he begins sharing his faith everywhere.
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.100]   He begins going around the city of Jerusalem saying,
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.820]   hey Jesus, if you trust in Jesus, you can have eternal life.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.060]   If you believe in Jesus, he's the Messiah.
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.660]   And he goes all over the city and pretty soon,
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.300]   this Sanhedrin or the like court system,
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.900]   Jewish religious leaders found out
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.220]   that Stephen is preaching?
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.820]   Nah, Stephen is going around.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.420]   We were okay with the 12 dudes, they're a little off it.
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.260]   We're okay with that.
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.720]   But Stephen, we know Stephen, he's going around telling,
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.580]   Jesus is the only way?
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.880]   Uh-uh, that's bad for business.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.100]   Bring Stephen in here.
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.180]   They bring Stephen, they drag him and they throw him
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.380]   in front of the Sanhedrin, which is the court of the day.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.380]   And they throw him in front of the court.
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.860]   And they say, Stephen, we hear that you've been telling
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.700]   people Jesus is the Messiah, is it true?
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.180]   And this is in Acts 6, 7, and 8,
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.500]   if you wanna go read it later.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.740]   And he says, yes, Jesus is, he's the only way
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:34.820]   to eternal life.
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.260]   And they bring in these different people,
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.540]   some men in the crowd bring in different people
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.840]   to make accusations, to make up accusations,
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.940]   lies about him.
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.740]   Well, I saw him do this, I saw him do this.
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.900]   And Stephen says, I didn't do any of that.
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.380]   All I did was say, Jesus is the only way.
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.260]   And anyone who believes in him will not perish,
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.500]   but has eternal life.
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.220]   And they look at Stephen and he begins to give
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.780]   this incredible speech.
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:25:59.980]   You can go read it later.
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.100]   And at the end of the speech, which culminates in him
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.740]   saying, Jesus alone, trust in Jesus,
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.340]   they rip their clothes.
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.580]   And the Sanhedrin says, this man deserves to die.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.780]   And they drag him outside of the city.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.100]   And they prepare to stone him.
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.240]   Outside of crucifixion, stoning was one of the worst ways
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.080]   to die.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.140]   They pelt you with rocks until you're dead.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.820]   And Stephen looking at these men who are beginning
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.040]   to stone him says two last things.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.940]   The last two things or sentences he would ever say.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.740]   And the first one is eerily similar to what we just read.
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.420]   He looks into the eyes of the men who were pelting him
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.600]   with rocks.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.460]   And he says, father, forgive these men.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.220]   Have mercy on them, God.
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.680]   They don't know what they're doing.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.080]   He looks like Jesus.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.460]   And then he says something else that only appears here
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.560]   in all of the Bible.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.220]   It says in one of his last statements,
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.700]   he's sitting there on the ground and they say his face
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.740]   shunned like an angel.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.980]   And all of a sudden they see Stephen looking up
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.060]   at the heavens.
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:03.380]   And he says, I see the heavens open.
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:07.300]   And the son of God is standing at the right hand of God.
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:11.020]   Standing, Stephen, you see Jesus standing.
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.540]   Standing, why is that significant?
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.860]   And every other place in the Bible,
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.620]   Jesus is always seated at the right hand of God.
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.900]   And there's a lot of them, Old and New Testament.
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.400]   And it's as though in Stephen's last breaths,
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.920]   Jesus who looks down and says,
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.300]   I'm gonna see you in a second.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.140]   But he rises like the crowd when a bride enters the room
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.220]   to give a standing ovation to this man
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.740]   who looks like his daddy.
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.960]   That's my boy.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.780]   And he looks like Jesus.
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.580]   Father, forgive these men.
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:46.260]   The only time we see the son of God rise,
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.300]   kings don't rise.
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.320]   They're always seated victorious.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:57.540]   And Jesus stands as he sees the son or a man
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:01.300]   who looks like his father in heaven,
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:05.660]   loving even his enemies, even in his last breaths.
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.780]   And he calls all of us that the response to those
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.980]   who hate us and hurt us is love.
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:19.420]   And he finishes up and really gives our final response.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.060]   He says this in verse 46.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:27.420]   If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.380]   Are not even tax collectors doing that?
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.660]   And if you greet only your own people,
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.080]   what are you doing more than others?
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.060]   Don't even pagans or people who don't believe in God
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.100]   at all do that?
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:44.660]   Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly father is perfect.
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:49.660]   You and I are to treat others like God treats his enemies
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:53.820]   or like God has treated us.
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.380]   Essentially what he just said, be perfect.
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.440]   I want you to be in the way you respond to others perfect.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.620]   That's the goal.
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.620]   And by perfection, I mean the same way God responds
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.940]   to his enemies, the same way God responds.
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:08.580]   In other words, a Christian responds
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:12.700]   the way Christ has responded to them.
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:16.500]   A Christian responds to all people, all their enemies,
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.240]   the way God responds to his enemies
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.740]   or the way God has responded to them,
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.180]   that we as believers in Jesus, he says,
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:26.940]   are to treat others who hurt us, not as they've treated us,
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:31.500]   but as God has treated us.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.780]   That you and I are to treat in the response,
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.820]   regardless of the situation, which is such a tall order,
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.700]   are not to treat them the way they treated us
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.780]   or even the way others say, yeah, I would do this,
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.780]   but the way God has treated us
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.020]   or the way God has treated his enemies,
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.380]   of which we were a part.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:56.500]   Probably the clearest portrait of Jesus loving his enemies,
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.860]   I read this past week and it was so powerful to me
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.380]   'cause I've never noticed it before.
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.960]   It's in Jesus's last day on earth.
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.860]   Like he's got one more day left
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.700]   and what he decides to do with his time
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.860]   is he gets all of his boys together
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.500]   at what's called the last supper.
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.460]   And he doesn't do what you and I would wanna do,
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:18.860]   hey, what can we do on the last day?
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:19.940]   I've got one day left.
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.020]   Doesn't do what we do.
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:24.900]   He begins to get down on his hands and knees
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.140]   and do what only a servant did.
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.700]   Here's what it says in John 13.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.560]   The evening meal was in progress, verse two,
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.960]   and the devil had already prompted Judas,
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.080]   who's at the meal, so it's Jesus and the 12 boys,
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.800]   including Judas, who's already decided
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.920]   I'm gonna betray this man for 30 shekels of silver.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.040]   I'm betraying him.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.800]   Luke 23 says that Judas had some way,
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.600]   in some way, been inhabited by Satan,
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.040]   that he'd given his heart over to the point
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.020]   where Satan was a part of it.
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:02.480]   And now Jesus sitting there with his 12 boys
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.880]   and Judas, who's already inhabited
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.440]   or given himself over to Satan,
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.280]   to betray Jesus, is sitting there with him.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.200]   And what does Jesus do?
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.840]   The devil had already prompted Judas,
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.960]   the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.440]   Jesus knew that the Father had put all things
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.720]   under his power, that he could do anything.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.120]   I could blink and Judas would just disappear.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.780]   And that he had come from God and was returning to God,
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.040]   so he got up from the meal,
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.600]   he took off his outer clothing,
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.540]   he wrapped a towel around his waist,
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:39.520]   and after that he poured water into a basin
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.940]   and he began washing the disciples' feet,
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:45.000]   drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.340]   That Jesus, in his last moments,
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:47.960]   he gets down on his hands and knees.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:51.020]   The Son of God, perfection in sandals,
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.640]   gets on his knees and he begins washing the feet.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.560]   Here's why that's significant.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.240]   Rabbis didn't wash feet.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.800]   Normal people didn't wash feet.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.200]   That was only for a servant.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.340]   This would only be something that would happen
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.920]   when you'd go into the home of someone
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.480]   who had means enough to have a servant.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.280]   It's like going to the home of someone today
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.160]   that has means enough to have a valet or something.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.360]   You're like, you have a valet?
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.620]   Really, where does he sleep?
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.040]   It's like showing up at a house like that
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.640]   and only rich people would have this
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.680]   and Jesus takes the role of a servant and he gets down
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.640]   and he begins taking off the sandals
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.520]   and washing these feet that are caked with dirt
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.040]   from being in a desert climate
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:30.920]   and he begins doing what only a servant would do.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:35.320]   God begins washing and he doesn't just choose the 11.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.520]   He looks his enemy, Judas, who's inhabited by Satan
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.280]   and he looks him in the eyes
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.200]   and he begins washing his feet
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.360]   that even in his last moments, he would have a Judas.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.540]   He still loves, I love Judas.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:53.420]   I'm gonna die for him in all of humanity.
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.560]   That's how God responds to his enemies
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.100]   and tonight, what I wanna make really clear
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:02.660]   is the invitation that Jesus calls all of us to
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:06.260]   is he says, I want you to love like that.
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:10.660]   I want you to treat others who've hurt you,
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.740]   not the way that they treated you,
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.260]   but the way God has treated you
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.660]   or the way God treats his enemies
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.380]   and the message tonight is not just,
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.220]   hey, go love like that because outside
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.460]   of realizing that inside of that story,
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.320]   who you are, that's impossible.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.260]   In other words, in that story,
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:32.660]   you're not called to just go love the Judases in your life
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.060]   or be Jesus to the Judases.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.580]   You are Judas and so am I
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:40.980]   and the God of the universe got down on his hands and knees
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:45.780]   and he washed your feet, came to serve
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.580]   and he died on a cross for his enemies
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.460]   and outside of first encountering that,
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.920]   if you leave here and you're like, yeah,
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.900]   I'm gonna go just try to love the Judases in my life,
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.960]   if you don't realize you are Judas,
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.220]   and you don't encounter that God's love
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.420]   for you in that moment, despite everything you've ever done,
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.660]   every silver that you've ever turned to,
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.940]   every pain pill, every pornography
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.400]   or pornographic image you've looked at,
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.500]   every time that you've slept with that guy or that girl,
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.740]   that all of those things that he said,
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:18.140]   I know they're coming and I'm gonna die for you
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:20.460]   and it's encountering that,
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.860]   that we're able to both be loved
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:25.900]   and then to give that same love that we received.
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.760]   John, who was known as the,
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.020]   he called himself the disciple Jesus loved.
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:32.860]   You think about that?
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.940]   Like how weird would that be?
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.220]   I'm the guy that JP loves.
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:38.260]   He's calling himself, he was so familiar
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.500]   and so in belief that Jesus loves me.
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:45.500]   Well, am I driven by the fact of how much I love Jesus?
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.780]   No, I'm driven by I'm the one Jesus loves.
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.500]   He saw himself that way
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.780]   and it would be like all of us
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.140]   should see ourselves that way, he would say.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:55.980]   I mean, if you're reading what John,
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.860]   his gospel, in the gospel he says,
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.180]   the disciple Jesus loved.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.540]   If you're the other disciples, you're like,
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.760]   John, take it easy, buddy, you loved all of us.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.380]   But John's like, he loved me.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:10.020]   And John would write in his last years,
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.220]   you know how we love, you know why we love?
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:18.460]   In 1 John 4, we love because God first loved us.
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.600]   That's how we love and that's why we love.
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.820]   And God's invitation is not just go love
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.580]   the Judas's in your life.
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:30.340]   Realize you are a Judas and he's loved you.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.860]   And in encountering that,
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:37.040]   you'll be able to extend that love to others.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:44.300]   I think the application in this room,
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.780]   like what does it look like to apply this radical
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:52.420]   relationship, love driven message?
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:57.260]   For all of us, as we look back in our past,
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.580]   there's probably relationships hurt,
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.740]   things that were done against you,
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.380]   relationships today that are broken,
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:04.580]   parents who walked out,
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:10.220]   relationships in dating that just didn't end well,
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.500]   mistakes that you made, mistakes that were made against you.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.660]   And I think there's two responses that all of us,
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:18.220]   as we work towards reconciliation, not retaliation,
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:21.480]   as we forgive like we've been forgiven,
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.720]   and love like we've been loved,
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.120]   the first application is some of you in the room
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:32.100]   need to extend forgiveness to someone who's in your past.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:36.920]   Maybe there were a parent who hit your mom.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.960]   Maybe they hit you.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.000]   Maybe it was someone you were dating
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.800]   and she got pregnant and they went and had an abortion
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.400]   and they never involved you in that,
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.840]   you still carry pain from it.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.000]   Maybe it's just someone that you thought
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.260]   we were definitely getting married.
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:37:00.600]   They took purity from you and you still carry scars
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.160]   and pain when you think about them.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.660]   When you even hear their name.
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:08.000]   That all of us, as we look behind us,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.120]   who are the people that you're still carrying pain,
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.720]   that you haven't forgiven, and Jesus's invitation
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.460]   is to turn the other cheek, extend forgiveness.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.440]   You may need to leave tonight and go
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.400]   and one of the best things you can do
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.080]   for many of you who are carrying pain
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:27.320]   that is from past things done against you,
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.680]   you were the victim, is to go and get alone
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.880]   and begin to work through that forgiveness
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.100]   and here's what I mean by that.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.700]   To get alone, to write down the things
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.520]   that were hurt, that were taken from you,
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.840]   that were stolen from you.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.400]   Anytime there's sin, there's a debt created.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.500]   To write those things down, you took from me this.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:54.880]   And I'm choosing to forgive you, I'm canceling the debt.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.880]   Like God canceled my debt.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:02.660]   Despite how much it hurts and despite how hard it is,
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:07.780]   we sit down and begin to work through that pain.
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.220]   And the second group is some of you may need
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.440]   to just call and ask for forgiveness
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.180]   or meet up with and ask for forgiveness.
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:18.500]   Probably the most healthy habit you can now develop
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:21.500]   as you date someone is to begin the process
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.220]   of like anytime you think I hurt someone
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.860]   or you know you hurt, you call and you say,
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:25.880]   will you forgive me?
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.540]   And you very specifically say,
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.100]   for hurting you when I did X.
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.420]   Maybe you just, you told a girl you were gonna call her back
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.260]   and you didn't call and you need to call and say,
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.940]   will you please forgive me, that was wrong.
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.880]   And I lied to you, will you forgive me?
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:45.300]   Or across the board, things maybe that much,
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.180]   at a much deeper level, you need to call and say,
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.480]   will you forgive me?
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:53.640]   And ask for forgiveness, seeking reconciliation
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.840]   with that other person.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:58.380]   And as you prepare, I mean, this is like
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.980]   the biggest determiner for marriage.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.820]   And because every day there's a hurt.
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:07.060]   My wife and I have conflict only like one time a day.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.460]   And when that happens, it happened today,
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:11.460]   will you forgive me?
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:15.700]   And as you begin to develop that habit right now,
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.300]   so asking forgiveness and extending forgiveness
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:21.520]   or canceling the debt, I'm not gonna hold this against you.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:26.200]   How do we respond to those who harm us, we forgive.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:30.680]   How do Christians respond to those who hate them, we love.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:37.600]   Our response is God's response to us, to everyone.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:42.000]   That's what we're to do, respond in the same way
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.960]   that God responded to us.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.960]   I had to do that first step personally,
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:55.080]   a few years back when I was in school
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.560]   and I had to just work through the process
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.600]   of forgiving someone.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:02.480]   I realized I was carrying pain from my father.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.880]   And my dad, and just for whatever reason,
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.600]   I was at A&M, woo, and I beat you to it.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.480]   And I was there and I just realized I just had some pain,
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.240]   I was carrying around from my past.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:21.760]   My dad, I was raised almost exclusively by a single mother
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.820]   and had struggled with alcoholism as long as I know.
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:28.160]   Is to the best of my knowledge, not a believer.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:32.760]   And he was never around, I have very few memories
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.260]   of him being around and the ones I do aren't good.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.760]   Abusive to my mom.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.360]   And I realized there came a day
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.080]   where I just had to deal with that, I'd never forgiven him,
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.320]   I'd never taken that step.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.680]   And I don't even know that I would've been like,
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.760]   yeah, I'm holding a grudge, I'm holding this,
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.760]   I'm not letting it go.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.460]   I think it just, I began to realize I've never forgiven him.
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:58.180]   And I began to sit down and I went and got away
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.400]   and I sat down and I began writing
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.340]   all the things that he had taken.
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:05.280]   They were sins ultimately against God,
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:09.680]   but as his son, they were hurts or things taken from me
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.680]   and I began to write down, you took from me.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:17.120]   You took from me a dad who was there.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.240]   You took from me the chance at a normal childhood.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.680]   You took from me Monday nights, every other Monday night
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:27.040]   where I had to drive across town to your terrible apartment
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.920]   because that's what the custody court ordered.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.580]   You took from me holidays where you were wasted.
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:39.180]   You took from me a chance to see someone love my mom.
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.500]   You took from me the example of a father.
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:47.920]   And I wrote them all down and at the end of the list,
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:53.100]   I said, I'm not holding those things against you.
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:56.140]   I'm canceling the debt like my debt has been canceled.
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.980]   Holding onto these will only hurt me
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:00.420]   and I'm making the decision,
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.260]   I'm not gonna hold those against you.
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:09.060]   And it wasn't easy, but there was this unbelievable feeling
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.700]   of freedom that came from the God who says, I love you
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.460]   and holding onto these things will only hurt you.
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:19.380]   I'm inviting you to forgive as you've been forgiven
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.240]   and I didn't do that because I'm a good person, I'm not.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.580]   I just came to the realization that
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.140]   if what Jesus says is true,
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.100]   if I've really been forgiven like that,
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.240]   how can I not forgive him?
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:36.460]   And I decided to cancel the debt
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.260]   and some of you may need to do that.
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.980]   Because you're holding onto things
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:43.620]   inside of your heart from hurts
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:45.520]   and things wrong that happened to you.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:52.260]   I love this message because
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.100]   what if the church got this?
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.580]   Like in Dallas and in Fort Worth,
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.700]   what if like every person in this room really did this?
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.300]   What if they really loved like this?
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.900]   Has there ever been a time in our nation's history
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.120]   in the last maybe few decades,
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.620]   arguably the civil rights era,
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:12.100]   where hatred was so common or hatred is so common?
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:16.180]   Bigotry is so common.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:17.860]   Racism.
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.500]   There's wounds all over our country
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.140]   and if there was ever a time where people in our nation
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.740]   needed to see a group of people
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.700]   who loved like their father in heaven,
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:29.660]   who said no matter what you do to me, I'm going to forgive.
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:33.580]   I'm making that decision like I've been forgiven.
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.720]   And that's how I'm gonna conduct my relationships.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.400]   Was there ever a time where people so desperately
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.360]   needed to encounter that kind of love?
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.960]   A love more powerful than hate, more powerful than racism,
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:50.140]   more powerful than the divides of how much money you make
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.440]   or the color of your skin?
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.160]   In the church, we have a chance to do that now
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.440]   and you and I get to do that.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:00.720]   And when we do so, individually, it will change your world.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.280]   It will.
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:07.440]   And if we do it, it will change this world.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.100]   If you're not a Christian,
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:13.820]   this message really isn't for you.
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:19.380]   But Jesus is and forgiveness is.
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.980]   And as we just work through those pains tonight,
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:24.520]   if you don't know the God who forgave you,
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.680]   I don't know honestly what to tell you.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:31.560]   Because it's only in the shadow of the cross
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.560]   that I'm able to forgive.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:36.680]   Like if I just look in the shadow of my pain against my dad,
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.060]   I'm not able to forgive.
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.480]   But in the shadow of that cross,
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:44.000]   all that I'm doing is extending forgiveness
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.400]   like I always extended.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.280]   And that's what he invites us to.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.320]   And if you don't know that God,
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.560]   we'd love to invite and talk to you about that.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.720]   And if you do, we'd love to call and invite you
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.960]   to go extend and ask for forgiveness.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.400]   I'm gonna pray that we would.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:02.400]   Father, thank you that you are the God
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:07.400]   who washes the feet, metaphorically,
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.880]   of us in the room and actually
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.320]   of those men in that room 2,000 years ago,
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.780]   including one who you knew would betray you.
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.880]   Thank you that you're the God who dies on a cross,
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.900]   who loves your enemies like me
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.100]   and through your love changes us.
[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:27.920]   Would you make us more like our Father in heaven,
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.160]   more like Stephen?
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.680]   I pray for hurts in the room that are deep,
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.680]   even ones that maybe have been offended
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.640]   or felt like I was belittling pain
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:40.960]   through just things that I said,
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.300]   of calling them to forgive.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:46.640]   Would you do what only you can do,
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.280]   move on their heart, move on all of our hearts
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.720]   to seek forgiveness and ask for it where we need to
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:53.640]   and extend it.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.680]   And I pray for those who don't know you,
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:00.000]   that they would experience your forgiveness tonight
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.080]   for the very first time. We love you.
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.720]   We thank you for Jesus, the man of sorrows,
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.800]   acquainted with grief, who died for all of us
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.400]   and gives us new life.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.680]   In his name we pray, amen.
