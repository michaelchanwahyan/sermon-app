[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Porch, how we doing? We doing okay?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   Hey, welcome to Porch Christmas. So glad that you're here.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.520]   Thankful that we've gotten to journey together all year long and we are bringing it home
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.680]   tonight. I love the fact that
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.560]   we're getting to kind of ring in the holiday at the beginning of December so we can really
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.000]   calibrate ourselves and get ourselves prepared for where we're going over the course of the next month as we step into Christmas.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.440]   So without further ado, I thought I would just start with a story
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.280]   as per usual. Well for some of you, the pressure is high this Christmas because
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:44.400]   you're going to be spending the holiday with your significant other's family for the very first time.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.940]   I remember when this happened for me. It was
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.760]   2017. Brooke and I were first married and I
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.360]   finally got the opportunity to bring in the holiday and celebrate with some Christmas spirit alongside my
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.640]   in-laws. And it was meaningful for me because of a couple of different reasons. Number one, because I had never been invited
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.320]   to celebrate the holiday with them. Not because they don't like me. We get along great.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.400]   They just have a rule in their family that you have to ring it to bring it.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.880]   Which meant that if you're so serious about your relationship, then you'll put your money where your mouth is.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.520]   And you'll put a rock on her finger. And then you get entry into the family festivities. Which by that point, I had done so.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.080]   It was also meaningful because the second reason was they take Christmas very, very seriously. Like some of your families,
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.160]   they care a lot about
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.040]   the holiday.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:48.160]   So much so that they gear up with all sorts of different traditions. Things like baking cookies every single year and stringing lights together and
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.560]   watching Christmas vacation. Anybody a fan in here of that one? And wearing matching Christmas pajamas.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.000]   I had never been a part of that, but now I have several sets of Christmas pajamas from years past.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.800]   Taking Christmas Eve and sitting by the fire, waking up in the morning and opening presents one
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.720]   by one
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.560]   by one. So we could see what everybody got. They take their Christmas traditions very
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   seriously. And I was all for it because I came from a family that was the exact same way.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.880]   But there was one tradition that stood out to me most of all. And it was this. On Christmas morning,
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.640]   before we did anything, before we opened any presents,
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.400]   before we we made our way to the stockings or we considered the rest of our day's plans,
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.360]   we read the Christmas story.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.080]   Not the one about Ralphie and the Red Ryder BB gun,
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.800]   but the one about Jesus. The fact that Christ in this season came and he came for you and
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.000]   me. You see, they knew what I knew and I'm praying you would know tonight.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.400]   That as wonderful as all the pageantry of Christmas is, the real wonder is found in the person of Christmas himself.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.720]   It's found in Jesus.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.640]   Now, why do I tell you all of this? Because some of you here are wondering why you haven't gotten an invitation to Christmas yet.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.920]   And the fact may be you haven't put a ring on it.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.240]   So you should make haste because that may be your entry to spending time with the family.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.480]   But also and more importantly than that,
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:27.480]   bigger than the festivities of the holiday, more than lights and baked goods and dinner with family and time by the fire
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.840]   and singing Christmas carols or whatever it may be for you.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.280]   There is something so significant in this season
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.160]   where the true wonder of the holiday lies in wait.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.400]   And that's what I want to talk to you about tonight.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.360]   That's what I want to help us find here at the beginning of this
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.200]   Christmas season. And the way that I want to do it is I want to look at the book of Philippians.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.360]   So if you have a Bible, you can turn there with me. The book of Philippians. Now you may be wondering
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.360]   why are we going to Philippians? This is not my normal place for a Christmas message.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.360]   Typically you would find yourself at the the front chapters of one of the Gospels.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.720]   Maybe one of the verses that you read at the beginning of the night in our opener.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.320]   But the reason we're looking at Philippians 2 is I think that therein lies the kind of wonder
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.080]   I really want us to get tonight. Because what we see is a
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.320]   perspective on Christmas
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.680]   that's not earthly,
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.280]   but is heavenly.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.680]   You see in Philippians 2 we get to stand and not from our vantage point here on planet Earth,
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.560]   but we get to stand from the vantage point of God himself in heaven as he thinks about this moment.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.040]   The moment that we've come to celebrate this month.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.080]   And what we know is that as we see through God's own eyes on this holiday,
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.480]   we'll find the reason that the season is so significant.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:56.640]   Namely three reasons in specific. The first of which is this, that Jesus was born to reach a lost world.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.360]   Jesus was born to reach a lost world. That's what it says starting in verse 6. Verse 6 says,
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.360]   "Who, though he was in the form of God,
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.000]   did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.560]   But he emptied himself by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men."
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.160]   Now, I want you to stop where you are and just think about this for a minute.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.280]   Like this statement is telling us something about the nature of who Jesus is.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.840]   Actually, it's telling us the fundamental nature of who Jesus is.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:32.600]   So the same way that if Jesus were to wear a letter jacket, all the patches on his arms, they would detail
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.720]   characteristics about who he is. That he's a friend of sinners, and he went all state in miracle making,
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:46.080]   and he was first team when it came to saving the world. Like he would have patches lined along his arms that detail
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.360]   these different
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.400]   characteristics of who he is. And yet most fundamental to who he is, that identifier which you would find on the back of his
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   jacket would be "Son of God."
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.360]   Because that is the name that is most fundamental to who Christ is.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.160]   Like when he says he's in the form of God,
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.600]   it's not saying that he looks like God. It's not saying that he's a substitute. He's a nice alternative.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.280]   It's saying that he's actually God. You get that?
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:20.400]   And if we gathered here, and you heard that news, that would be good enough reason for us to get in this room together tonight.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.840]   Because that is amazing. Like if you want to find the wonder of the holiday,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:31.720]   what's more wonderful than that? Than this idea that a God in heaven became a man here on this earth.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.840]   Like that is jaw-dropping. That's awe-inspiring.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:42.440]   That's wonderful beyond measure. And yet Paul, as he writes through this, he doesn't just stop there.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.280]   Like what we know is he goes on to tell us that
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.960]   he was in the form of God, and yet he emptied himself.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.480]   Because he did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped. That word "grasped" in
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.280]   the original language, it's the idea of seizing something or taking something by force.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:12.560]   So just to get some perspective, what Jesus is saying here is, is I, as Jesus Christ, am the most powerful being in the
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.240]   world, in all creation, and yet I'm not on a power trip.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.840]   Like I'm not looking out for myself.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:26.000]   I'm actually willing to lay aside my sovereignty, punt on my privileges, give up my glory,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.560]   because I'm not thinking about me. I'm thinking about you. I'll do whatever it takes to get close to you, to help you.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.680]   Isaiah 53, 2 tells us,
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.600]   "He had no former majesty
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.560]   that we would look at him,
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.480]   no beauty that we should desire him."
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.640]   So this is a good, this is a good moment for me to introduce someone
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.560]   to the stage.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.640]   Porch, will y'all do a great job of helping me welcome my son Cash Levi to the platform?
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:05.760]   Let's see if we can find him. There he is.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:12.920]   Okay, he just spit up all over Brooke. That's good. I'm glad you emptied up before you got on stage, buddy.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.320]   All right, let's go. Mom, stay close.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.520]   Porch, meet little Cash.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:27.600]   Doning his very own Porch t-shirt, if you can see this. Cash, meet several thousand of your best friends.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.120]   When Cash was born,
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.200]   a couple of things struck me.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.680]   Number one, I
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.480]   was struck by how remarkable he is.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.080]   Remarkable in the sense that he's a true gift from God to us.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.760]   But I was also struck by the fact
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.160]   that he's pretty regular.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:58.160]   In the sense that he's just like me and he's just like you.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.960]   Jesus was the same way.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.880]   Jesus was remarkable, a gift from God.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:11.600]   And yet Jesus became regular, just like me and just like you.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.080]   Jesus
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:22.360]   was totally self-sufficient before he came to this earth. But when he came as a baby, he became like Cash.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.560]   And he needs his mommy and daddy for everything.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.760]   Jesus, before he came,
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.160]   was totally self-reliant.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.160]   And yet, like Cash,
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.840]   he relied upon others to meet his needs.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.800]   There was no aura about Jesus when he was here on this earth.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.480]   There was no halo over his head. If he had walked into this room tonight,
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.120]   he wouldn't have floated to his seat.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.760]   He would have looked
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.560]   just like you,
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.440]   just like me.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.440]   And he would have been like him.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.520]   Jesus came
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.160]   and he set aside his transcendence as
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.680]   God and he took upon dependence.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   Like a babe.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.560]   That's how badly Jesus wanted to reach you.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.840]   That's how badly Jesus wanted to reach me.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.640]   He was willing to become like us.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:31.760]   That's how far he would go. He didn't hedge his bets. He wasn't one foot in, one foot out.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.400]   He emptied himself completely.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.320]   Because he loves you.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.200]   It says that he's come not just to be a man, but to be a servant. Why a servant?
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.400]   Because he wants to help you.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.800]   He wants to help those that are helpless.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.200]   He wants to love those that are unlovely.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:11:01.080]   He wants to redeem those that feel beyond redemption and save those that think they cannot be saved.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.720]   That's how much Jesus in this season matters.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.200]   You've been very good.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.160]   Thank you. I'm so glad that you like those lights.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.160]   I'm gonna give you back to your mommy now.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:32.480]   Jesus was not just born to reach a lost world.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.080]   He was also born to rescue a broken people.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.480]   He was born to rescue a broken people.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.920]   That's what verse 8 tells us. Verse 8 says that in being found in human form,
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.800]   he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.600]   You see, that's the important part of Christmas. Like Jesus didn't just come to associate with you.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:59.160]   He came to liberate you. Like 2 Corinthians 8 and 9 says, "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.360]   he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that by his poverty
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:11.280]   you might become rich." Meaning Jesus didn't just come for you. You get that. Like he didn't just come to associate.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:18.000]   He came to change everything for you. He came to liberate you. Y'all know that movie, The Nightmare Before Christmas?
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.880]   That movie that can't make up its mind if it's Halloween or Christmas flick? Nightmare Before Christmas.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.640]   That's a pretty appropriate title for your story before Jesus ever entered in.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.840]   It was a nightmare. And yet Jesus came into your story not just to
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.640]   shine a light into the recesses of your soul and show you just how broken you are.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.880]   Not just to prove to you that you really are messed up, but you know what? Hey, what good luck.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.320]   You're gonna have to figure that out by yourself.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.520]   No, he came because he wanted to figure that out for you.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:50.600]   Like he stepped in to fix the most broken parts of who you are. To free you of your failures, to save you of your
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.760]   sins, to ultimately redeem you in your worst mistakes.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:00.320]   That's why he came. The birth of Christ that we celebrate at Christmas is Jesus looking upon your helpless estate and saying,
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.440]   "I can help!"
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.200]   Like you don't think that you have anyone who could help you in the most
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:11.120]   heart-wrenching places of your life and yet I can do it. If you need a liberator, I
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:17.920]   can liberate you. If you need a redeemer, I can redeem you. If you need a healer, I can heal you.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.040]   If you need a Savior, that's what I've come to do.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:26.280]   I have come willing to empty myself so that you might be filled up instead.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.840]   You see, Jesus
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.280]   he did the unthinkable.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.440]   He descended
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.880]   from God to man, to servant, to death,
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.680]   to even death on a cross, an
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.240]   infinite humiliation for the Son of God.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.680]   So that you might ascend
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.000]   from death
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.720]   to life,
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.920]   to child of God, to eternity with him forever.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.800]   I love the way CJ Mahaney says,
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.240]   "Christ bore it alone
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.040]   that we might not ever be alone."
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.400]   So what do you do when you know all of this?
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.320]   Once you know that Jesus was born to reach a lost world and rescue a broken people,
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.680]   you do what God does, which is where this
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.640]   passage ends in verses 9 through 11.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:33.680]   It says, "Therefore," because of all of this, because Jesus has been born to reach a lost world and to rescue a broken people,
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.440]   "Therefore God has highly exalted him.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:41.120]   He's bestowed on him the name that's above every name, so that at the name of Jesus
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:48.320]   every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father."
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.680]   You see, you remember who Jesus is. You see the life
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.440]   he lived, the lengths that he would go to get to you, and
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.360]   then you respond rightly.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.160]   How do you respond?
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.960]   With rejoicing.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.280]   You praise him because there's no one like him,
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.520]   because you know that Jesus was born to reign over
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.720]   everything.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.840]   He was born to reign over everything, and that includes you.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:21.840]   In theological circles, whenever you work through this section of Scripture,
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.920]   there are three terms used to describe
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.560]   the detail that Paul's unpacking.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.760]   The first is Christ's condescension,
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:37.520]   that he condescended, that he lowered himself from heaven to earth. The next is Christ's
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.320]   reconciliation, that he bore our shame in
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:48.280]   sin on the cross. And then the last is Christ's exaltation,
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.360]   that though he died,
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.520]   death could not keep him.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:16:00.160]   But he rose forth from the grave because he is who he says he is. He did what he said he would do.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.280]   He's not just a nice guy, a miracle worker, a helpful teacher.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:12.640]   He's God, and he conquered that unconquerable foe. He vanquished our very worst enemy.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.840]   He ultimately
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:20.600]   dominated that which was dominating you and condemning you to separation from him forever.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.640]   He took away your sin, and as he rose forth from the grave, he declared
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.360]   that I am who I say I am. I am king.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:35.400]   And he sits on his throne tonight.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.000]   He reigns over all tonight.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.760]   He rules over everything
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:48.520]   tonight. What does that mean, that he rules? We don't really use that kind of language.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.960]   Like you don't say like, "I rule over my cubicle."
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.520]   No one talks about
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.520]   their workspace like that.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.920]   You might look at someone and say, "You rule," but that's the closest thing we get.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:04.080]   So what does it mean when the scripture is telling us that he reigns, that he rules? It means he's not only all-powerful,
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:11.440]   it means he has the right to rule, and he has the right to rule
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.120]   because he is
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.800]   king.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.280]   And so some of you need to know tonight, like I don't know what the holidays hold.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.040]   I don't know what the month ahead has in store,
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.400]   but because Jesus reigns on his throne right now,
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   you have a reason for hope.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.200]   Because Jesus reigns on his throne right now,
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.280]   you have a reason for peace.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.440]   Because Jesus reigns on his throne right now,
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.640]   you have a reason for joy.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:48.080]   I remember
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.000]   just several years ago
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.440]   finding myself so excited because Christmas was coming.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.480]   Love this holiday, the chance to be with my family,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.640]   to sit by the table with my friends, to enjoy good food, to watch cheesy Hallmark movies, to sing those songs
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:12.360]   and avoid Mariah Carey at all costs. You know, I was just pumped, man. I love this season
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.080]   for all of these reasons, and yet what I realized
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.120]   is that that name,
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.960]   which is at the center of the holiday, it didn't evoke within me
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.360]   the kind of wonder I wanted.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.200]   Maybe that's you here tonight.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:40.880]   What you need to know is that the name at the center of this holiday is that name which is above every name.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.880]   It's the name which every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess. He is Lord.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:52.800]   Both heaven on earth and under the earth. If you want to be reawakened to the wonder of
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.320]   Christmas,
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.720]   then you need look no further than the one
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.760]   that sought to reach a lost world,
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:06.800]   rescue a broken people, and today reigns over all things.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:11.160]   If you want to be reawakened to the wonder of Christmas,
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.080]   you need look no further
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.520]   than the one who came looking for you.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.760]   Let me pray for us.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.920]   God, we love you
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.000]   and thankful
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.520]   here God standing at the final Tuesday of this year
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.120]   knowing just how much God you've accomplished
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:41.720]   in the lives of very individual people from very different backgrounds with very broken and busted stories.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.440]   I'm so grateful God that
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:51.800]   you've given us the joy of being a part of that. So grateful God to you that here in this room
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.640]   we haven't just gathered because we want to be entertained,
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.040]   because we want to grow our intellect,
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:07.640]   because we want to meet new people. Yes, God, those are good reasons to gather, but God we have gathered here
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.800]   with the soul and singular purpose of
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   seeking you.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.480]   And in this season
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.880]   that's easy to do
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.040]   because we're reminded that you sought us
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.160]   first.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.840]   We love you.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.160]   And we sing to you now and we celebrate you Jesus,
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.640]   the one that would reach out
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:39.560]   to a lost people, would rescue us from the most broken parts of our story and would reign over us
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:46.280]   today, tomorrow, and forever for our good. We sing to you now in Jesus name we pray.
