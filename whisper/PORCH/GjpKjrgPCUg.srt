00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,460
 [VOCALIZING]

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:29,420
 Well, how we doing, Porsche Dallas?

4
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,420
 [CHEERING]

5
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,580
 I want to welcome you to the porch.

6
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,660
 My name is Josiah Jones.

7
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,900
 I have the privilege of being on staff here serving

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,940
 with the Young Adult Ministry.

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,560
 And if you're watching online, welcome to the porch.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,140
 And all of our Porch Live locations around the nation

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,580
 just placed in different places in our nation,

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,300
 whether that be Porch Live Des Moines, or Porch Live Boise,

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,780
 Porch Live Scottsdale, Dayton, Ohio, Porch Live Atlanta,

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,320
 and a whole host of other Porch Live locations.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,540
 Can you help us welcome them?

16
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,780
 Yeah.

17
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,420
 You picked a really good time to be here at the porch.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,620
 And we're really excited about what God's going to do tonight.

19
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,260
 And before I get going and introduce our guest speaker,

20
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,140
 I just want to say thank you for joining us here

21
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:16,900
 on a Tuesday night.

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,700
 We know you could be in a lot of different places in Dallas,

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,780
 but you're here.

24
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,480
 And I was having brunch earlier in the week,

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,800
 and I invited my waitress to the porch.

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,180
 And she said, oh, yeah, like the restaurant?

27
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,460
 And I said, no, no, no, no, not the restaurant,

28
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,620
 the young adult ministry.

29
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,780
 And so maybe you got kind of coming to the porch

30
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,460
 thinking it was the restaurant and bar,

31
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,340
 but you're here on a Tuesday night

32
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,540
 at Watermark Community Church.

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,820
 We're glad you're here.

34
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,220
 And so you're in for a real treat,

35
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,100
 because who I want to introduce you to is really

36
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,820
 near and dear to my faith.

37
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,100
 When I came to know Christ several years ago,

38
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,260
 this man was instrumental in my growth.

39
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,860
 And I found him through a podcast,

40
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,740
 through a friend who sent me a podcast.

41
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,700
 And then I read books about just the gospel of Jesus Christ

42
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,500
 in which he wrote.

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,620
 And this person that I'm talking about is Matt Chandler.

44
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,060
 And yeah, and you resonate with me

45
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,860
 when I say, hey, he was instrumental in my growth.

46
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,820
 You resonate with it, because the same is true for you.

47
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,520
 And so I remember picking up a book

48
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,460
 that he wrote in 2011 called "The Explicit Gospel," where

49
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,420
 it just gave me this robust, high view of who

50
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,540
 God is, the life, the death, the burial,

51
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,100
 and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

52
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,300
 And it just exploded.

53
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,220
 The gospel exploded off the pages in my mind and heart

54
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,580
 and just caused me to fall more in love with Christ.

55
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,820
 And then a year later, he wrote a book

56
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,700
 called "To Live is Christ and to Die is Game,"

57
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,660
 where he just walked us through the book of Philippians.

58
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,700
 And so if you still don't know who Matt Chandler is,

59
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,140
 he is a lead pastor at the Village Church in Flower Mound,

60
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,300
 Texas.

61
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,540
 And so he is here tonight to bring the word.

62
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,340
 And so before he comes up, I want

63
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,820
 to pray and thank God for him.

64
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,700
 And really, let me do that right now.

65
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,420
 Thank you, Matt, for the investment

66
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,580
 that you have made in the kingdom of God.

67
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,460
 Only heaven knows the fruit that has come out of his ministry

68
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,820
 and that continues to come out of his ministry

69
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,900
 through his faithfulness.

70
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,700
 So thank you, Matt.

71
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,820
 Let me pray.

72
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,180
 God in heaven, we are honored and humbled

73
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,860
 that you have brought Matt Chandler to the porch tonight.

74
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,100
 God, we know that you don't need us,

75
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,940
 but you choose to use us in spite of us

76
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,220
 to accomplish your purposes.

77
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,220
 And I'm thankful for the faith that you've

78
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,140
 given Matt and the way that he has leveraged

79
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,420
 his life to make you known.

80
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,640
 And God, I'm just excited about the word

81
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,460
 that you have for him tonight, that you would use him

82
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,020
 in a powerful way, that his voice would be your voice,

83
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:57,300
 that, God, your words would explode in our hearts.

84
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,900
 And God, we wouldn't see a mere man,

85
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,900
 but we would see straight through Matt to you.

86
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,940
 And God, it would cause us to have a deep faith in you

87
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,940
 as our Lord and Savior.

88
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,660
 And so God, use him in a powerful way tonight.

89
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,020
 And God, if there's people here that don't know you, God,

90
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,540
 may they come to know you as a result of tonight's service.

91
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,780
 We love you, and we thank you.

92
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,860
 It's in the holy and precious name of Jesus Christ

93
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,180
 I say all these things in.

94
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:25,900
 Amen.

95
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,940
 Give it up for Matt Chandler.

96
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,340
 Hey, it's good to see you.

97
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,580
 If you have your Bibles, go ahead and grab those.

98
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,140
 We're going to be in Job chapter 1.

99
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,900
 And I know you're thinking, not on a Tuesday, Matt.

100
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,860
 You're not doing Job on a Tuesday.

101
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,900
 You saved that for Sunday.

102
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,100
 And yet, I think there's something really beautiful

103
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,540
 about Job for you and for me.

104
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,860
 And so if you have your Bibles, go ahead and turn there.

105
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,300
 What I'm going to try to do in the next 35 minutes

106
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,540
 is preach through the book of Job.

107
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,500
 So that's really-- that's aspirational,

108
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,260
 and we'll see how it goes.

109
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,180
 When my oldest daughter, who's about--

110
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,900
 she's 20 now.

111
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,700
 She's not about 20.

112
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,380
 She is 20-- was about four or five years old.

113
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,100
 We were in our car, and we were heading to Possum Kingdom Lake

114
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,020
 for a little rest.

115
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,860
 Apparently, that committee up there

116
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,380
 didn't get to vote on what to call the lake,

117
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,820
 and they landed on Possum Kingdom Reservoir.

118
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,620
 And so we were heading out to Possum Kingdom,

119
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,340
 and Audrey, she had several days earlier been bitten by something

120
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,220
 and had like a bug bite on her leg.

121
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,820
 And so it was bothering her.

122
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,780
 She was scratching it.

123
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,940
 And if you've been around kids, you've got to-- hey,

124
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,860
 don't scratch that.

125
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,740
 But you wouldn't be able to stop scratching it,

126
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,940
 and so you're trying to explain to a four-year-old mind,

127
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,860
 I know that feels good.

128
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,820
 You're making it worse.

129
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,500
 But she was alone, and she just kept itching at it.

130
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,460
 And then we stopped for gas.

131
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,340
 And my in-laws were coming with us.

132
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,300
 That's not a bad thing.

133
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,020
 I really like my in-laws.

134
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,740
 Like, jackpot on the in-laws, right?

135
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,220
 My father-in-law's given name is Johnny Walker.

136
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,100
 He played tailback at Southern Miss.

137
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,100
 I mean, that's like jackpot-level stuff.

138
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,100
 And we're getting gas, and my mother-in-law

139
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,740
 comes to the car, as mother-in-laws do

140
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,980
 when you have grandchildren.

141
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,740
 And Audrey rolled down the window quickly,

142
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,020
 because this usually, for Audrey, means whatever she wants.

143
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,820
 And so she rolls down the window and says hi to Mimi,

144
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,620
 and then begins to explain to Mimi that her leg hurt

145
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,100
 and that something bit her.

146
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,580
 My mother-in-law, who's a very intelligent-- despite this

147
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,940
 story, my mother-in-law is a very intelligent woman,

148
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,180
 raised two God-fearing young adults, one of whom

149
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,740
 I am madly in love with, looked at my little four-year-old

150
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,900
 daughter's leg and said, oh, that looks like a boil.

151
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,620
 I hope they don't have to lance that.

152
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,500
 No, we're fine.

153
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,340
 My daughter's four.

154
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,140
 What does she know about lancing stuff?

155
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,860
 So she asked, what is that?

156
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,860
 And this woman, who raised two God-fearing, well-adjusted,

157
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,460
 successful adults, said to my four-year-old daughter,

158
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,660
 it's where they take a lance, a scalpel,

159
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,300
 and they cut it open to let the poison out.

160
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,780
 Now, I don't know how well-adjusted

161
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,940
 the four-year-olds you've been around are,

162
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,300
 but mine has a lot of Chandler in her,

163
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,940
 which makes her frenetic with energy, passionate in desire,

164
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,660
 and stubborn in will.

165
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,260
 And so for the next two hours, I can't get the radio loud

166
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,020
 enough to cover up Audrey's screams of,

167
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,500
 I don't want him to cut my leg.

168
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,860
 I don't want him to cut my leg.

169
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,180
 I don't want him to cut my leg.

170
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,100
 And I'm smart enough now at the age of four for her to not go,

171
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,980
 oh, baby, they're not going to cut your leg,

172
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,260
 because they might.

173
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,540
 And I'm trying not to be a liar as best you can with kids.

174
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,100
 And so by the time we get to Possum Kingdom,

175
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,460
 and really by the next day, it's obvious that this is a boil.

176
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,540
 It has grown.

177
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,260
 Her leg is hot to the touch.

178
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,420
 And so we go to the hospital and/or vet in Mineral Wells.

179
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,700
 And I think it was both.

180
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,900
 I'm not sure.

181
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,380
 And we take Audrey in.

182
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,340
 And the nurses come in, and they check her out.

183
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,740
 And if I offended one of you from Mineral Wells, I'm sorry.

184
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,940
 It was confusing.

185
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,700
 And this internist, he's innocent.

186
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,820
 I mean, he knows nothing of my mother-in-law's

187
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,500
 medical explanation to my four-year-old, walks in,

188
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,100
 and he doesn't hardly-- he's in the room for like three

189
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,300
 seconds, and he just looks at it, and he touches it.

190
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,620
 And he says out loud, yeah, that's a boil.

191
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,020
 We're going to need to lance it.

192
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,100
 Now, at that moment, my four-year-old daughter

193
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:44,660
 somehow developed the strength of 1,000 sons.

194
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,620
 And there aren't enough nurses in the state of Texas

195
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,940
 to pin that little girl down so they could

196
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,940
 numb her leg and lance it.

197
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,500
 And so she's like throwing nurses against the wall.

198
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,700
 And finally-- that's hyperbole.

199
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,380
 And the doctor, this punk kid internist, looks at me

200
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,260
 and enlists my help.

201
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,660
 Dad, I don't know where Lauren went.

202
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,820
 Like, where did Lauren go?

203
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,460
 Where'd my wife go?

204
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,140
 She knew this.

205
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,420
 So I had to crawl on this bed, use my forearm

206
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,660
 to pin my little girl down to the bed,

207
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,780
 with tears streaming down her face, eyes of fire and betrayal

208
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,860
 penetrating my soul.

209
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,500
 I'm trying not to cry.

210
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,020
 I feel like there has to be another way.

211
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,700
 And I have to pin her down until they put that lidocaine

212
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,900
 in her leg, and then they lance the boil, and they wrap it up.

213
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,820
 And she's in therapy right now, and she's doing fine.

214
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,780
 No, there was a--

215
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,500
 maybe that's true.

216
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:52,940
 But there was a moment on that hospital gurney

217
00:09:52,940 --> 00:10:00,540
 where I'm using my strength to let something painful happen

218
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,700
 to this little girl that the first time I ever held her,

219
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,580
 I felt I'm still really capable of violence.

220
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,380
 And I felt like in that moment, that

221
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,020
 might be the closest I'll ever get to understanding

222
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,580
 God and suffering.

223
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,180
 That might be the closest I ever get to understanding

224
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,580
 God and suffering.

225
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,300
 And so one of the reasons I love the Bible--

226
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,060
 I mean, I love the Bible.

227
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,180
 And you're probably like, yeah, that's

228
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,680
 going to be helpful for what you do.

229
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,860
 But I love the Bible.

230
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,740
 And one of the reasons--

231
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,480
 there's a lot of reasons I love the Bible.

232
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,540
 But for the purpose of our 35-minute tour

233
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,300
 through the book of Job, I love the Bible

234
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,780
 because it's a grimy book.

235
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,220
 The Bible never paints a picture of reality that's

236
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,140
 inconsistent with our lives.

237
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,860
 It never does.

238
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,580
 It is a grimy-- it is not a children's book.

239
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,660
 In fact, to try to make it a children's book

240
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,900
 makes you skip over certain stories

241
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,540
 that there's no childlike way to tell the story.

242
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,660
 It is a-- like, every bit of pain, hardship, trauma, loss,

243
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,980
 disappointment, disease, death, crisis, tragedy imaginable

244
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,540
 is in the book.

245
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,580
 Like, if this is meant to manipulate people,

246
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,880
 it is a terrible work of propaganda.

247
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,500
 It is grimy from beginning to end.

248
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,860
 Genesis-- it is a grimy, grimy book.

249
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,200
 It's like the Bible wants us to know.

250
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,660
 The God of the Bible wants us to know that suffering

251
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,260
 is going to be normal, that disappointment

252
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:35,540
 is going to follow us, that confusion and disorientation

253
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,820
 around certain realities of life in a fallen world

254
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,420
 should be expected among His people.

255
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,540
 Now, what's difficult in 2023, and maybe what's

256
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,940
 been difficult for the last 20 years,

257
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,900
 is that you and I are in this really

258
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,660
 odd moment in human history.

259
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,660
 And if you've got any kind of education in regards

260
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,220
 to history or sociology, you know some of this is true.

261
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,260
 Like, we live in this tiny little window,

262
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,580
 and the first window that's really ever existed,

263
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,500
 where we are shoveling the idea that everyone's reality should

264
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,320
 be one of chipper gladness and ever-increasing happiness

265
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,580
 with very little confusion and disappointment.

266
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,660
 And what sociologists are now finding--

267
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,540
 not Christian sociologists--

268
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,940
 they're finding this idea of perpetual happiness,

269
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,780
 like up and to the right life, is actually

270
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,940
 doing a lot of damage to our souls.

271
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,380
 Because look at me.

272
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,860
 That's no one's life, regardless of what they're

273
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,300
 taking pictures of and posting.

274
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,660
 So there are all these popular-level books being

275
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,140
 launched out of this research.

276
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,660
 One of the oldest ones is a book called

277
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,940
 Amusing Ourselves to Death, which I just like the title.

278
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,820
 Some of the newer ones, The Happiness Trap.

279
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,660
 Anybody pick up The Happiness Trap?

280
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,900
 I mean, that just kind of shows you where we are.

281
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,820
 Nobody's picking up The Happiness Trap.

282
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
 We want to, like, give it-- show me the happiness.

283
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,700
 Or Anti-Fragile, The Coddling of the American Mind,

284
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,780
 most recently Lost Connections.

285
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,340
 All of these books are saying the idea that suffering

286
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,940
 is abnormal and happiness is every day of our lives--

287
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,140
 and it's always up and to the right-- is absurd.

288
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,220
 And the more you actually believe and think that's going

289
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,140
 to be your life, the more anxious, the more depressed,

290
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,580
 and the more hopeless you will grow.

291
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,100
 In enters the book of Job.

292
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,420
 Well, let me start here.

293
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,020
 Let me explain Job.

294
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,980
 It's just a bad book to put in the Bible,

295
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,980
 I think, if you're trying to win converts.

296
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,660
 Now, it's probably a great book if you're trying

297
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,220
 to dial people into reality.

298
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,860
 In the middle of the Bible, there are these four books.

299
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,220
 They're called the Wisdom Literature, right?

300
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,420
 They're like, this is how life works.

301
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,140
 This is how human flourishing works.

302
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,380
 And there are these two books in the Wisdom Literature.

303
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,620
 They're telling the same story, but they're telling it

304
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,620
 from a different vantage point, right?

305
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,620
 One of those books is Ecclesiastes,

306
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,780
 another chipper little book in the middle of your Bible.

307
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,540
 And so what happens in the book of Ecclesiastes

308
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,500
 is Solomon wants to test if there's anything worth having

309
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,260
 under the sun, and he goes hard at it.

310
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,100
 He's a king.

311
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,180
 He's the wealthiest man on earth.

312
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,300
 He makes Bezos look broke.

313
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,540
 I mean, this guy's got, not only does he have cheddar,

314
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,740
 but he's got power.

315
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,780
 He's a king.

316
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,820
 There's no Senate.

317
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,020
 He can do what he wants, and he has enough cash

318
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,260
 to make it happen.

319
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,220
 And the book of Ecclesiastes tells us

320
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,220
 it goes something like this,

321
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,100
 that he starts out like most young men do

322
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,580
 in the party scene.

323
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,020
 And so he throws a party,

324
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,260
 and here's what he found out about parties.

325
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,500
 They're fun, right?

326
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,340
 That's what he says.

327
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,460
 He's just like, you know what I found out about partying?

328
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,260
 It's actually a pretty good time.

329
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,540
 And so he gives himself, and he parties, man.

330
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,380
 He goes pretty good.

331
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,580
 And about two or three, four or five months in,

332
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,140
 we don't know the timeframe,

333
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,300
 he starts going, this party's kind of lame.

334
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,420
 So does he quit partying?

335
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,260
 Oh no, man.

336
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,140
 No, he ratchets it up.

337
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,060
 He's like, we're gonna throw a bigger party tonight.

338
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,180
 And he brings live music.

339
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,100
 Get rid of that DJ.

340
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,020
 We're going live music, live band.

341
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,900
 More barrels of wine, all right?

342
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,860
 More food, more.

343
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,300
 And he throws a bigger party,

344
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,740
 and he goes hard for another year, another two years.

345
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,740
 And he goes and tells them, man, this party is lame.

346
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,420
 And so then he goes even bigger,

347
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,420
 and you can find a list of just what he was barbecuing

348
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,420
 at these parties.

349
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,500
 Something like 200 head of cattle,

350
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,940
 like 400 birds, like 400 chickens, man.

351
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,260
 Like, I don't know if you've ever been to a barbecue.

352
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,100
 You ain't been to a barbecue like that.

353
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,060
 I know you got your little Labor Day thing you do,

354
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,460
 but this is something different.

355
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,140
 I mean, this man goes hard.

356
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,220
 He goes so hard that he can't go harder.

357
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,300
 And he wakes up in the back of an El Camino

358
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,180
 with a new tattoo.

359
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,740
 He has no memory of what just happened.

360
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,300
 He's got to figure out how to get back to Jerusalem.

361
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,820
 And maybe that's a prophetic word for one of you.

362
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,060
 And then he gets back to Jerusalem,

363
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,300
 and here's what he's like, it's not gonna work.

364
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,100
 This party scene is not going to work.

365
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,100
 And so then from the party scene, he moves to business.

366
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,860
 If party isn't gonna do it,

367
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,820
 then I'm gonna build an empire.

368
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,860
 And so he plants vineyards, and he builds cities,

369
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,860
 and he is wildly successful.

370
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,380
 If you went to Jerusalem to this day and went east,

371
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,860
 you would find these craters called the Pools of Solomon.

372
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,980
 And they are there

373
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,660
 because he planted full forests and vineyards.

374
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,180
 And so I know you put that little crate myrtle

375
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,460
 out on your balcony.

376
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,460
 This is something different than that.

377
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,300
 And he got to the place

378
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,460
 where he couldn't be more successful,

379
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,100
 that the neighborhoods he built

380
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,620
 and the companies he had acquired

381
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,980
 and the vineyards he had planted

382
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,580
 and the forest that he had made,

383
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,700
 there just wasn't anything bigger.

384
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,580
 And he said, "Dang it, this is worthless too."

385
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,380
 In fact, the refrain of the book of Ecclesiastes

386
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,220
 is vanity is vanity, all is vanity,

387
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,540
 or meaningless, meaningless, all is meaningless.

388
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,020
 Brother just needs a hug.

389
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,740
 So he starts in the party scene and it doesn't work.

390
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,740
 So then he moves to the big,

391
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,020
 builds an empire for himself.

392
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,580
 So he can't build it any bigger and it doesn't work.

393
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,780
 So then he moves over to pleasure.

394
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,180
 Normally in 2023, we like to pair up that pleasure

395
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,740
 with our party phase, but he waits.

396
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,460
 He's kind of a tycoon now.

397
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:18,460
 So he goes pleasure and he does not hold back on pleasure.

398
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,960
 There's not body type, position, or experience

399
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,860
 that he doesn't give himself over to.

400
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,340
 And guess what he said about it?

401
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,700
 "That was awesome until it wasn't."

402
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,860
 And then vanity of vanity, all is vanity.

403
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,940
 And then he gave himself over to what he just calls leisure

404
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,640
 or what we would call self-care.

405
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,060
 Gives himself over to self-care.

406
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,500
 He just goes out to the ranch.

407
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,940
 He's getting a massage, got a chef cooking meals.

408
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,780
 He just doesn't do anything.

409
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,420
 He just gives himself over to a life of leisure and says,

410
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,580
 "This isn't working either."

411
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,660
 And so Solomon exists because you and I

412
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,300
 will find ourselves stuck on a treadmill

413
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,760
 'cause we can't get that level of success.

414
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,260
 We are never gonna have that level of money.

415
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,340
 I'm not gonna have that level of power,

416
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,820
 even if you do have that level of money.

417
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,720
 So Solomon's there going, "Done it, it ain't gonna work.

418
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,020
 That party scene, I've been all the way to the end.

419
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,740
 It's just gonna leave you with a lot of regret

420
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,580
 and a broken heart.

421
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,620
 Hey, I built an empire, it's not gonna deliver.

422
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,820
 Hey man, I gave myself to that wildness

423
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,460
 and let me tell you what I got from it.

424
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,940
 Nothing, pleasure in the moment, regret after it's over.

425
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,020
 And then I just gave myself,

426
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,940
 or you know what I really wanna do?

427
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,300
 I just want cucumbers on my eyes.

428
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,420
 I don't want anybody to talk to me.

429
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,900
 And I did that and it's meaningless.

430
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,820
 There is nothing under the sun

431
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,440
 that will satisfy the souls of man.

432
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,220
 Then there's Job.

433
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:44,220
 Job doesn't gain everything and find out God is enough.

434
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,220
 Job loses everything and finds out God is enough.

435
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,780
 Now this is important because you and I

436
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,160
 are stuck between these two brothers.

437
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,740
 I'm not saying you hadn't suffered.

438
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,900
 I'm saying you hadn't suffered like Job.

439
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,580
 And I'm not saying you hadn't been successful.

440
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,300
 I'm saying you can't be as successful as Solomon.

441
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,020
 Which means you and I are stuck between these two men

442
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,060
 and we don't have to follow their trails

443
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,500
 because they're telling us guys,

444
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,100
 "Hey, it's not gonna work and he's enough."

445
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,460
 They're both saying he's enough

446
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,220
 from a different direction.

447
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,860
 And with that said, let's read the book of Job.

448
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,680
 Not the whole thing.

449
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,600
 Let's start in 1.1.

450
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,140
 There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job.

451
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,620
 And that man was blameless and upright,

452
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,340
 one who feared God and turned away from evil.

453
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,300
 So I just wanna stop.

454
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,340
 And you're like, this is gonna take forever.

455
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,980
 No, trust me.

456
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,340
 Like Job's a good man.

457
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,620
 Like he's an upright man.

458
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,220
 He's a good husband.

459
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,900
 He never swindled anyone out of money.

460
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,620
 He is a respected man.

461
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,740
 He works hard.

462
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,580
 He loves his wife.

463
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,420
 He's good to his kids.

464
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,360
 He's a good, upright man.

465
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,780
 That's what the Bible says.

466
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,400
 And then from there, this book takes this really weird turn

467
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,420
 where God's on his throne

468
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,580
 and the angels are presenting themselves before God

469
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,380
 and Satan comes in.

470
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,340
 And God says, "What have you been up to?"

471
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,500
 And Satan says, "Ah, perusing the sons of men."

472
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,860
 And God says, "You consider my God Job?

473
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,980
 "My God Job loves me.

474
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,340
 "He's upright, he's righteous.

475
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,700
 "Oh, please.

476
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,560
 "Like you've blessed him with every,

477
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,660
 "like he's one of the wealthiest men on earth.

478
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,040
 "He got like a billion kids.

479
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,340
 "I got a wife, he got respect.

480
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,180
 "But if you let me take all his stuff,

481
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,420
 "he'll curse your name."

482
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:30,860
 And God sets parameters.

483
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,980
 Don't touch his body.

484
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,260
 Don't kill him.

485
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,900
 Take his stuff.

486
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,100
 And here's where we pick up the story again.

487
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,240
 Now, there was a day when his sons and his daughters

488
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,900
 were eating and drinking wine

489
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,900
 in their oldest brother's house.

490
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,220
 And there came a messenger to Job and said,

491
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,700
 "The oxen were plowing

492
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,900
 "and the donkeys feeding beside them.

493
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,680
 "And the Sabians fell upon them and took them

494
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,320
 "and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword.

495
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,980
 "And I alone have escaped to tell you."

496
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,500
 And when he was yet speaking,

497
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,900
 there came another and said,

498
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,700
 "The fire of God fell from heaven

499
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,920
 "and burned up the sheep and the servants

500
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,180
 "and consumed them.

501
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,260
 "And I alone have escaped to tell you."

502
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,580
 And while he was yet speaking,

503
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,300
 there came another and said,

504
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,900
 "The Chaldeans formed three groups

505
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,140
 "and made a raid on the camels and took them

506
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,300
 "and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword.

507
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,180
 "And I alone have escaped to tell you."

508
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,860
 And while he was yet speaking,

509
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,820
 there came another and said,

510
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,900
 "Your sons and your daughters were eating

511
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,360
 "and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house.

512
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,740
 "And behold, a great wind came across the wilderness

513
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,180
 "and struck the four corners of the house

514
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,860
 "and it fell upon the young people and they are dead.

515
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,700
 "And I alone have escaped to tell you."

516
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,220
 Then Job arose and he tore his robe

517
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,940
 and he shaved his head and he fell on the ground

518
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,380
 and worshiped.

519
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,780
 And he said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb

520
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,620
 "and naked shall I return.

521
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,160
 "The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away.

522
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,260
 "Blessed be the name of the Lord."

523
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,500
 And in all of this, Job did not sin

524
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,300
 or charge God with wrong.

525
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,060
 I would like to just state the obvious.

526
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,900
 Job is better than we are.

527
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,580
 I made some charges against God

528
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,860
 just trying to get here to preach this thing

529
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,980
 coming down 35 to 635.

530
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,060
 I make charges against people in the left lane

531
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,180
 who are going the speed limit.

532
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,260
 I just have a problem with that

533
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,980
 and I think the Lord probably has a problem with that.

534
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,940
 And so I was asking the Lord for justice.

535
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,260
 He's a better man than we are.

536
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,060
 And then what happens is the scene shifts back

537
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,340
 to God's throne room and God is in his throne

538
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,580
 and here are the angels again and here comes Satan

539
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,980
 and God boasts on Job to Satan.

540
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,820
 He's like, "Hey, Satan, you hear that?

541
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,980
 "Blessed be the name of the Lord."

542
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,040
 You hear, "Oh my gosh, is that Job?

543
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,620
 "That's Job?

544
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,580
 "Did you take all his stuff?

545
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,700
 "You did take all."

546
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,780
 You hear, "He gives and takes."

547
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,940
 That's about me.

548
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,340
 He's singing about me.

549
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,380
 And then Satan fires back.

550
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,620
 That's because he has his strength.

551
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,900
 Let me take his strength and he'll curse your name.

552
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,300
 God sets parameters again.

553
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,640
 You can inflict him.

554
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,020
 You cannot kill him.

555
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,860
 And we pick up the story again.

556
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,060
 So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord

557
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,340
 and struck Job with loathsome sores

558
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,660
 from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.

559
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,640
 And he took a piece of broken pottery

560
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,540
 with which to scrape himself while he sat in the ashes.

561
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,980
 And then his wife said to him, "Ladies, don't do this.

562
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,020
 "Do you still hold fast to your integrity?

563
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,100
 "Curse God and die."

564
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,580
 But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women

565
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,500
 "would speak."

566
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
 Husbands, I wouldn't do that.

567
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,240
 Shall we receive good from God

568
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,540
 and shall we not receive evil?

569
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,440
 And in all of this, Job did not sin with his lips.

570
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,140
 Now, what happens next is Job's friends.

571
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,140
 Everybody hears about this, right?

572
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,760
 This is a famous, wealthy tycoon of a man

573
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,580
 who's highly regarded.

574
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,740
 It's clear that he's favored by God.

575
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,820
 And his close friends come.

576
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,700
 And when they see him, they weep.

577
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,460
 And no one says a word for seven days.

578
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,060
 All they do is they see him, they're heartbroken.

579
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,260
 They don't tell him that all things work together

580
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,100
 for the good of those who are called by God

581
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,160
 according to his purposes.

582
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,500
 They just see him and their heart breaks

583
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,660
 and they weep for seven days.

584
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,420
 And if that's all they would have done,

585
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,100
 we would know their names and we would celebrate them

586
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,820
 for being an example of what to do when it hurts.

587
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,900
 But unfortunately, they opened their mouths.

588
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,980
 The next major section of the book of Job,

589
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:56,700
 you won't read it, are his friends giving him advice,

590
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,420
 telling him and trying to explain to him

591
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,260
 why these things have happened to him.

592
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,420
 And what I think they, what I'm gonna argue they represent

593
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,500
 is they represent what happens when we suffer,

594
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,660
 when we're disappointed, when we're confused,

595
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,020
 when we're disoriented, when it's happened to us,

596
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,700
 or when it's happened to somebody we love,

597
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,260
 when we don't understand, when we're disoriented,

598
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,140
 what happens when you look around, right?

599
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,020
 So you're looking around, you're trying to figure out,

600
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,020
 what is, how do I make sense of this?

601
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,380
 I've heard that God is good.

602
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,900
 How do I make sense that this has happened to me,

603
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,500
 that this has happened to my friend,

604
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,860
 that this person I love,

605
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,180
 how do you make sense of this level of brokenness?

606
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,340
 And I think there are four things that can happen to us

607
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,340
 when we start looking around.

608
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,800
 And I think Job's friends represent those four things.

609
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,980
 Here's the first one.

610
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,980
 We can, if we're not careful in a world broken by sin,

611
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,100
 we can become fatalistic.

612
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,220
 Do you know what I mean by that?

613
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,060
 I'm gonna date myself.

614
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,900
 Maybe I will, maybe I won't, I don't know.

615
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,500
 You remember Ferris Bueller's day off?

616
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,020
 Cameron, remember Cameron?

617
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,100
 Like Cameron won't get out of bed.

618
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,980
 He's convinced he's gonna die.

619
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,300
 Why bother?

620
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,500
 And he won't, he didn't wanna do anything.

621
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,940
 So Ferris is trying to coax him out.

622
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,220
 He just doesn't wanna leave

623
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,140
 'cause he knows he's gonna be dead at any moment.

624
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,140
 So he didn't wanna try anything.

625
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,220
 He doesn't care about school.

626
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,140
 He doesn't care about college.

627
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,100
 Doesn't care about girls.

628
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,300
 Doesn't care about, he doesn't care about,

629
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,540
 'cause he's like already decided it's over.

630
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,260
 Well, one of the things that can happen to us as Christians

631
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,100
 if we're not careful,

632
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,940
 one of the things that can happen to you,

633
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,420
 maybe especially if you're not a Christian,

634
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,260
 is you can look around

635
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,260
 and you can develop a real fatalistic view of life.

636
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,460
 Like you can just decide

637
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,660
 that it's always gonna be bad for you,

638
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,420
 that it's never gonna work out for you,

639
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,140
 and you can become paralyzed

640
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,340
 and no longer live into your calling,

641
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,660
 live into your purpose.

642
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,260
 You just, and here's how I experience this

643
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,620
 as a pastor, a pastor of the same church for over 20 years.

644
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,780
 Some people will over identify with their suffering

645
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,900
 until they are that suffering.

646
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,300
 You tracking with me?

647
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,900
 Like they can't even, they're just the sick one,

648
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,020
 and the only way they know to relate to people

649
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,220
 is to be sick, and so they take it on as an identity.

650
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,260
 It's not something that's happened to them.

651
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,300
 It's not something that's part of a broken, fallen world.

652
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,520
 It's like who they are.

653
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,140
 So I'm the sick one.

654
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,060
 I'm the one that always has the migraines.

655
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,460
 I'm the one that can't get pregnant.

656
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,660
 I'm the one that's this.

657
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,060
 And they own it.

658
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,420
 They own the disease.

659
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,260
 They own the suffering as like their primary identity,

660
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:28,180
 and they stop even knowing how to relate to other people

661
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,340
 except through the disease,

662
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,860
 except through the suffering,

663
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,220
 except through the loss,

664
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,180
 except through the disappointment.

665
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,540
 They become jaded and fatalistic,

666
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,860
 and why bother?

667
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,940
 Why get out of bed?

668
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,300
 And that's one of the things that happens

669
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,580
 if you just start looking around

670
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,780
 to make sense of life in a sinful world.

671
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,100
 Another thing that can happen is actually quite Buddhist,

672
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,220
 and it's this idea that suffering isn't real.

673
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,940
 You just need to kind of detach.

674
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,100
 So kind of a popular level of Buddhist teaching

675
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,760
 is that suffering actually doesn't exist.

676
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,460
 You're just too attached,

677
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,380
 and if you would detach yourself

678
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,380
 from the things of this world,

679
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,020
 you would detach yourself from your stuff,

680
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,000
 you would detach yourself from relationships,

681
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,120
 you would detach yourself from the things of this world,

682
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,200
 you wouldn't be able to suffer

683
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,040
 because you couldn't lose anything

684
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,240
 because you've kind of reached divine detachment.

685
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,120
 Now, with no smoke towards the Buddhist,

686
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,200
 what a terrible way to live.

687
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,280
 Here's what I know.

688
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:36,400
 To be attached, biblically speaking,

689
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,560
 either in friendship or in marriage,

690
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,860
 puts you in harm's way.

691
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,440
 To love someone puts you in a dangerous spot.

692
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,480
 Do you know who I don't think can hurt me tonight?

693
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,320
 You.

694
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,720
 Like, I think when this is over, you'll be like,

695
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,560
 that guy's, I hate that guy.

696
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,680
 You can get it on Instagram.

697
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,320
 Lame.

698
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,760
 Study harder.

699
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,680
 And here's what I'm gonna do.

700
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,280
 I'm gonna show my wife, like, look at this guy.

701
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,600
 This guy lives crazy.

702
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,560
 Oh, you wanna see his profile?

703
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,160
 Yeah, look, no, he lives with his mom.

704
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,600
 Yeah, it's a, you know, it's like this.

705
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,880
 Like, I win.

706
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,040
 Yeah, I win.

707
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,920
 And I'm not, but you know who could absolutely destroy me?

708
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,520
 Lauren.

709
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,680
 I mean, oh my gosh, with just a sentence,

710
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,720
 she could kill me.

711
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,000
 And it's worth it.

712
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,760
 And some of you, I love you, you have made unholy vows

713
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,760
 that no one's ever gonna hurt you like that again.

714
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,080
 That you're never gonna allow anybody else

715
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,600
 to do that to you.

716
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,000
 And in so doing, you have closed yourself off.

717
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,560
 You have refused to be known.

718
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,980
 You have refused, in essence, to be loved again

719
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,680
 or to take the risk of loving another.

720
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,840
 I'm not talking about abuse.

721
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,640
 That's not, yeah, you make that vow.

722
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,600
 I'm not talking about that.

723
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,680
 I'm not talking about abuse.

724
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,560
 I'm not talking about that stuff.

725
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,040
 I'm talking about general relationships

726
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:06,040
 and letting people in, loving and being loved in return.

727
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,800
 The person who looks around goes,

728
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,400
 no, I'm not gonna let anybody hurt me like that again.

729
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,280
 I'm not gonna set myself up for that kind of disappointment.

730
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,680
 I'm not gonna take that risk.

731
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,600
 And we start to make what I'm,

732
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,720
 they're unholy vows.

733
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,760
 They're promises in relationship with evil spirits.

734
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,720
 That might be too much for you.

735
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,560
 I mean, you might be like me, Baptist background.

736
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,600
 You're like, evil spirit.

737
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,640
 Like it's what happens when you say,

738
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,840
 I won't, no one will ever do that to me again.

739
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,880
 I'm not talking about abuse.

740
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,240
 I'm talking about just being known and knowing.

741
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,200
 I'm talking about being loved and loving.

742
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,000
 Like no one gets to do that to me.

743
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,920
 You make this vow and then you build like armor around you

744
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,280
 so that nobody ever can.

745
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,160
 And you can build that with theology

746
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,720
 and you can build it with all sorts of

747
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,720
 kind of antisocial behavior,

748
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,240
 but you kind of build a wall around you

749
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,120
 and it's all for self-protection.

750
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,800
 And you grow increasingly jaded,

751
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,200
 increasingly angry, increasingly mean.

752
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,200
 And then gosh, in 2023, you get to brag about that.

753
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,360
 Right?

754
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,400
 It's just heartbreaking.

755
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,960
 It's one of the things that happens is we're just like,

756
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,080
 I'm gonna detach.

757
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,200
 I'm not gonna let anybody hurt me.

758
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,160
 I'm gonna live in such a way that nobody can hurt me.

759
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,080
 And I'm just telling you,

760
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,720
 all you're doing is emptying your life of meaning.

761
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,840
 The risk is worth it.

762
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,840
 And then the idea of karma, right?

763
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,280
 That what goes right, you know, like if I do good things,

764
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,120
 good things are gonna happen to me.

765
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,560
 If I do bad things, bad things are gonna happen to me.

766
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,360
 Like you don't actually want karma.

767
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,320
 Karma is a bad gig.

768
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,200
 Like what you want is grace.

769
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,240
 The promise of the gospel isn't karma,

770
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,400
 be good and I'll bless you.

771
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,120
 It's I've got good for you because of me.

772
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,160
 That's what you want.

773
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,760
 You want the grace of God in your life.

774
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,640
 And then lastly, if you're looking around,

775
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,080
 you're just gonna think that suffering's meaningless

776
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,920
 and random.

777
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,120
 And here's what's interesting about the book of Job.

778
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,120
 Job throughout the book,

779
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,800
 although the Bible says he does not sin in it.

780
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,440
 He's constantly, his friends are like,

781
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,280
 this is what happened.

782
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,160
 You know, if you were righteous,

783
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,000
 this wouldn't have happened to you.

784
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 He's like, that's not it.

785
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,960
 In fact, I wish the Lord would come down.

786
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,160
 I've got some questions for the Lord.

787
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,360
 I need the Lord to answer my, like I, I've served him well.

788
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,600
 I've praised his name.

789
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,360
 I've done good with my money.

790
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,280
 I loved my wife.

791
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,200
 I loved my kids.

792
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,680
 I did what he called me to do.

793
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,680
 How could this, I got questions for God.

794
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,840
 Why?

795
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,360
 How in the world am I supposed to move forward

796
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,080
 with him in light of this?

797
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,040
 And then it's like,

798
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,400
 here's what's fascinating about the book of Job.

799
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,280
 God never answers his question.

800
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:45,280
 It's almost as if the creator God of the universe,

801
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,280
 who's alpha and omega, he is outside of time.

802
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,720
 Are you tracking with me when I say that?

803
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,200
 It means the future isn't something he knows about.

804
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,720
 It's a place he is right now.

805
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,120
 Let that bend your brain a little bit, right?

806
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,120
 Like God's not a prophet per se.

807
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,320
 He's not like prophesying about the future.

808
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,760
 He's there right now in his fullness

809
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,520
 while being here with us right now in his fullness.

810
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,920
 He is outside of time.

811
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,640
 We are inside of time.

812
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,320
 He knows all things and how all things lead to other things,

813
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,480
 creating other things, moving other things

814
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,520
 that create other things without ever getting tired

815
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,320
 or having his brain seize up.

816
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,960
 How could we possibly comprehend

817
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,960
 life in a fallen world as limited as we are in our flesh?

818
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,600
 Augustine, who's my ancient friend,

819
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,040
 he described life in this world

820
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,640
 as having your face pressed up

821
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,200
 against a stained glass window.

822
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,280
 He's like, you're gonna see some colors.

823
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,720
 It's gonna look like things are broken

824
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,440
 and we just can't get far enough back

825
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,960
 to see that it makes something beautiful.

826
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,480
 And I'm telling you,

827
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,240
 I've been pastor in a church for 20 years.

828
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,200
 I know all the horrific things that can happen to people.

829
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,080
 And I think I understand what Augustine means

830
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,760
 that sometimes you look up and all you see

831
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,040
 is shattered glass, at least that's what it appears to us.

832
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,640
 And so it's as though God knows

833
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,600
 our brains are too small to comprehend

834
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,200
 that there's no way for us to possibly put

835
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,760
 all of that together as limited as we are in our flesh.

836
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,600
 He has always been and will always be.

837
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,200
 And we're like a half a second.

838
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,080
 We really are.

839
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,080
 Like, you know, the old adage,

840
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,200
 you're here today, gone tomorrow.

841
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,840
 You know, the Bible didn't even give you that.

842
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,920
 Bible's like here in the morning, gone by lunch.

843
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,080
 You're like the dew of the grass that's here in the morning

844
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,280
 and by afternoon is gone.

845
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,240
 So you're not even like here today, gone tomorrow.

846
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,640
 It's like you were there in the morning and by brunch,

847
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,480
 you're gone.

848
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,240
 And that verse is meant to orient us around God's godness

849
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,720
 as opposed to our frail humanity.

850
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,680
 So what God does do instead of explaining

851
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,880
 how this leads to this, that creates this,

852
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,720
 that brings this about, that does this,

853
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,060
 that creates this all the way down the line

854
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:10,060
 of human history, he says, quit looking around and look up.

855
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,240
 Stop looking around to make sense of all of this

856
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,360
 and get your eyes up on me.

857
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,240
 That's all he does with Job.

858
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,520
 Job finds like, I got questions.

859
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,240
 And God's like, I've got some questions.

860
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,480
 So how about you dress for action like a man

861
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,120
 and I'll ask you some questions.

862
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,040
 And really from Job 38, verse four,

863
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,800
 all the way to the end of the book,

864
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,160
 God just like starts asking Job questions.

865
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,520
 And here's just a little taste of it.

866
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
 I'm not gonna read all of that.

867
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,640
 Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?

868
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,440
 Tell me if you have understanding.

869
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,080
 Who determined its measurements?

870
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,540
 Surely you know.

871
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,560
 Or who stretched the line upon it?

872
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,960
 On what were its bases sunk?

873
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,640
 Or who laid its cornerstone

874
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,320
 when the morning stars sang together

875
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,760
 and the sons of God shouted for joy?

876
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,840
 I mean, we can just keep going.

877
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,560
 Or who shut in the sea with doors

878
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,040
 when it burst out from the womb?

879
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,840
 And I made the clouds its garment

880
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,720
 and thick darkness its swaddling band

881
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,640
 and prescribed limits for it and set bars and doors

882
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,040
 and said, thus far shall you come and no farther.

883
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,720
 And here shall your proud waves be stayed.

884
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,720
 Have you commanded the morning since your days began?

885
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,560
 And he goes on and on.

886
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,120
 And this might sound cruel,

887
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,180
 but what God is doing for Job

888
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:27,280
 is orienting him around God's power and God's goodness.

889
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,680
 Because here's what in the rest of the scriptures,

890
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,640
 here's how God kind of works when we look up.

891
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,000
 So let me give you just a couple of these.

892
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,880
 I don't have a ton of time left.

893
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,840
 Here are the promises of God when we look up

894
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,000
 rather than look around.

895
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,760
 So rather than being fatalistic,

896
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,200
 rather than just detaching,

897
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,240
 rather than armoring up,

898
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,820
 rather than just going, ah, it's inevitable,

899
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:51,040
 everybody suffers, is to look at these promises.

900
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,880
 Here's what we're promised,

901
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,680
 that Jesus is with us in the mess.

902
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,760
 Psalm 23,

903
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,460
 lo, though I walk through the valley

904
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,760
 of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.

905
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,880
 Why?

906
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,020
 For thou art with me.

907
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,300
 Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

908
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,000
 So what's the promise when we look up

909
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,520
 rather than look around and try to make sense

910
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,020
 of all of this?

911
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,300
 That Jesus will be near and that Jesus will comfort.

912
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,020
 We see in Hebrews chapter four

913
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,660
 that Jesus is an empathetic high priest.

914
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,660
 A good friend of mine says this verse like this,

915
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:31,200
 he knows it's scary to be us.

916
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,940
 We see in John 11 that Jesus sees the lament

917
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:39,060
 of Lazarus' sisters and he weeps.

918
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:43,760
 We see in the book of James that nothing is wasted

919
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,540
 and that suffering produces character

920
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,620
 and endurance, perseverance, and maturity.

921
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,740
 It makes us strong.

922
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,980
 That contrary to popular opinions,

923
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,540
 we are not candles that need to be protected

924
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,180
 from the wind lest we get snuffed out,

925
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,460
 but actually are like fires that the wind heats up

926
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,340
 and helps burn hotter.

927
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,700
 You could take the story of the Bible,

928
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,940
 Genesis to Revelation,

929
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,980
 and you could boil it down to three words,

930
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,560
 God with us.

931
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,960
 That's the story of the Bible.

932
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,460
 What's happening in Eden at creation except God with us,

933
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,160
 walking with them in the cool of the garden in the morning.

934
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,680
 And then what happens when God leads his people

935
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,680
 out of slavery and sets up the tabernacle

936
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,600
 right in the middle of their encampment,

937
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
 all of their tents.

938
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,200
 When you opened up your tents,

939
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,880
 you looked at the tabernacle

940
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,280
 and the manifest presence of God was there.

941
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,960
 Not by faith, by fire and smoke,

942
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,400
 the presence of God.

943
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,640
 And what happened at the temple?

944
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,040
 The glory of God fell

945
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,920
 and all of Jerusalem oriented around the temple,

946
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,480
 God with us.

947
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,200
 And what happens at the incarnation of Jesus Christ,

948
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,160
 except God with us.

949
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,720
 And then what happens at the coming of the Holy Spirit?

950
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,560
 At Pentecost, we're indwelt with the Holy Spirit,

951
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,080
 become temples of the living God.

952
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,240
 And God is with us.

953
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,360
 Suffering does not mean

954
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,600
 that we have been abandoned or forgotten.

955
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,200
 It's not what it means.

956
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,880
 God is with us in the mess.

957
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,000
 There's a great deal of mystery

958
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,560
 around the brokenness and hardship of life as a human being.

959
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,320
 It'll break your brain, it can get so awful.

960
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,620
 Again, I'm not naive to those things.

961
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,800
 I've pastored a large church for 20 years.

962
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,200
 A lot of small coffins

963
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,100
 and there shouldn't be small coffins.

964
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,840
 A lot of sicknesses that have ravaged a body

965
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,140
 long after you would think.

966
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:46,480
 A lot of random loss that feels insane.

967
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,020
 And that's just, I'm just talking about one local church.

968
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,620
 I'm not even talking about lifting your eyes up globally.

969
00:39:54,620 --> 00:40:02,380
 And yet to look around and try to make sense of that

970
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,200
 is crushing to the soul.

971
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:11,360
 And so the Lord says, "Look up, see me."

972
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,300
 See what in particular?

973
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,180
 I think primarily see Christ on the cross

974
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,800
 dying for your sins.

975
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,140
 If God is for you, who can be against you?

976
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:28,360
 Like to look up and see that God has moved towards you

977
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,560
 in his love regardless of your rebellion

978
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,000
 and my rebellion against him.

979
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,600
 That from Genesis to Revelation,

980
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,040
 God moves towards his people with grace,

981
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,640
 moves towards his people with forgiveness,

982
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,960
 moves towards his people with the promise of life,

983
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,960
 moves towards his people with the promise of joy

984
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,240
 and gratitude and belonging and hope.

985
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,240
 And one day glory and a sense of understanding.

986
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,780
 One day we get far enough back to see it.

987
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,860
 One day there's no remembrance of former things.

988
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,640
 One day there'll be no more tears in eyes.

989
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,680
 One day there'll be no more sickness and death.

990
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,200
 And in the already but not yet, in this space in between,

991
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,200
 the Lord would say, "Look up, look to the cross,

992
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,580
 "see my love for you, see how I've moved towards you.

993
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,560
 "Trust that I am at work in the mess."

994
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,560
 Because I think that's the story of the Bible.

995
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,200
 God at work in the mess.

996
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,160
 It's not that there's not a mess.

997
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,920
 It's that he's at work in it in a way

998
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,720
 that's mysterious to us and we can get lost in it

999
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,300
 if we try to look around and make sense of it.

1000
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,200
 And so here's what I wanna lay before you.

1001
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,900
 I think here's why I've come.

1002
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:44,260
 It has been my experience in Christian circles in particular

1003
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,460
 that if we're not careful,

1004
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,060
 we begin to move towards fatalism.

1005
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,940
 Like even though we've got the hope of the gospel,

1006
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,740
 we've got the hope of eternal life in us,

1007
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,540
 what ends up happening is we just start turning fatalistic.

1008
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,180
 And I think one of the ways that looks

1009
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,900
 is we cease to be prayerful,

1010
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,340
 we cease to be able to see what's good in our life

1011
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,900
 and all we can see is what's wrong.

1012
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
 I don't know if you know anybody like this right now

1013
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,360
 or maybe you find yourself in that place.

1014
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,540
 Listen, I've been tempted to go there myself

1015
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:12,100
 where I'm just so aware of everything that needs to be fixed

1016
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:17,040
 that I can't see just how good and beautiful and kind

1017
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,000
 God has been to me.

1018
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,900
 Like I haven't recounted his goodness

1019
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,880
 because I've seen these five or six or eight

1020
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,980
 or 10 or 12 things that drive me nuts

1021
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,720
 that I don't understand, that seem cruel and unjust,

1022
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,520
 so I can't see any of the beauty and grace in my life

1023
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,380
 for all of the kind of railing against what's broken.

1024
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,600
 And I wonder if you find yourself there,

1025
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,320
 you can feel yourself growing jaded.

1026
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,960
 Just feel it, like you just feel yourself growing jaded,

1027
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:49,240
 slipping, getting angrier,

1028
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,440
 wanting to create distance from the Lord

1029
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,000
 and from other believers.

1030
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,880
 And part of what I wanna do in coming tonight

1031
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,740
 is like, hey, don't look up.

1032
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,600
 I know I'm not trying to take away from you

1033
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,280
 how frustrating hurt is.

1034
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,720
 I'm not trying to take away from you confusion.

1035
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,000
 I'm not trying to take away from you

1036
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,080
 even like not understanding what I'm trying to do

1037
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,840
 is lift your eyes up to God's love for you in Christ.

1038
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,900
 So I wanna call you out of that fatalism

1039
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,320
 or maybe you're not fatalistic at all.

1040
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,360
 Maybe you've gone the other way.

1041
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,400
 Maybe you just made some unholy vows.

1042
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,840
 Nobody's gonna hurt you again.

1043
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,660
 You're not gonna lose anybody you love anymore

1044
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,680
 and you got your whole world so locked down.

1045
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,160
 You are so trying to control your entire environment

1046
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,300
 that you are redlining.

1047
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,840
 I mean, you are anxious and afraid

1048
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,880
 and barely hanging in there

1049
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,080
 as you try to make sure nothing happens to anybody.

1050
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,920
 Like you've taken on kind of like mother hen responsibilities

1051
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,100
 for your whole crew.

1052
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:49,920
 Like I wanna call you out of detachment.

1053
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,880
 I wanna call you back into being loved and loving,

1054
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,880
 trusting again, leaning into the risk of being fully known

1055
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,000
 and fully knowing others to give love another shot.

1056
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,220
 And then man, I wanna, if I can,

1057
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,100
 I wanna bag on karma a little bit

1058
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,980
 because you're not under wrath, you're under mercy.

1059
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,640
 And again, this is,

1060
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,480
 I was talking to the leadership before this

1061
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,380
 and the big struggle of my life,

1062
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,000
 it'll be the, I think my struggle the rest of my life.

1063
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,560
 I think I've got some family of origin issues

1064
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,280
 that kind of make this flare,

1065
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,440
 but it is really easy for me to believe

1066
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,840
 that I'm useful for God, to God.

1067
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,080
 Then God finds me useful.

1068
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,120
 I like this kid, we're gonna use him.

1069
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,120
 It's harder for me to believe

1070
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,320
 that he just loves me and delights in me.

1071
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,400
 That's just a hard sell for me.

1072
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,440
 I'm like, I read it in the book.

1073
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,040
 I can wrestle with it in the book.

1074
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,880
 It's just hard for me, man.

1075
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,880
 I'm an achiever, I'm a doer.

1076
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,420
 I received affirmation and affection by accomplishment,

1077
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,000
 not by being.

1078
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,320
 And the Lord's always just like, no, it's you.

1079
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,240
 I was like, you're what I like, I like you.

1080
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,840
 I'm like, well, I did this for you.

1081
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,760
 Like, great, but you, why don't you come hang out with me?

1082
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,640
 Well, I would, but I gotta do this stuff

1083
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,480
 because I know you like that.

1084
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,240
 He's like, no, I didn't ask you for that, I want you.

1085
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,000
 And I wonder how many of you feel stuck

1086
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,920
 in this idea of karma,

1087
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,720
 like you're incessantly trying to work to please the Lord,

1088
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,280
 incessantly trying to be good so he'll bless you,

1089
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,600
 incessantly trying to check this box

1090
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,800
 and circle this box and accomplish this

1091
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,200
 so that he'll finally love you.

1092
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,920
 I've said this for 20 years, almost every time I've preached.

1093
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,460
 God is not in love with some future version of you.

1094
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,660
 And I wish you'd, by the grace of God,

1095
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,540
 drive that out of your head.

1096
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,420
 It's not like once you get that right,

1097
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,140
 you and God are finally cool.

1098
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,060
 You're cool because of what Christ did,

1099
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,900
 not because of what you do.

1100
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,800
 You're reconciled because of the finished work of Jesus,

1101
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,020
 not because you're figuring some things out.

1102
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,660
 Now, you figuring those things out

1103
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,340
 will, can lead to greater intimacy

1104
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,560
 and experience of his presence.

1105
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,180
 But there's nothing salvific in your behavior

1106
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,280
 or Christ didn't need to die on the cross.

1107
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,140
 Like it was his death that justifies you,

1108
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,620
 his death that makes you whole,

1109
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,620
 his death that heals you once and for all.

1110
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,420
 And so all I wanted to do in our limited time tonight

1111
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,820
 is I don't think hardly anybody talks about suffering

1112
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,940
 anymore, we always talk about the joy of the Lord.

1113
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,840
 And what's amazing about his presence

1114
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,920
 is that people in the scriptures

1115
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,940
 who endure some horrific things

1116
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,920
 still seem to have a joy, not a happiness,

1117
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,660
 a joy that's rooted in something bigger

1118
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,900
 than their circumstances.

1119
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,300
 And if I could give you anything

1120
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:27,380
 as you kind of keep running the long journey home,

1121
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,180
 it would be maybe just a little bit more understanding

1122
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,020
 that the world is broken,

1123
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,220
 that suffering's going to be normal,

1124
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,220
 and that Jesus is good.

1125
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:40,260
 And to not try to look around and make sense of it

1126
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,180
 as much as you look up and gaze upon the beauty of God

1127
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,860
 in sending the son to die for your sins,

1128
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:49,740
 resurrect to show the bill's been paid in full,

1129
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,980
 and that life, real life, full life

1130
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,980
 is available to you in Jesus now.

1131
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,800
 Why don't you do me a favor?

1132
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,460
 Why don't you just bow your heads and close your eyes?

1133
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,900
 If that's weird for you, I promise,

1134
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,420
 nobody's gonna touch you or take your stuff,

1135
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,660
 well, I don't think they will.

1136
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,220
 I'm sure there's some shady people in here,

1137
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,060
 but just bow your heads, close your eyes,

1138
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,960
 but just keep your stuff close to you.

1139
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,300
 All right, just a couple of questions, and they don't,

1140
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,700
 it's really between you and the Lord,

1141
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,300
 it's not between me and you, I promise.

1142
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,900
 I'll head to a meeting after this

1143
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,220
 and then back up to Flower Mound.

1144
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,780
 So I just wanted to ask,

1145
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,540
 like just maybe in a moment of vulnerability

1146
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,820
 between you and the Lord,

1147
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:29,580
 I just wanted to ask if you find yourself

1148
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,260
 in this season of life,

1149
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:40,080
 growing jaded, like growing frustrated,

1150
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,560
 growing distant from the Lord,

1151
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:47,300
 and it's tied to some heartbreak,

1152
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,580
 some disappointment, some disease,

1153
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,140
 some death, some confusion,

1154
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,860
 some bit of brokenness that you just don't get,

1155
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,020
 and it's hard for you to reconcile

1156
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,700
 that He's good and that this is possible.

1157
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,020
 And you're just in a season where you're like,

1158
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:04,620
 man, I can feel my heart growing colder

1159
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,080
 towards the Lord because of these things.

1160
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:07,920
 If that's you and you're in the room,

1161
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,980
 would you just raise your hand high,

1162
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,540
 like just raise, just get it up high.

1163
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,860
 You don't have anything to be embarrassed.

1164
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,220
 I mean, you are like you are among

1165
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,600
 almost everybody in the Bible.

1166
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,620
 Yeah, like let's get them high like we're not Baptist.

1167
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:20,740
 There we go.

1168
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,580
 All right, praise God.

1169
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,120
 Listen, there are so many of you in here.

1170
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,380
 So go ahead and put your hands down.

1171
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,420
 Now I want you to look up at me.

1172
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,260
 If you had your hand up,

1173
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,500
 I mean, all of you can look up at me.

1174
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,220
 The Lord sees you.

1175
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:35,220
 I would just press a little bit

1176
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,140
 that you might think about the rest of the night tonight

1177
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,780
 like this.

1178
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,140
 Like this message isn't getting me

1179
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,740
 a lot of followers on Instagram.

1180
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:47,180
 This message isn't like, oh, that was awesome tonight.

1181
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,260
 This is more of a disorienting thing

1182
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,940
 to come in here and talk about.

1183
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,860
 It's certainly not a popularity one.

1184
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,500
 So like I'd have done dating if I wanted that.

1185
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:00,020
 But this is the thing that will strengthen your soul

1186
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,720
 for life as it is.

1187
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,460
 And so here's what I'm gonna ask.

1188
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,940
 I'm gonna pray for us.

1189
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:08,140
 And we've got some more singing to do tonight,

1190
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,980
 but there are gonna be men and women up here

1191
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,900
 and they're gonna pray.

1192
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,620
 And if you raised your hand tonight,

1193
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,360
 I just want you to be so bold as to come and receive prayer.

1194
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,820
 Just come and let people who aren't in that season,

1195
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:20,680
 they either have been or they will be one day,

1196
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,660
 they're not in that season right now,

1197
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,580
 just pray for you.

1198
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,900
 Just pray courage back into your bones.

1199
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,760
 Pray life back into your bones.

1200
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,060
 I don't want you to walk in shame.

1201
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,740
 I don't want you to walk in shame right now.

1202
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:38,100
 I want you to be so bold as to say,

1203
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,220
 I need someone to pray for me

1204
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,580
 'cause I am slipping here, man.

1205
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,460
 And that's scaring me.

1206
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,340
 I want somebody to pray for me.

1207
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,780
 And so I'm gonna pray.

1208
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,180
 And then there's gonna be a group of men and women

1209
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,420
 that come up front and they're already coming.

1210
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,980
 And then we're gonna stand and sing, is that right?

1211
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,380
 Davey, are we gonna stand and sing?

1212
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,100
 We're gonna stand and sing.

1213
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:55,940
 You like that?

1214
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,300
 I probably could have looked at the notes, it's fine.

1215
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,240
 I'm already over.

1216
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,220
 And then we're gonna stand and sing.

1217
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,420
 And here's what, if you raised your hand,

1218
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,100
 I'm telling you, man, there's like 100 and something of you

1219
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,980
 that you not talk yourself out of it,

1220
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,300
 that you not justify, I'm fine, that was enough.

1221
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,380
 Just raising my hand was enough.

1222
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,740
 And that you would,

1223
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,500
 this might be a little too charismatic for you,

1224
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,580
 you might activate some faith in your heart

1225
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,440
 by moving your body.

1226
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,620
 You might come up and grab the hands out.

1227
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:22,620
 You're not gonna make anybody gasp up here.

1228
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,820
 You tracking with me?

1229
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,420
 Like you're not gonna say something that makes them go,

1230
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,240
 (gasps)

1231
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,140
 we don't know what to do with you.

1232
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,060
 That's not going to happen tonight.

1233
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,300
 We know exactly what to do.

1234
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,540
 They're here for you.

1235
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:36,580
 I'm gonna pray, we're all gonna stand together.

1236
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,420
 And then I just wanna make one last appeal.

1237
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,780
 I know that you're in your head right now.

1238
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,540
 I know it 'cause I've been in that seat.

1239
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,980
 First seven years of my marriage, train wreck.

1240
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,300
 Don't gasp, if she were here, she'd say, yep.

1241
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,860
 And got to battle brain cancer for 18 months,

1242
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,580
 was told I'd had two years to live.

1243
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:57,780
 I've been down there.

1244
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,180
 I buried little boys and little girls.

1245
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:03,460
 I've seen good men die of cancer

1246
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,560
 where scandalous ones stay alive.

1247
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:12,140
 Like come and receive the kindness of the Lord to you

1248
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,640
 in this season, in this moment.

1249
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,480
 He sees you.

1250
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,400
 Why am I here?

1251
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,660
 Except that he sees you.

1252
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,860
 Why this for you tonight if he doesn't see you?

1253
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,660
 Now you receive from him now what he has for you,

1254
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,300
 blessing and hope and courage

1255
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,600
 from someone who's not in that spot right now.

1256
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,100
 Father, I bless these men and women in the name of Jesus.

1257
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,740
 I thank you for your goodness and grace.

1258
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,140
 Like even the ones that aren't in this room

1259
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,220
 and they're all over the country.

1260
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,300
 I can't see that room, I just see this one,

1261
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,660
 but I know humanity enough to know,

1262
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,860
 gosh, my friend is right.

1263
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:48,020
 It is scary to be us and you know it.

1264
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:52,420
 And so I don't pretend to know all the hurt that's in here,

1265
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,940
 all the disappointment that's in here,

1266
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,180
 but I know that it's real.

1267
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,940
 And I know that it hurts.

1268
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,420
 And I know that it's disorienting.

1269
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,340
 And I know we can feel stuck in it.

1270
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,260
 And I know we can feel like

1271
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,900
 we're never gonna get out of it.

1272
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:07,260
 And I just rebuke the enemy right now

1273
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,260
 because we will get out of it.

1274
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:12,380
 This moment is not our lives.

1275
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,140
 This moment is not our lives.

1276
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,100
 And so I ask Holy Spirit,

1277
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,940
 minister to your sons and daughters,

1278
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,980
 minister to our hearts tonight

1279
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:22,220
 in a profound and beautiful way.

1280
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:26,540
 Grant courage and boldness to those who are in the pit.

1281
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,260
 And it's for your beautiful name I pray, amen.

1282
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,940
 Would you stand with me as we sing?

1283
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,380
 If you need prayer, you come grab it, they're here.
