[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   >> Ports, how we doing?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.200]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.920]   >> Love it, love it.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.920]   So in my transition and kind of, right, I think this was,
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.800]   trying to time stamp this, I think this was just before I became a Christian.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.520]   Probably around 12, 13, 13 years ago.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.600]   A friend in Dallas, so I was not a Christian as a young adult in Dallas.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.280]   I'm kind of living in the bars and the clubs of Lower Greenville at the time and
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.280]   the uptown scene, and that's a part of my story.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.200]   And so this friend invites me to this really exclusive kind of
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.040]   gathering club thing on Knox Henderson there.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.400]   And so I didn't know, and they're like, hey, you gotta be on the list.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.920]   Your name needs to be on the list, let's go.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.400]   And I'm like, okay, yeah, well, let's go check that out.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.440]   And so we're driving, and I'm kind of looking at the clubs that have all the
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.360]   lights and the stuff, come here, this would be fun, that kind of.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.440]   And then we pull up to this, we valet, and then there's just a door.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.000]   It's really unmarked, and there's a line in front of the door, and
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.840]   there's a big bouncer there.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.480]   And so we get in that line, like this is the place, like really, it's this?
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.680]   And my friend, we were separate, by the way, and so they had told me,
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.840]   they had assured me that they had put my name on the list,
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.160]   your name has to be on the list.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.920]   And so I'm kind of watching this line whittle down as I walk up there, and
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.000]   these insecurities start to set in, right?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.520]   And because this guy, he's up there, and I mean, huge guy, bigger than me.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.960]   I mean, looks like he ate a, well, he looks like Luke, actually,
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.440]   the guy that did announcements.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.000]   And so he's up there, and he's just kind of checking this list.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.560]   And there's this guy, a couple people in front of me, and he gets up there, and
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.840]   this bouncer looks at the list, and the dude tells his name,
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.160]   looks at the list again, flips the page, shakes his head.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.880]   And dude does the walk of shame back to his car.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.400]   And then I'm like, what if I gotta do the walk of shame?
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.360]   Like, what if they didn't put my name down on this list?
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.440]   I'm gonna get up there, like how embarrassing is that gonna be that I
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.640]   think I'm gonna go into this place, my friend told me it was gonna be this
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.040]   amazing thing at the time, what mattered to me, open bar, lots of free food,
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.800]   you know, great time, I'm excited about it, I'm in this line, I think I'm gonna go in.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.400]   And then I'm thinking, all these insecurities hit, and
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.120]   I'm like, what if my name's not on the list?
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.320]   And I think for a lot of us, right, like in fact, if we can,
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.000]   just before we go further, let's just do this.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.160]   I want the weight of tonight to hit us early,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.600]   honestly, like where we're headed in this sermon on the mount.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.480]   So would you close your eyes, and I just want you to envision something.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:15.720]   So let's say you die, and you're standing in heaven, bright light.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.840]   And you see in the distance Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.920]   And you're moving toward him, and it hits you the reality that everything
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.600]   that you had heard about Christianity is true.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.200]   And you're just like, this is crazy, it's real, I'm in heaven.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.960]   And then you begin to get excited because you've heard about heaven.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.160]   And you're thinking, this is gonna be incredible.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.000]   Like for the rest of eternity, I get to be with God, and you move closer to Jesus.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.720]   And he says this, and I'm just gonna read to you the words tonight.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.080]   You get closer to Jesus, there you are face to face with him, and he says,
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.080]   not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.280]   But only the one who did the will of my Father who lives here.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.040]   And you might say, Lord, Lord, did I not serve in your name and
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.480]   do good to others in your name and share with others?
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.760]   I went to church, I attended the porch, I read my Bible.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.760]   And then he tells you plainly,
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.160]   I never knew you away from me, you evildoer.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.080]   You can come back with me.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.560]   Those are the closing words tonight.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.880]   In this message, as Jesus moves through the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.640]   he's coming to the end of his sermon, and he ends with a bang.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.560]   He wants you to feel this in Matthew chapter 7.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.840]   Because the reality of it is, friends, there are only two religions.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.480]   In the entire world, there really are only two religions.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.200]   I know that flies in the face of maybe what you came in here thinking.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.920]   But the reality of it is there is the religion of those who have trusted in
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.880]   Christ, God's provision through his son Jesus, his death and
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.680]   resurrection for the forgiveness of their sins, and then there is everything else.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.440]   There is the worship of the evil one, Satan, and
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.200]   then there's the inadvertent worship of the evil one, Satan,
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.920]   through any other religion out there.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.000]   Anything that you think will get you to paradise outside of trusting in God's
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.960]   provision and God's provision alone in Jesus Christ.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.560]   Now, I understand that to some of you that is unbelievably offensive.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.640]   And would you just hang out with me for 30 minutes?
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.720]   Let's teach this text.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.520]   And if at the end of it we still disagree, I'd love a conversation with you.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.800]   I'll stay as late as I need to, to have a conversation with you.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.680]   And so excited about where we are.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.320]   It's truth.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.880]   It's God's sovereign truth.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.240]   I saw one of you tweeted that earlier, and I love that.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.280]   And so tonight we're talking about the two paths to heaven.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.680]   And I think so many of us, we view Jesus like that bouncer that has this list, and
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.680]   he's letting some in and keeping others out.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.760]   And I wanna see what part of that vision in our minds is true and
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.240]   what part of that vision in our minds is absolutely inconsistent with the word of
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.400]   God before we leave here this evening.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.600]   And so we're in this series called Summer on the Mount,
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.480]   where on June 10th is where we started, and we started talking about the Beatitudes.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.160]   The next message, we covered the fulfillment of the law in Jesus Christ.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.200]   And then we talked about dealing with anger, as Jesus taught it.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.720]   And then Jesus taught us about lust and adultery.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.960]   As we move further in the Sermon on the Mount, we talked about commitment.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.120]   Then we talked about love for our enemies.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.320]   Then we talked about fake Christianity.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.680]   Then we talked about an eternal perspective.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.880]   And then we talked about what judge not lest you be judged really means.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.760]   And then last week, we talked about praying to a good father who loves us and
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.840]   desires to give us good.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.080]   We'll have one more week after tonight, and we'll go to launch.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.520]   And then we'll come back and start a new series.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.560]   And so excited about what God has for us ahead.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.000]   Tonight, we're gonna cover two paths.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.560]   Everyone is on one of two paths.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.440]   Two types of prophets.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.800]   One leads people astray.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.920]   And two types of people.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.440]   Those who will be with God forever, and those who won't.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.760]   See, there's two types of people.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.280]   There's those whose name is on that list right now, and
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.680]   there's those whose name is not on that list right now.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.560]   So let's dive in.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.360]   Matthew chapter 7, we'll start in verse 13.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.160]   Jesus says this.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:53.120]   Enter through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.440]   broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.120]   But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.160]   only a few find it.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.560]   Jesus commands you to enter.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.440]   And he says, everyone will enter one of the gate.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.400]   He says, most people will enter this gate, the wide gate.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.880]   The one that is attractive to the world.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.840]   Everyone come in this gate, but there's a sub gate.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:27.920]   Much smaller, difficult to find, he says.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.600]   And he says specifically, Jesus Christ, Lord on the earth,
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.760]   goes out of his way to say, only a few will enter here.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.880]   And so he says, he exhorts you, porch, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston,
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:48.080]   wherever you are, enter through that gate, please.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:54.440]   My first point this evening is there are two paths, but only one leads to paradise.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.160]   But I want you to know they both present paradise.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.040]   No one says, hey, come here, go to hell.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.880]   It's gonna be awesome.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.400]   Weeping and gnashing of teeth, come in, come once.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.920]   They both present paradise.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:14.080]   Every false gospel out there, every false ideology out there
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.760]   is presenting to you some kind of good.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.720]   It is a bait and switch.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.400]   It says, hey, come in here and find life.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.400]   This is where life is.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.040]   And so many here tonight and so many listening have bought the lie
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:37.000]   that life is in the wrong place when Jesus Christ says, no, life's in here.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.160]   Make sure you enter this door, this narrow gate.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:48.200]   He says the other one, that's the road that the majority travels.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.760]   That's heavy for us tonight, right?
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:56.800]   I mean, family goes down the road of the majority, the friends, close loved ones.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.200]   That's really heavy.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:06.400]   Many, he says most, most people, you might hear sometimes people say,
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.720]   well, I think most people go to heaven.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.920]   Well, that's just not what Jesus said.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.120]   Jesus said few.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.680]   He says most people don't go to heaven.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.720]   Most people go to hell.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.880]   That's what he's saying right here.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.920]   That's the road that many travel.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.600]   He says, few find the small gate.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.240]   It's not the normal path.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.920]   And so here's what I would tell you here.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:31.000]   If you spend your money like everyone else does, if you date like everyone else does,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.200]   if you go the way of the crowds, you might want to make sure you enter
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.800]   through the right gate.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.640]   But he says the people that enter through this gate, it's the marginal, the minority,
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:52.880]   the few, the weird ones, the odd ones, maybe the outcast, maybe the downtrodden.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.400]   Few have found the truth.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   Just consider that for a minute, like the few have found the truth.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.480]   How many people, if you just left here, and let's say you went somewhere,
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.240]   let's say you went to the mall, and you started going up to people and you say,
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.440]   "Hey, how do you get to heaven?"
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:13.120]   How many people would you talk to until someone said, "Well, you trust in God's
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.640]   provision through Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection."
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.200]   That's the only way.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.200]   I mean, you may hear, you know, "Hey, there's not a heaven."
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.240]   You may hear, "Well, you do good works.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.600]   You try to have your good works outweigh the bad.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.000]   You try to be a good person."
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.160]   I don't know, believe in God.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.040]   I don't know, know God.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.440]   I don't know, read the Bible, go to church.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.040]   You might hear those answers, but how many people would you have to talk...
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.920]   All of those are false gospels.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.920]   They're all not true.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.960]   They're all lies, and they lead you straight into this door.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.320]   And then there's one, "Trust in Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection for the
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.080]   forgiveness of sins."
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:57.040]   Do you see how wide the road is that outside of trust in Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.240]   for the forgiveness of sins?
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.120]   For he says in John chapter 10, verse 9 and 10, "I am the gate.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.240]   Whoever enters through me will be saved.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.820]   They will come in and go out and find pasture.
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.540]   The thief, that's Satan, comes only to steal, kill, and destroy.
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.820]   I have come that they may have life and have it to the full."
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.000]   So many of you think Jesus wants to rip you off.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.760]   Jesus wants to set you free.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.400]   Jesus wants to give you life so for the first time you can have life.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.680]   I have partied hard, man.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.000]   I have lived, I have searched the world.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.960]   I have pursued money, drugs, sex, so many things where I thought life was only to come
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.360]   to a place where I found life in Jesus Christ.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.440]   And I thought if you found life in Jesus Christ that you were delusional.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.760]   And so some of you here tonight, I imagine, think that those that say, "Hey, we want to
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.080]   live radically for Christ," are delusional, we're not.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.680]   We've just found something for true that's true.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.840]   We've just found truth.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:00.680]   I remember really in my transition when I had trusted in Christ and I had stopped hitting
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.160]   the bar scene and the club scene and there was this grand opening of this bar on Lower
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160]   Greenville.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.160]   It was called the Sugar Shack.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.400]   Anybody hear this?
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.920]   Lower Greenville, if you're listening, is just kind of the club scene or was especially,
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.560]   more so even in my day.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:20.480]   And that makes me feel old, in my day, back in my day.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.160]   And so it was the grand opening of this place called the Sugar Shack.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.960]   I think it's called, it's like the Bulzerk.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.480]   It's right by the Old Crow, if you're familiar with that area.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.080]   I know all of you are like, "Lower Greenville, where is that?"
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.000]   But anyways, and so the Sugar Shack was the grand opening.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.400]   And it was kind of the same deal.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.380]   Like there was a big buzz about it and everybody wanted to go.
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.160]   And so there was this long line and you'd wait in the long line of people and then you'd
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.760]   eventually make your way into the grand opening and then you'd fight your way to the bar because
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.120]   it was so crowded.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.120]   And the DJ was in there.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.380]   They brought in this DJ and everybody was jumping around and bouncing, just dancing
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.200]   and having a great time.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.440]   And then lo and behold, the floor fell out on the grand opening.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.720]   The wooden floor, which sat lots of feet above the concrete floor, which was 20 years old,
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.520]   fell and the entire club crashed through the floor.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:14.160]   And I remember, in fact, here's a quote from someone that just says, "Everyone was having
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.640]   fun and suddenly the floor opens up and everyone starts screaming and people are being carried
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.600]   out on stretchers."
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.080]   You see that wide road?
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.920]   It has a trap door, man.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.580]   Like that's what I think we're dancing off a cliff, man.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:38.600]   I think we are living in this world in the pursuit of every indulgence and pleasure and
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:44.040]   comfort that we can find, keeping God out of it, keeping some sort of idea of like,
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.040]   "Yeah, I know God.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.560]   Now let me get all the pleasure I can."
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:54.080]   And you don't know God.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.480]   You don't have a real relationship with the creator.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:06.300]   And I'm trying to tell you, Jesus is trying to tell you, that's the wide road.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.700]   That's the wide road.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.540]   And the wide path has a trap door.
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.800]   And we're dancing off that cliff.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.960]   We are partying off that cliff and you don't win.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.880]   And it does not go well in the end.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:28.380]   And God is begging you, pleading with you to something else.
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.780]   And you say, "Well, how do you know He is?"
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.220]   Because you're here right now on a Tuesday night.
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.300]   You hear this message.
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:40.460]   You're going to leave here and return back to your wicked ways, back to your life, your
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.740]   pursuit of money, back to your pursuit of sex, back to your pursuit of pleasures.
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.900]   No, the Lord loves you so much.
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:54.280]   On a Tuesday night, He has you hearing this.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.920]   This path is enticing, right?
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.560]   I mean, everyone, they want this path.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.680]   It looks like the right path.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:05.720]   And everyone on this path thinks they've chosen correctly.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.960]   Like the people that have gone through this door, they think they have chosen the right
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.640]   gate.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.560]   And they've been deceived.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:21.240]   And they've been deceived by people, even people with Bibles, using truth to manipulate.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.920]   Let's go back, verse 15.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.920]   Watch out for false prophets.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:33.760]   They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.080]   By their fruit you will recognize them.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.000]   Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles?
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.960]   Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.680]   A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:56.200]   Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.720]   Thus by their fruit you will recognize them.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.500]   Let me just, let me, it's heavy, I know.
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.080]   So let me back up and just remind you.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.840]   Jesus is using prime real estate in the greatest sermon ever told, and He's wrapping it up.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.400]   And before He finishes, He says, "Hey, I've got to tell you something."
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.920]   Like you've got to hear this, man.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.840]   Like this is important.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:19.840]   And so my second point this evening is there are two types of prophets, and many of those
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.640]   prophets are posers.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.800]   Many of them are posers.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.800]   They're fakes.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.800]   They're frauds.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:30.640]   They are not true, and you've got to learn to discern which ones are true of God, teachers,
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:35.080]   disciple-makers, teachers, and which ones are posers, because they both appear to be
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.800]   good.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:42.560]   And He says, "How do you tell the difference between a real prophet and a false prophet?"
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.920]   He says, "By their fruit."
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:49.760]   He goes off on this gardening illustration, and He just says, "Hey, what does that mean?"
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.360]   Here's how I would translate that.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.020]   By their product, by what they produce.
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.060]   So think about this.
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:00.000]   You know a teacher by a student.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.320]   You know a disciple-maker by the disciples that they produce, because whatever they love,
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.600]   their people are going to love.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.600]   Their followers.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.600]   Disciple is just a word for follower.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.720]   Christian is just a word for follower of Jesus, follower of Christ.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.400]   He says, "You will know them by their fruit."
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.800]   And so in context, He's talking about the Pharisees that are there.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.760]   So He's teaching this sermon outside.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.120]   His disciples are close, and then the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the teachers of the
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.120]   law are there.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.120]   Jesus had this ministry to them, opposing them.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.040]   These were the religious people, and He expounds on that.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.120]   There's a commentary on this in Matthew chapter 23.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.440]   You could read the whole chapter.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.640]   There's several woes to the Pharisees, but in verse 15, He just says this, "Woe to you,
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.640]   teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites."
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.640]   What is a hypocrite?
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.400]   It's somebody that appears to be one thing, but is really something else.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.800]   You hypocrites.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.680]   You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.040]   make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.360]   You already said, "Hey, woe to you religious people.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:13.360]   You go on mission trips to Africa and to Hades and all over the world, and when you get there,
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.120]   you don't make them know God.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.920]   You make them worship you.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:24.040]   You do it so that they would think highly of you, more of you.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.040]   You're making followers of you, not followers of me."
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.720]   Then He says this in verse 33, "You snakes, you brood of vipers, how will you escape being
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.720]   condemned to hell?
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.320]   Therefore I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers."
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.120]   See, also Paul, Peter, John.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.400]   "Some of them you will kill and crucify.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.880]   Others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town."
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.040]   What an incredible prophecy Jesus says here.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:53.600]   He says, "I'm going to send to you my disciples, and you're going to kill them."
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.720]   That did not come true.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:20:02.040]   They crucified Peter upside down, beheaded Paul, boiled John alive, threw James, his
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.800]   brother from the top of the temple, and then beat him with clubs because they wouldn't
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.080]   deny the resurrected Jesus.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.120]   Why wouldn't they deny the resurrected Jesus?
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.120]   Because they knew it was true.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.120]   They had seen it with their own eyes.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.080]   So who are the false prophets today?
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:25.240]   I tell you, prosperity teachers you see on TV are the first ones that come to mind.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.200]   First Timothy chapter 6, he gives a whole section to this.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.640]   He says, "These are false teachers."
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:40.400]   Anyone who tells you that godliness is a means to financial gain, that's a liar and a false
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.960]   teacher.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:46.360]   If anyone says, "Hey, give me your money, and I'll give you, and God's going to give
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:52.680]   you more money," they are a liar or a blackjack dealer or something.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.680]   It says this in First Timothy 6, "If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:03.240]   sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ, other than the gospel, and to godly teaching,
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.400]   they are conceited and understand nothing.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.000]   They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.680]   strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions, and constant friction between people of corrupt
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:22.000]   mind who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.760]   gain."
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.280]   What is the fruit of their teaching?
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.000]   Godliness equals financial gain.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.520]   Some of you have bought into some false teaching.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.000]   Some of you here tonight.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   I think so many of us, we pursue God, hoping just in return to get a better us.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.160]   That's not what God is offering you.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.400]   He's not offering you your best life.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.520]   He's offering you His best life.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.840]   He's not offering you a better you.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:04.360]   He's offering you Him forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:09.760]   My friend calls that therapeutic moralistic deism.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.000]   He says that's the number one religion today.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:22.200]   That is that you believe in God, therefore you do good to feel better.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.120]   The center of your theology is you.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.320]   It's self-centeredness.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.360]   It is the greatest opposition to the church today.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.720]   Narcissism.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   Self-centeredness.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.520]   It's why depression levels are at an all-time high.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.960]   Because we think about us too much.
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:45.980]   God says, "Will you stop thinking about you altogether and start to thinking about me
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.760]   and loving others?"
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:49.760]   Loving God and loving others.
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.000]   It's His will for your life.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.840]   His purpose for your life.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:01.640]   Anyone who teaches a false doctrine is a false teacher.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.640]   What does that mean?
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.640]   That includes, so Jesus is who He's talking about here outside in our context, outside
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.240]   the context of the Pharisees.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.120]   He's talking about world religions.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:16.960]   Outside of Christianity, He's talking about cults that include works plus Jesus or Jesus
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.200]   plus works.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.520]   Any ideology, let me break it down for you like this.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:28.320]   Any ideology that says you are saved by anything other than Christ's works alone is false
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.320]   teaching.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.480]   Doesn't that make it so simple for you?
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.800]   If they're teaching anything other than salvation by grace through faith alone, faith in Jesus
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.520]   Christ, His works alone, it is false teaching.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.160]   It is not true teaching.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.560]   You're being deceived and you're just there saying, "Hey, come in."
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.200]   They may not even know it, but they're saying, "Hey, come in.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.000]   Enter the wide road."
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.840]   It's paradise, man.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:53.840]   Paradise is in here.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.840]   Come on.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.840]   Come one and for all.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.840]   Enter this gate.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.920]   Meanwhile, Jesus said, "No, I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no one gets to
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.800]   the Father except through me."
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.400]   John 14, 6.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.400]   This is the way.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.320]   For it is by grace you have been saved through faith.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.320]   This is not of yourselves.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.640]   This is the gift of God, not by works so that no one can boast.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.480]   Ephesians 2, 8, 9.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.920]   Wide is the road, but narrow is the gate.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:25.560]   Some of you are like, "But they're really good people.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.560]   Like Gandhi was a good person."
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.760]   If he did not know Jesus, he's not with Jesus.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.680]   The Dalai Lama, a good person.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.960]   The problem with that is God says, "No one's good, not even one.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.800]   And I promise you, nobody is good enough to get into heaven."
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:51.000]   Oprah, if she has not trusted in Christ, she will not be in his kingdom.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:58.680]   He has the guest list, and he's invited all his friends.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:04.120]   False teachers.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.760]   We went to, I say we, we do this deal called Unashamed.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.120]   I know a lot of you are familiar with it.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.960]   It's where we go, we call it a mission trip in Dallas, and we go to Dallas, and we share
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:18.520]   Christ in the city of Dallas, in uptown, and lower Greenville, and West Dallas, and kind
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:25.920]   of our hometown, and Exotica, the pornography convention was here last week, a couple weeks
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.920]   ago.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.720]   And so they had an Unashamed that weekend, and so Ryan and Allie and their friends went
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.160]   down there, and they just stood outside of Exotica and shared the love of Christ with
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.760]   those that are there, those that are looking for hope and the pleasures of sex and the
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.360]   sex industry.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.840]   Sadly, there were some other people who called themselves Christians there.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.400]   They were sat there at the gate, and as people came out, they said, "You deserve to be raped."
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.000]   They said, "You deserve AIDS in the name of Jesus.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.560]   That's false teaching."
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.360]   He says, "You will know them by their fruit."
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.360]   Who are those people?
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.200]   They're the disciples of false teachers.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.760]   That's the fruit of false teaching are those people.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.600]   They bought some other gospel.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.120]   But how can I say that?
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:12.080]   Because what is the fruit of God's spirit that indwells us?
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:20.920]   Galatians 5 tells us it's love, joy, peace, forbearance or patience, kindness, goodness,
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.720]   gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.000]   Where in that is, "Hey, you deserve to be raped."
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Where is that in the fruit of the spirit, friends?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.120]   False teachers.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.800]   Know them by their fruits.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.280]   False teachers.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.280]   False teaching.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.280]   How do you know a good teacher by their student?
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:45.920]   The other day, my little girl, Finley, she's six years old, and we're driving down the
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.840]   road coming back from family camp, and we're listening to the radio.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:56.280]   She just says, "Daddy, who do you think is trusted in Jesus more, Taylor Swift or Katy
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.280]   Perry?"
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:01.760]   I said, "I don't know, babe.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:10.000]   They both got bad blood."
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.880]   I said, "I don't know, Finley, but here's what I know about T. Swift and Katy Perry.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.880]   They're both false teachers.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:25.640]   Baby girl, that's what you need to know.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.280]   When you want to reflect on last Friday night or when you're feeling 22, you need to know
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.600]   that's a false gospel.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:38.120]   When you're trying to fill a blank space with anything else, I'm not even trying to be funny
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.120]   or culturally relevant.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.520]   Maybe I am.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.920]   I'm just saying, hey, that's a false gospel.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.600]   That is false teaching.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.360]   It affects your cultural worldview, too.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.920]   Some of us, that would be it.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:28:00.360]   If we could just be like them, if you could just be like a false teacher, what do you
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:06.760]   think Jesus is saying here in Matthew chapter 7?
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:10.000]   He's called us out of the world to be different from the world.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.680]   I think some of us are in goal as the world.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:21.600]   He's called us out of the world that we would stand in contrast to the world not to set
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:26.400]   our goal on worldliness, that we would be like the world.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.400]   What are you saying?
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.240]   That I need to be a radical Christian?
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.440]   I don't even know that there's such thing as a radical Christian.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:36.320]   I think they're just run-of-the-mill normal Christians.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.200]   People who give their money away to the poor, care for widows and orphans.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.460]   People who share the gospel everywhere they go.
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:46.600]   People who feast on the word of God.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:52.600]   People who sell out for the pleasures of the world for completely and full devotion to
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.600]   God.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.040]   That's not radical Christianity.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.680]   It's just Christianity.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:04.240]   It's just living like you believe in Jesus.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:10.920]   Said otherwise, it's just believing in Jesus.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:17.520]   You grew up in a culture where if you claim the label as Christian, you are one.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.080]   That's what so many people I meet with believe.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.080]   I say, "Are you a Christian?"
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.080]   They say, "Yes."
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.080]   I present the gospel.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.360]   They say, "I don't know if I believe that."
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.480]   What makes you a Christian?
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.920]   You can't just say, "I'm a Christian," and become one.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.320]   That's like me saying I'm a doctor.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.200]   Where did you go to residency?
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.680]   I didn't do residency.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:38.680]   Where did you get your PhD?
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.880]   I don't have a PhD.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.880]   How are you a doctor?
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.800]   "Oh, my dad's a doctor.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.840]   His dad was a doctor, so I'm a doctor."
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.160]   How did you become a doctor?
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:54.240]   "Oh, you know, I go to the doctor a lot, so I'm a doctor."
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.200]   You can't just say you're a doctor and be one.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.980]   You can't just say you're a Christian and be one.
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.360]   That doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.680]   What makes you a Christian?
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.340]   You follow Christ.
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:08.600]   First and foremost, you trust in his provision of forgiveness for you through his act, not
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.780]   yours.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.800]   That in the greatest event in the history of the world, also the worst event in the
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.520]   history of the world, became the greatest event in the history of the world.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.480]   Christ died on a cross.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:22.200]   God in the flesh on a cross.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.240]   How did we miss it?
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:29.040]   That's so pivotal to Christianity that we would live every single day in light of that
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:36.480]   truth that Christ died for us, tortured and died for us, died as a payment for our sins,
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.560]   and went in the grave and defeated death.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.740]   God raised him from the dead.
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.860]   And so many of you here tonight, you're not a Christian.
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.960]   It's the most loving thing I can tell you.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.460]   If you are a Christian, you don't need to be offended by that.
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.460]   Awesome.
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:55.380]   Brothers and sisters, we'll be with you forever and ever and ever.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:59.480]   Some of you need to hear as boldly as I can say it, you're not a Christian.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.480]   You don't know Christ.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.060]   You have no relationship with him.
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.820]   Y'all don't talk.
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.820]   Y'all don't communicate.
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.100]   You don't feast on his word.
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:11.660]   And when you do, it's for the acceptance of people, not him.
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.980]   You don't know him.
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.900]   And the reason I tell you that so boldly is that can change right now.
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.980]   And I don't need a number.
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:26.100]   I'm not collecting stripes or trying to raise money for anything.
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:31.100]   I'm just saying the way that you become a Christian is you trust in an event that happened
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:37.580]   in history, that every boy you slept with, every terrible thing you've done, every porn
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:43.980]   that you looked at, every materialistic act you've made, every act of righteousness you've
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.840]   done because you think you're something special.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:51.260]   Every time you thought about yourself too much, went on Jesus on a cross.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.660]   You pay for it as a payment.
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.700]   God said, I love you and I don't want to punish you for your sin.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:01.080]   So I'll punish me for your sin so that I can be with you forever and ever and ever.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:09.260]   And so he got what you deserved and therefore you get what he deserves as a perfect God.
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.180]   You can change that right now.
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.700]   You can leave here as a Christian.
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:17.740]   I just think that would be a tremendous, by my estimate, about a thousand of you are not
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.740]   Christian here tonight.
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.660]   And that can change.
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:26.540]   That doesn't even account for those listening in other places.
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:33.680]   And I just think the world, the kingdom would be so much more incredible if that changed.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:38.960]   He says in verse 21, not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord will enter the kingdom of
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:45.460]   heaven, but only the one who does the will of my father who is in heaven.
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:49.640]   Many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.680]   name drive out demons and in your name before many miracles.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.680]   Then I will tell them plainly.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.440]   I never knew you away from me.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:01.840]   You evil doer.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.300]   He's talking about people who thought they knew him.
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.780]   That should be terrifying.
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:09.800]   He's talking about people who did religious acts in his name.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.320]   It says that's terrifying.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:17.700]   And he says, I don't know you.
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.440]   It's like, I know he's saying, I don't, you might've known me.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.080]   You might've heard of me, but I don't know you.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.200]   You're not, we're not friends.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.000]   You're not on the list.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.360]   It's like, there's people I know, right?
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.120]   That don't know me.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.480]   I can go to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:46.640]   I can walk up to one big, large white house and I can knock on the door and say, yes,
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.520]   I'm here to speak with one, Mr. Barack Obama.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.240]   And they're gonna say, what's your name?
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.200]   You say, Jonathan, if they hadn't shot me already.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.320]   And I'm gonna say, Jonathan Pakluta.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.720]   And they're gonna say, I'm sorry, Barack doesn't know you.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.720]   And I'm gonna say, well, I know him.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.800]   I mean, I know everything about him.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.360]   I know about his wife.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.160]   I know about, I know about his family.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:13.000]   I know about his job, his occupation.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.680]   I know some decisions he's made.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:15.680]   I know a lot.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:16.680]   I know about his values.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.000]   I know about his faith.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.800]   I know about so much about him.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.520]   But he doesn't know you.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:30.400]   You're part before we shoot you.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.760]   There are two types of people, my third point.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.680]   There are two types of people and only one has found the path.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:42.080]   Only one of those types of people has found the path.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.080]   And so let me say this.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.420]   I think that we mistakenly think, and this is where I want to turn that bouncer analogy
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:48.420]   a little bit.
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.420]   You ready?
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:53.940]   We mistakenly think that God wants to send people to hell, that God desires to keep people
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.020]   out of heaven.
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:58.100]   God does not want to keep you from heaven.
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.620]   God is begging and pleading with you into heaven right now.
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.020]   God does not want to send you to hell.
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.260]   He does not desire that.
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.260]   Show me in the scripture.
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.260]   Okay.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.260]   Lots of scriptures on that.
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:11.020]   I'll give you one, one of my favorites, second Peter three, verse nine.
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.460]   The Lord is not slow in keeping his promises as some understand slowness.
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:20.860]   Instead, he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.740]   repentance.
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:31.580]   And so here in Matthew chapter seven, Jesus contrast the father's will with religious
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.660]   deeds.
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:36.700]   He says, the one who gets to me is the one who has done the will of my father.
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:37.860]   What is the will of my father?
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:44.940]   The path that some people find few people find is to God by doing the father's will.
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.100]   And so the father's will ready, I'm going to give it to you.
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:53.940]   The father's will is that you would know him by trusting in his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.420]   Now what does it mean to trust in his son?
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.420]   Jesus Christ.
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.480]   It means not to trust in yourself, but to trust in Jesus.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:04.300]   You see this guy is before Jesus and he says, but Jesus, he doesn't say, but Jesus, you
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.980]   died on the cross for me.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:08.860]   But Jesus, you were God's son in the flesh.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.620]   He says, but Jesus, I prophesied in your name.
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:13.620]   I casted out demons in your name.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.340]   Did I not do so many spiritual things?
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.340]   Did I not?
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:20.620]   Did I, I, I, but Jesus, I, but I was good.
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:23.940]   I didn't even know you, man.
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:27.040]   Depart from me.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.080]   So you do the father's will.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:38.840]   You trust in his provision of his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:47.760]   The father's will is that you would not trust in yourself, but that you would trust in Jesus.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:54.720]   Not trusting in your works or abilities, but his work on the cross.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:06.160]   I was, um, the market man, stock market took a beating Thursday, Friday, Monday, today.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:11.840]   And so yesterday I called a financial advisor and I had planned to have this small account,
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.840]   very small.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.840]   I'm a pastor, small account.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:18.320]   And, uh, and so I just said, Hey, I want to, I want to shut that down.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.800]   And I was going to do that anyways, but this just reminded me too.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:27.520]   We had a conversation and, um, a part of our conversation, I'll just tell you real quick
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:33.520]   is, is, you know, he said, he said, Hey, if I knew what tomorrow would hold, then I would
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.220]   know how to invest.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.960]   And I just thought, how true is that for Christians?
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.800]   Like if we know that there's a heaven, then it seems like we would invest different, right?
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.840]   He says like, we're not going to invest here on the earth.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.640]   We're going to invest where we can enjoy those investments forever and ever and ever and
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.640]   ever.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.760]   And that's the only reason that we don't love people as we should, because we don't believe
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.760]   in God.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.360]   What's the only reason that we don't share our resources as we should, that we don't
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.760]   pursue the purity that he calls us to, that we don't pursue the sobriety that he calls
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.760]   us to.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.680]   It's because we love ourselves more than him.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.200]   And it's because we've hedged our bets.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:11.280]   We know of the idea of God, but we don't believe in him to the point where we believe and have
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.640]   our hearts fully around eternity, that we're going to be there forever and ever and ever.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:20.880]   We lose sight of that, so we do what we want.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.360]   And in the midst of closing this account, see, he was my, it was my brother opened this
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.200]   account and then he moved on.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.760]   He was a broker there and then he moved on.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.200]   And so it goes to this stranger who I don't know who's had it.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.200]   And so I'm closing this account.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.220]   And so it dawned on me, I'm never going to talk to this guy again, he's an older man.
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.120]   And so I just said, well, I've got to share the gospel with him.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.520]   So I said, Hey, can I, before I go, can I ask you two questions?
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:47.600]   And he said, sure, reluctantly.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:56.680]   And I said, well, between one and 10, 10 being certain and one being not so sure, how certain
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:01.260]   are you that you would go to heaven if you died today?
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:04.400]   And so let me ask you, cause we're here together, you know, a couple thousand of us.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:11.400]   So if you died today, between one and 10, 10 being certain and one being not so sure,
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.000]   how certain are you that you would go to heaven?
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.760]   And I want you to think of a number.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.360]   Like I want you to get a number in your head, write it down.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.480]   If that's helpful, put it in your phone between one and 10.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.300]   What's, you know, think of that number, get it squarely.
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.300]   Is it a nine?
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.600]   Well, I'm pretty sure.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.400]   Is it a five kind of coin toss?
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.400]   I don't know.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.440]   It depends on what kind is it.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.440]   Is it?
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.440]   I'm absolutely for sure.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.300]   100% certain I'm a 10.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.300]   Is it a one?
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.140]   I know I'm not.
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.140]   What's your number?
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.140]   Everybody have a number.
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.140]   Give me a head nod.
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:45.700]   I'm going to call up people, not nodding their heads.
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.420]   He said, surprisingly so.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.100]   He said a 10.
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:55.540]   This is the same question someone asked me 13 years ago.
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.540]   He said, I'm a 10.
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.540]   I'm certain.
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.540]   I'm sure.
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:59.540]   And I said, cool.
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.860]   You agreed to answer two questions.
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:01.860]   Second question.
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.900]   If you stand before God, then today, and he says, why should I let you in?
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:09.380]   What would you say?
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.260]   And he said, because I've been good.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:17.260]   And he said, because my good works have outweighed my bad.
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.260]   That's a false gospel.
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.380]   That's a false teaching.
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:22.900]   He's the product of false teaching.
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.060]   I suspected that.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.700]   He told me where he attended.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:31.100]   And so I asked these questions.
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.200]   And he said, because my good deeds.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:37.900]   He's this man, this section of Jesus's sermon was about this man.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:38.900]   I was that man.
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.980]   I said a seven because I've tried hard 13 years ago.
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.020]   I was this man.
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.020]   Some of you are this man.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.020]   You didn't say 10.
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.140]   One through nine is all the same.
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:52.420]   I have no assurance of salvation because I think it's somehow by my merit, not Christ's
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.100]   alone.
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.300]   People tell me all the time, they come up here and they say, you know, I'm a seven.
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.300]   And I say, why?
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.900]   And they say, because Jesus Christ died for my sins.
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.580]   And I say, did he die for 70% of your sins?
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.180]   They say no, a hundred percent of my sins.
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.220]   Well, then why are you a seven?
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:10.660]   Do you 70% believe that he died for a hundred percent of your sins?
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:14.180]   We have a math problem, right?
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.900]   Like some of us tonight, we have a math problem.
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:22.260]   Jesus Christ died for a hundred percent of your sins.
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:25.460]   All of them, everything you've done and will do.
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:28.820]   And you can trust in that right now.
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.860]   It's just like receiving a payment.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:37.020]   It's like receiving a ticket to heaven, a ticket that Christ purchased.
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.260]   And you can trust in that right now.
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:41.940]   And then you live here and you do the father's will like you've trusted in that.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.060]   See, we don't, we're not trying to change your behavior.
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:46.700]   We're not trying to change your investment strategy.
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:49.460]   We're trying to tell you what the future holds.
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.660]   Here's what the future holds.
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:54.620]   The sky's going to be opened up like a scroll and Christ is going to come back on a white
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:59.260]   horse with a big sword coming out of his mouth and a tattoo that says, king of king, Lord
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:00.260]   of Lords.
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.660]   And he's going to be looking for those who are fully his.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.660]   Then he's going to say, come into my kingdom.
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.660]   Well done good and faithful servant.
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:11.660]   And depart from me, I never knew you, but I wanted to.
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:15.100]   But I wanted to.
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.500]   We know what the future holds.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.180]   Why wouldn't we live like that's true?
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:25.180]   Why wouldn't you leave here tonight, wake up tomorrow and live like there's a heaven
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.420]   and a hell.
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:31.540]   And those that know Christ go to heaven and they don't just go to heaven.
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:36.540]   They walk with them here and they follow him here.
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:40.620]   And so in summary, there are two paths, but only one leads to paradise.
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:45.740]   There are two types of prophets, but one is a poser.
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:51.940]   And lastly, there are two types of people, but only one finds the path.
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:58.780]   I think that we think that Jesus is that bouncer that he's posted up here like big Luke trying
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:02.900]   to keep you out, checking the list and no, not today, big boy.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:03.900]   You're not coming in.
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:04.900]   No, no, ma'am.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:08.100]   I know what you've done.
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:12.980]   And like, like there's a party in here, but he's not letting you in.
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:18.580]   That's not who Jesus is a better picture, a better description of that reality of what
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:24.260]   Christ has done on the cross for your sins, because he knows how wicked you are and he's
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.860]   not waiting for you to get right.
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.380]   He makes you right.
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.340]   And so a better description is like the world has blown up.
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:36.380]   It is rotting and decaying and there's destruction and death and stench and the fragrance of
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.200]   evil all around you.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:43.780]   And Christ is standing at the bomb shelter saying, come in, come in once and for all,
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:44.780]   come in here.
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:45.780]   Safety's in here.
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.460]   I am the way, the truth and the life.
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.180]   No one gets to the father except through me, but come here.
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:54.860]   I've gone to great lengths to die for your sins.
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.260]   All of them come in.
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.820]   Would you please come in?
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.620]   Don't go in there.
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:00.700]   Don't go in there.
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.420]   There's death in there.
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:03.420]   Destruction in there.
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.420]   Evil in there.
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.420]   Wickedness in there.
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.420]   Hurting morning hangovers.
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:07.420]   Am I pregnant?
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.420]   Oh my gosh.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:09.420]   Don't go in there.
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.420]   He loves you.
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:11.420]   Wait, there's regret in there.
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:20.600]   There's sickness and death in there and disease in there.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.520]   Would you please come in here?
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:27.140]   That's a, I want, I desperately want to write your name down.
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:28.140]   Please come in here.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:31.920]   I want all of you, all of you.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.380]   And as you come in, he's like, no, no, go back and get more.
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.860]   Go back and bring more in with you.
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:38.860]   Go back out there.
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:42.140]   Bring others in with you.
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:45.420]   I want to know you.
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.300]   I want to walk with you.
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:59.740]   I want to be with you forever and ever and ever, not later, today.
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:02.500]   I want to be with you at work.
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.580]   I want to be with you in that relationship.
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:11.420]   I want to be with you when you're all alone and you feel all alone.
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:13.480]   I want to be with you.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:18.180]   You don't ever have to be all alone again.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.260]   I know what you did.
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.940]   I know what you've done.
[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:25.540]   I know what you will do.
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:31.980]   And I was whipped for it, tortured for it, stabbed for it.
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:36.060]   I carried a heavy piece of wood for it.
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:42.120]   They drove nails in my hands for it, nails in my feet for it.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:51.460]   I hung on a cross for it until I couldn't breathe for it because I love you.
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:46:00.900]   I did that because I love you and I want you to know me and the world is decaying and I
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:09.180]   am inviting you right now into the very narrow, small gate that few find.
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:10.580]   Would you enter with me?
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:19.140]   I'm going to pray now that you would and we're going to move to worshipping.
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:32.980]   Father, I pray we would sing songs with you now as your angels rejoice in heaven, as souls
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:53.620]   transfer from death to life.
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:47:16.420]   As you have your heads bowed, I've never done this before ever in nine years of preaching,
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:20.700]   but as you have your heads bowed, and I'm not going to call you on stage and you don't
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:25.180]   have to do anything but this one thing.
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:29.980]   If you know you've been running from God, if you know that you think that you know him
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:35.220]   but you don't, and you want to walk with him from this moment on for the rest of your life,
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:38.740]   would you just raise your hand?
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:39.740]   I'm overwhelmed.
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:40.740]   That's amazing.
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:41.740]   Keep them up.
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:42.740]   Keep them up as I pray.
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:43.740]   I'm serious.
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:50.340]   I'm going to pray for you with your hands raised and you don't have to worry about who
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:51.340]   sees you.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.340]   God sees you.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.180]   That's the amazing thing.
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.860]   God sees you.
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:58.860]   God sees you.
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:47:59.860]   He knows.
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.220]   He knows your heart.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:11.220]   Father, thank you for the truth of the gospel that changes hearts and lives.
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:16.900]   Lord, would you call us all into relationship with you?
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:22.660]   You do not delight even in the perishing of the wicked, you tell us.
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:26.700]   You don't want anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance.
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:32.900]   Father, you've purchased our way to you, not by our works but by the works of your son
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:33.900]   Jesus.
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:39.500]   Father, for all of my brothers and sisters with their hands raised, who raised their
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:45.540]   hand, God, would you just give them the courage to reach out to community, to others, to other
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.100]   Christians saying, "Hey, I need help.
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.460]   I want to walk with God.
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:53.580]   Like a dog, I keep doing some things I don't want to do."
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:59.740]   Would you let them know it's not about the morality but your perfection?
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:03.900]   Thank you for that provision.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:07.420]   In Christ's name.
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:12.460]   My young adult friends, I love you guys so much.
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:15.940]   I want God's very best for you.
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:23.860]   Would you trade in the boring, normal, stupid pursuit of pleasures on this earth to find
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:27.580]   real eternal pleasures with God?
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:32.260]   That frankly is pretty dang fun on this earth.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:39.580]   And if that sounds crazy to you, I'd love to just share my story or 150 volunteers that
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.340]   serve with us every week that are here.
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:43.980]   They have red shirts on.
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:48.420]   And so if you were here and you were one of those that raised your hand, and just there
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:54.460]   were hundreds of you, and I'm not making that up, and that was awesome.
[00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:57.780]   If you're one of them and we can serve you in any way, just find someone with a red shirt
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:58.780]   and just say, "Hey, I need help.
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:49:59.780]   I can't do this on my own."
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:00.780]   Because you can't, by the way.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:01.780]   You can't do it on your own.
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.260]   You were never meant to.
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:06.500]   And we would love to help you.
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.860]   There's going to be red shirts all up here and out there and everywhere.
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.540]   And they'd love to serve you in any way they can.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:16.460]   And if you're here and you know that you don't have community and you're looking for that
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:21.120]   and you're a girl, you can walk down this hallway and there's a room in there or over
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:24.180]   there right outside this hallway, there's a room of girls that are all in search of
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:26.460]   Christian relationships in the area.
[00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:29.300]   And if you're a guy, you can walk down this hallway right here.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:33.340]   And right outside this hallway is a room full of guys that are just saying, "Hey, I want
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:34.660]   to hear more about community."
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:37.140]   And our community team will be in there to talk to you about that.
[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:41.900]   Community is just meeting together on a consistent basis to know God and to make Him known in
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:43.340]   the context of fellowship with others.
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.740]   There's a lot of Christian-ese in there, I feel like, when I say it.
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.860]   So I don't say it often, but that's what it is.
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:52.580]   It's going deeper with other Christians, being known, knowing them.
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:56.140]   And so if we can serve you in any way, I know it's a heavy message tonight, but it's the
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:57.900]   gospel.
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:59.900]   Every way I know how to share it with you.
[00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:02.140]   And so if we can talk about that all, we'd be up here.
[00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:03.140]   We'd love to do that.
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:04.140]   I love you guys.
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:05.660]   Go in peace, love, and serve the Lord.
