[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.720]   - How we doing Porch?
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.040]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.960]   Man, it's so fun to be with you guys tonight.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.800]   My name is Garrett.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.620]   If we've never met before,
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.960]   I've been on staff at the Porch for the last five years.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.760]   Came in through the Watermark Residency Program,
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.760]   did some great years out in Fort Worth.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.960]   So shout out to my Fort Worth family
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.140]   and of course every other group that's invisible
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.180]   to the group here in Dallas.
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.680]   But we know all around the country
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.520]   and even around the world,
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.760]   people are tuning in tonight to be a part of this.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.600]   And now I'm serving with the Awakened Conference.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.900]   Anybody got an Awakened Conference ticket out there?
[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.980]   Man, this is gonna be the farthest reaching,
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.560]   we pray, event that we've ever done
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.680]   in the entire history of the Porch.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.080]   It's gonna be something special.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.080]   Hey, we're taking a break from our series tonight,
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.320]   before they were kings.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.000]   And we're gonna talk about one very, very specific topic.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.560]   So let me share a little mistake I made recently,
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.480]   very small, that will introduce this idea.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.000]   So mistake number one, I went to the grocery store.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.200]   Anybody else get really stressed by the grocery store?
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.040]   Just me?
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.080]   I mean, it gets to me, man.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.980]   I'm just gonna be real with you.
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.640]   I get stressed.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.320]   I feel like it takes too much time.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.680]   I got other things I wanna get back to doing.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.200]   Too many people, too many options.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.560]   And it just kinda gets to me, man.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.660]   It's a little quirk.
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.880]   So I get back to, but once my record was,
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.040]   when I was single, it was four months
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.580]   I went without even going to the grocery store.
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.640]   I was pretty proud of that.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.200]   I just, I ate out with friends, fasted,
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.440]   and I just don't love it.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.700]   So anyway, but my wife now, she works full time.
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.440]   We gotta split the domestic responsibilities.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.040]   So I gotta pull some weight around here
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.880]   and go to the grocery store.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.320]   So I'm there, and yogurt is on the list.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.060]   And I've already got my stuff in the cart and everything.
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.400]   And I go back to the yogurt,
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.320]   and I'm like, the options thing.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.260]   It is a yogurt avalanche back there.
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.680]   It is a bonanza.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.520]   I don't have another word.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.280]   But it was so much.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.580]   I'm just, I looked at the shelf,
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.840]   I was like, I just lost the will to live.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.760]   I'm like, just give me a yogurt.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.740]   So I grabbed one that said nonfat plain.
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.120]   See?
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.200]   I don't know why you didn't tell me.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.960]   You guys should come shop with me.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.560]   So I grabbed that, and I was thinking,
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.960]   you know what, I recognize the name on the outside.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.840]   I'm gonna put some fruit and granola around this.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.780]   You know, it's gonna be all right.
[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.040]   Let me tell you this.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.920]   It was not all right.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.260]   It wasn't even the neighborhood of all right.
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.200]   You know what it was?
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.600]   It was not even yogurt anymore.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.440]   All right?
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.700]   Here's where I learned a very important lesson.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.980]   If you lose the flavor and you lose the fat,
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.140]   you've lost the yogurt.
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.700]   You now have sour cream, all right?
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.540]   That's what you have.
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.200]   It's so nasty.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.340]   And so I realized, we changed so much
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.100]   of what's essential about this,
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.500]   that now it seems like we've even changed the whole thing,
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.060]   which is a pretty transferable idea.
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.900]   I mean, think about this.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.720]   Isn't this true?
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.720]   If you lose enough parts, you eventually lose the whole.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.420]   Eventually, if you lose enough of the essential parts
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.780]   of one thing, anything, you eventually will lose the whole,
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.860]   the entire thing.
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.200]   This can happen with a job.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.460]   Some of you, you had a job and you loved it.
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.620]   And then what happened was you got a new boss,
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.540]   and then the new boss had new ideas.
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.980]   And then all the people you love
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.620]   started to go work somewhere else.
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.660]   And you look up and you realize one little change at a time,
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.080]   and you go, hey, I think I lost the job I love,
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.080]   not because I got fired or went somewhere else,
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.600]   but because they changed it one little step at a time.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.480]   And now I can't even recognize my own job anymore.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.720]   It's completely changed.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.640]   It's completely gone.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.340]   This can happen in a relationship.
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.680]   You can be dating someone, and then all of a sudden,
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.340]   you start losing the quality time of the relationship,
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.400]   which is an important part.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.520]   And then it goes another step,
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.640]   and you lose the kindness and the good tone,
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.520]   you know what I mean?
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.060]   The mutual respect of the relationship.
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.380]   And then you might go another step,
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.500]   and all of a sudden, maybe you look up
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.460]   and you even lost the faithfulness of the relationship,
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.980]   and you look up and go, who are we kidding?
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.940]   It doesn't even feel like we have a relationship at all.
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.060]   Because eventually, if you take out
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.140]   enough of the essential parts of anything,
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.140]   you change the entire thing.
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.260]   You can't just endlessly reduce something
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.460]   and still have something.
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.320]   Some of you may have experienced this at a very young age
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.860]   where your family, your mom and dad,
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.700]   who were married at the time, sat you down
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.140]   and explained to you why mom and dad
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.360]   were no longer gonna live in the same place,
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.060]   but you were still going to be a family.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.060]   And even at six or eight or 10 years old,
[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.780]   you wouldn't have known to put it into these words,
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.740]   but the truth is, you knew, you knew.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.340]   Like, look, if you live there and you live,
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.940]   I mean, are we really a family?
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.320]   It feels like it's changed so much
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.860]   that if you, at some point, lose enough of the parts,
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.100]   we really have changed the whole thing.
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.720]   And what I wanna declare and talk about
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.580]   a little bit tonight is the fact
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.760]   that this can even happen to the church.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.220]   Church can be changed one little part at a time,
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.420]   one biblical part removed at a time,
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.160]   until all of a sudden the drift is so far
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.460]   that you don't even have anything resembling
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.460]   a biblical church anymore.
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.700]   So what I'd love to do tonight
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.900]   is I would love to share three things
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.500]   that you can't lose and still be the church,
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.060]   three things that you cannot lose.
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.020]   If you lose them, you're no longer the church,
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.180]   you're something else or really close to it.
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.380]   Three essential ingredients, all right,
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.560]   that if you lose these parts,
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.680]   you really are flirting with corrupting the whole thing.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.620]   Now, I picked a risky topic tonight, and here's why.
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.820]   Most of you are not walking around,
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.180]   driving around, living around, thinking,
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.620]   you know what I need to hear about tonight?
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.260]   I need to hear about some church essentials,
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.300]   you know, somebody give 'em to me.
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.620]   That's not what we typically think about.
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.840]   We typically are reacting to our needs in life, you know?
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.300]   We typically think, you know what, I gotta get a job.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.340]   You know what, I gotta get a better job.
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.660]   You know what, I gotta convince someone
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.220]   to spend the rest of their life with me.
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.060]   What am I doing?
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.340]   You know, like we typically don't walk around
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.440]   consumed with, you know what, I need to know,
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.340]   what would a biblical church be, you know?
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.100]   And it's just not the terms we think in.
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.840]   And we know that statistically at least,
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.180]   about half of you is our best guess,
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.340]   are already committed to a local church.
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.180]   You're part of a church.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.020]   You know what a biblical church is,
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.900]   either here or somewhere else.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.580]   And it's my hope tonight that the things that we discuss
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.580]   would just encourage you to keep chasing
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.620]   what you're already chasing.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.620]   But I also know that for the other half of you,
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.180]   I have no idea, I am shooting into the dark tonight.
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.080]   I have no idea what your relationship with church is.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.840]   Some of you might say, none, I'm just busy,
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.940]   so I just kinda drop in every once in a while, podcast.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.420]   It's a casual relationship, you know what I mean?
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.140]   Some of you would say it's more complicated.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.460]   It's complicated, that's my relationship with church.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.540]   It's complicated.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.060]   Maybe someone even, maybe you have church pain, you know?
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.820]   Maybe from your background at some point,
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.800]   it was hard for you to even come in here tonight.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.620]   Maybe the last time you were in a room like this
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.580]   and heard someone sing and you heard someone talk,
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.060]   maybe someone who I remind you of for whatever reason,
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.020]   like put on a microphone and said something hurtful.
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.940]   Maybe when you look at church, you think, you know what,
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.140]   I don't really have a problem with what's going on there.
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.140]   I just don't know if I can believe it.
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.020]   You know, intellectual credibility, man.
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.540]   Like I don't really know if I can believe everything.
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.300]   So I have no idea for the half of you,
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.260]   some of you are like, man,
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.380]   somebody invited me to the porch.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.540]   I thought he was inviting me to his house.
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.600]   I'm like, where am I right now?
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.660]   Some of you, you know, totally caught off guard.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.580]   But whatever your relationship is with church tonight,
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.100]   the reason I wanna put these in front of you
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.580]   is because of the way God changed my life
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.900]   through the church.
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.540]   See, my relationship with church was when I grew up,
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.440]   I went to church some.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.820]   I was there Christmas and Easter.
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.540]   We were in a very small town in Texas,
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.660]   very conservative culture.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.320]   My mom had a little tattoo on her ankle.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.040]   She would put a bandaid over that tattoo on the ankle
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.940]   because, you know, small town church,
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.180]   it gets a little tight in there.
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.820]   So she'd been divorced several times, you know,
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.520]   she'd had three kids, but three dads,
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.900]   and I was the middle kid.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.100]   And so we were just a little bit
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.140]   on the outskirts of the village, you know?
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.400]   And we went to church some,
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.860]   and I came to the conclusion by the time
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.340]   I was about 14 or 15,
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.460]   that church was the main source of boredom in the world.
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.560]   All right, I mean, that's where I was.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.400]   That's where I lived.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.680]   There were more interesting things to do, you know?
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.800]   And all of a sudden, I just ran down as far as I could
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.800]   a path of promiscuity, partying, pornography addiction,
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.400]   and addiction to self.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.480]   Narcissism is the only way I can say it.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.500]   I just completely pursued anything I wanted to do.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.800]   I was a hedonist, you know?
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.440]   It just means I sought pleasure.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.800]   Whatever was fun, that's what I did.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.080]   And all of a sudden, I looked up at 18, 19 years old,
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.260]   and I realized this is not fun anymore.
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.220]   My life is broken.
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.380]   I'm sick and tired of the hangovers.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.900]   I'm tired of drama-filled relationships.
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.620]   You ever been in a drama-filled relationship?
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.500]   Oh my goodness.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.580]   So I'm tired.
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.100]   I'm tired of pregnancy scares.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.060]   I'm tired of guilt.
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.020]   I'm tired of shame.
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.980]   And all of a sudden,
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.000]   I had been at the world's carnival away from church,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.840]   and then all of a sudden,
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.380]   the rides started to make me sick.
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.540]   And I was tired.
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.780]   And I found out that there wasn't life there anymore.
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.780]   And what happened to me was God showed me
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.600]   that the one I had heard about my whole life,
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.040]   the one who got on a cross for me,
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.520]   the one who had come out of a tomb for me,
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.600]   that's Jesus, paid for everything,
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.480]   knowing in advance that I was going to do that,
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.960]   that I was gonna run that far.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.120]   And then when he enlightened my eyes to see that,
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.200]   he didn't just give me a heaven to be saved to,
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.080]   he gave me a people to belong to.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.440]   And so what I'd love to share with you tonight
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.340]   is if you're on that end where you say,
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.980]   I don't really want a formal relationship with church,
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.460]   that's not really my favorite thing,
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.300]   I would just say,
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.060]   I hope that something that is shared tonight
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.820]   would be as attractive to you as the church became to me
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.620]   when my life started finally to change.
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.420]   So three things tonight that you can't lose
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.260]   if you're still gonna be the church.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.980]   I picked these three, okay?
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.580]   So there's the greatest weakness of this message.
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.660]   And some of you are like,
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.500]   going through the Bible,
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.500]   looking for this list of three,
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.340]   you won't find it.
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.980]   It's not like Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus.
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.420]   Three things you must be in order to still be the church.
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.660]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.020]   But I picked these three for a specific reason.
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.340]   It's because I think these are the three
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.140]   that are most popularly abandoned in our day to day.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.540]   The three things that I think are most popularly abandoned
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.520]   that will make us cease to be the church.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.720]   Here they are, I'm gonna give them to you in order,
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.560]   and then we'll go.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.420]   Number one, authentic connection with other Christians.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.180]   Number two, willingness to be counter-cultural.
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.480]   And number three, the urgency in the mission of Jesus.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.780]   We'll take those slower as we go.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.860]   First, authentic connection with other Christians.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.220]   What does that mean?
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.260]   It means they know you and you know them.
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.980]   Not just you are near them and they are near you.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.340]   That is so different.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.380]   Did you know that you can be in close proximity,
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.660]   of course, some of you are in a city and you're lonely.
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.280]   How could you be lonely in a city?
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.120]   The math doesn't work.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.120]   There's more people in the city.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.660]   You should be more connected than ever.
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.140]   But somehow it's possible to be lonely in a city
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.980]   because you can be close to a person,
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.980]   but not close to a person.
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:00.860]   And they don't know you.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.780]   They don't know what your fears are.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.700]   They don't know what your doubts are.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.220]   They don't know what your insecurities are.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.580]   They don't know what your tendencies are.
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.580]   They don't know where you're prone to leave the God
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.780]   that you love or hope to love.
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.840]   They don't know your weaknesses.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.680]   They don't know your strengths.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.760]   All of a sudden, there's a surface level social game
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.560]   that's going on as we all just kind of remain
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.020]   on the surface of life.
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.260]   And what happens in a real church,
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.300]   in a place where the scripture is being pursued,
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.920]   is that you have an authentic connection
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.760]   with other Christians.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.580]   This happened to me, man.
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.060]   I remember the first time this happened.
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.780]   I had been living the life I just described.
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.180]   All of a sudden, a dude invites me to a small group.
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.300]   I was like, I don't know what this,
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.300]   well, I don't know what this group that is small is,
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.260]   but I will show up, whatever.
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.480]   So I showed up, and all of a sudden,
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.140]   this dude opens up with the line,
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.580]   hey, these are, okay, let me set the stage
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.660]   a little more clearly.
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.920]   This is eight college dudes, nobody else, all right?
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.460]   Eight college dudes.
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.740]   And this dude breaks off with,
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.560]   "Hey guys, I just wanna confess masturbation to you guys.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.580]   "And yeah, that was a part of my week.
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.480]   "All right, let me be more real.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.020]   "It actually happened twice."
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.380]   And that's what he started in on.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.220]   And I had no idea what he was doing.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.860]   I was like, you're not even gonna warm up to it, man.
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.780]   You're not even gonna get to,
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.060]   we're not gonna get to know each other.
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:16.500]   It was weird.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.340]   And all of a sudden, they started to go around the circle.
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.740]   And I realized, what they're trying to do
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.740]   is they're trying to follow Jesus together.
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.940]   That's all they're trying to do.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:29.880]   What they're trying to do is they're trying
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.960]   to be honest with each other.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.480]   They're trying to authentically confess to one another.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.400]   They're trying to be known by one another.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.880]   That's the goal here.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.880]   You know how sometimes you can tell
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.080]   some people don't wanna be known?
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.760]   That's why the average length of conversation is very short.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.280]   Because at some point, a few seconds in,
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.400]   you gotta make a decision about whether you're gonna be
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.960]   in or out on the conversation.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.280]   And all of a sudden, I realized,
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.120]   for the first time in my life,
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.540]   I am around people committed to depth in church.
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:57.940]   This amazed me.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.120]   I had never seen that before.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.320]   I thought church was full of hypocrites, you know,
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.280]   and full of people pretending to be perfect.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.400]   And those dudes, for sure,
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.360]   were not pretending to be perfect.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.180]   I can tell you that.
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.360]   They made that abundantly clear right at the start.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.640]   And they were just being honest.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.560]   I had been around nothing but college baseball locker rooms,
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.920]   and I only had friends who were exactly like me.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.320]   And I just, it was a mundane world
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.600]   of surface-level conversation.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.240]   And the drunk, "I love you, man,"
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.240]   had nothing on the depth that I saw amongst these people.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.260]   And I wanted it.
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.900]   It's normal.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.620]   It's normal, biblically,
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.740]   that if you're gonna be the church,
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.220]   you're gonna have to get below the surface.
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.220]   You're gonna have to be honest.
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.520]   You're gonna have to let yourself be known
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.620]   for where you're strong and also where you're weak.
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.500]   Here it is from the scripture, Hebrews 3:13.
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.700]   "Exhort one another,"
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.860]   this is a fascinating verse, by the way.
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:47.680]   I love this verse.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.780]   "Exhort one another every day, as long as it's called today,
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.200]   so that none of you may be hardened
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.680]   by the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.520]   All right, let's look at this.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.120]   There's a problem and a solution.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.880]   The problem is,
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.400]   none of you would be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.720]   That's the problem, deceitfulness of sin,
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.560]   deceitfulness of sin.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.200]   What is the deceitfulness of sin?
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.520]   It's that you would do wrong and not care.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.440]   It's that you would do wrong from yourself,
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.640]   you know, not because of some circumstance forced you,
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.240]   but like out of you, like there's a brokenness in you,
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.520]   a prone to wander in you.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.100]   And you would actually do wrong from yourself,
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.420]   maybe for yourself, and you would think to yourself,
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.700]   "That doesn't really affect myself."
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.580]   That's the deceitfulness of sin,
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.140]   that you just do whatever you want
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.700]   and be completely ignorant of the fact
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.200]   that you are hardening your own heart against God
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.140]   and maybe ruining your life.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.300]   That's what the problem is.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.540]   That's a very individual problem, you know what I mean?
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.680]   Individual problem.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.260]   But look at the solution he gave right at the start.
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.500]   "But exhort," what?
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.340]   "One another."
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.640]   He just gave a group solution to our individual problem.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.320]   There's no person you've ever met
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.440]   who doesn't have that individual problem,
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.040]   the tendency to sin, the tendency to the wrong.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.760]   Doesn't mean they're as bad as they could be,
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.680]   it just means they're not as good as they should be.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.720]   Does that make sense?
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.440]   And the truth is, is that we need one another.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.680]   Christianity is a team sport, it always has been.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.200]   Man, people get really creative
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.120]   in the ways they talk themselves out of this.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.580]   I just wanna tell you that.
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.060]   People get so creative when they don't wanna be known
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.460]   or they don't wanna be a part of a church.
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.740]   I was sharing the gospel with a guy a couple months ago,
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.740]   his name was Jeff.
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.780]   He was a really nice guy, he seemed super open.
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.220]   So I went to the conversation and I said,
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.000]   "Hey Jeff, let me take a turn in the conversation, man.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.420]   "Do you have a faith?"
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.080]   And he said, "Yeah man, I'm a Christian."
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.580]   He was ready, boy, he was ready.
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.420]   I said, "That's great, man.
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.620]   "Well, let me ask you this, Jeff.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.760]   "If that dude over there came up to you and said,
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.200]   "Jeff, I heard you're a Christian.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.480]   "I wanna go to heaven, man, what I gotta do?
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.340]   "What would you say?"
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.940]   And he said, "I would tell him by grace through faith,
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.920]   "alone in the cross of Jesus Christ, alone."
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.940]   I mean, he was ready.
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.920]   I was like, "Dude, this brother needs to preach."
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.060]   But I didn't tell him that.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.820]   Instead, I said, "Okay, Jeff, one more question.
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.420]   "Go one more with me.
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.020]   "What church are you a part of?"
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.700]   He got real passionate.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.020]   He was like, "Oh, you know what?
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.120]   "I don't even need a church.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:09.960]   "You know what?
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.240]   "I mean, man, I don't have to go to church
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.140]   "to be a Christian."
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.420]   And he started, I mean, he gave me like eight objections.
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.420]   It was almost like he was more ready for me to ask that.
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.620]   And his big like landing point, this was fun.
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.440]   He said, "You know, Jesus said,
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.420]   "where two or three are gathered, there I am among them."
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.360]   I said, "That's great, Jeff.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.420]   "Who are you, two or three?"
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.540]   He said, "I got my roommate, but he's an atheist."
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.980]   I said, "That's bad math, Jeff."
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:33.980]   All right, that's not gonna work, all right?
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.600]   We get so creative when we wanna talk ourselves out of it.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.380]   Let's just do a little call and response right quick.
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.220]   All right, let me tell you.
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.600]   Here's some objections I've heard.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.060]   These are direct from people, all right?
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.300]   This is a real thing.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.320]   I'm not making fun of anybody up here.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.540]   Much, but I wanna just tell you,
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.380]   these are the responses that you get, okay?
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.220]   I've heard people say,
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.580]   "I don't need to go to church to be a Christian."
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.420]   You heard that?
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.580]   "I don't need to go to church to be a Christian."
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.700]   Right, kind of like I don't need to go home to be married.
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.140]   Okay, the answer is that's probably not gonna work long.
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:02.980]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.900]   Like it's just not gonna go very far for very long.
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.060]   It doesn't, here's one.
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.700]   People at church are as messed up as me.
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:09.700]   Great, you'll fit right in.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.540]   It's gonna be amazing.
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.360]   You can meet all your friends.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.100]   (congregation laughing)
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.180]   I love this.
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.360]   I don't need an organization.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.860]   I can change the world on my own.
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.260]   Awesome, how's that going for you?
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.100]   Where'd you change the world?
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.280]   What'd you do?
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.660]   You can't do it alone.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.500]   That's the truth.
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.000]   Some dudes get super spiritual with it.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.840]   I love this.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.320]   Have you ever heard somebody use the term Big C Church?
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.560]   You ever heard that term?
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.900]   Big C Church, here's what it means.
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.180]   It means the global church,
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.880]   all believers in all places, all over the earth,
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.020]   every nation, you know?
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.040]   And so some dudes will go theological with this
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.380]   and they'll say,
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.580]   "You know what?
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.820]   "I'm a Big C Church guy.
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.960]   "I love the whole church, you know, global.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.780]   "So I don't really wanna commit to any specific one."
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.460]   Okay.
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.860]   Ladies, if you were with a man.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:01.700]   I feel like I don't even need to finish this right now.
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.220]   I will.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.320]   And he says,
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:12.140]   "You know, I'm kind of a Big W women guy.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.380]   "Global women, all women.
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.820]   "So I don't really feel the need to commit myself,
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.340]   "you know, with all of my gifts
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.980]   "to any little W woman specifically."
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.580]   Leave, all right?
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.940]   You're like, that is the most unhealthy.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.780]   You'd be like,
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.500]   "You got some psychological issues is what you have."
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.340]   All right?
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.260]   That's the fact of the matter.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.460]   And so it just doesn't make sense.
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.300]   Let me just be honest with you.
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.560]   It just doesn't make sense to be like,
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.660]   "I'm so into the global movement of Jesus
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.140]   "that I can't commit to the local movement of Jesus."
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.380]   You can't add, okay?
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.700]   Like that doesn't work, all right?
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.200]   You have to be able to do this.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.080]   Christianity is a team sport.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.000]   It always has been.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.740]   And the team is the local church.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.500]   Why do we talk ourselves out of being on the team
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.140]   that we claim to be on?
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:57.980]   It doesn't even make sense.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.180]   It's normal to have, if you're a believer in Christ,
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.540]   to be the church, you must be a part of a church.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.460]   An imperfect place, you'll fit right in,
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.700]   show up, be a part of it, and get engaged, all right?
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.560]   Number two, a willingness to be counter-cultural.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.940]   Changing gears completely.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.420]   A willingness to be counter-cultural.
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.980]   This is essential if we want to be the church.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.180]   Or if you change your mind about wanting one,
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.740]   this is something you should look for.
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.740]   A willingness to be counter-cultural.
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:30.740]   Now, what do I mean by this?
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.900]   Counter means against.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:32.740]   That's all it means.
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.260]   So you have to be willing to go against
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.620]   popular culture sometimes.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.180]   Kind of works like this.
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.020]   Summer's coming up.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.740]   We got any lazy river people in here?
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.780]   Lazy river people, looking forward to it?
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.300]   Man, you guys are hard workers.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.300]   I'm looking forward to the lazy river myself.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.940]   The lazy river is a place where you go without any effort.
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.660]   It's a place where you and everybody else,
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.020]   there is no freedom of thought.
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.980]   There is no, it is we are going, all right?
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.620]   And there's not a lot of force involved.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.660]   It's just, you know, hands off.
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.420]   Popular culture is like that.
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.940]   You don't have to do any effort.
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.380]   You can just go.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.500]   Path of least resistance.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.500]   And then, you may remember at some point when you were a kid
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.860]   you get out of the lazy river and you decide
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.700]   you're gonna run uphill just to see how hard it is.
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.420]   And you realize it's really hard
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.100]   and it kind of upsets the people, all right?
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.500]   And so it is frustrating to those as you walk upstream
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.500]   and it takes a lot of effort and you realize
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.940]   how much force is actually in your face.
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.660]   At some point, being a Christian will feel like that.
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:36.020]   At some point, you will feel a sense of disagreement
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.420]   with the culture around you.
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.340]   Not because you wanna be disagreeable.
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.940]   Not because you wanna be a know-it-all.
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.580]   Not because you wanna be argumentative.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.380]   And by the way, let me put that boundary in place.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.380]   I didn't say an eagerness to be counter-cultural.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.220]   That's not Christian.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.260]   You don't wanna be argumentative.
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.540]   You don't wanna be combative.
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.460]   That's not the point.
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.900]   You don't wanna just turn around in the lazy river
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:53.820]   and splash for no reason.
[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:54.660]   That just doesn't make any sense.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.080]   It's gonna upset the people, all right?
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.340]   But what you have to do is be willing
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.540]   to humbly and gently walk with Jesus
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.940]   even when the rest of the world is in conflict
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.340]   with your choice or with your belief.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.300]   That's just a normal part of Christianity.
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.740]   In fact, at one point in the scripture,
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.620]   the Bible calls you in exile.
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.460]   Did you know that?
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.500]   If you happen to be a believer in Christ,
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.580]   exile means you have been exiled, okay?
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.680]   Like you are not a part of the rest of the people.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.380]   You are different.
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.780]   And that's a normal part of being a Christian.
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.940]   Jesus did counter-cultural things all the time.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.900]   And I just wanna be more clear
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.140]   about what I mean by counter-cultural.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.740]   I know some people, like going against the grain
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.700]   means something like, you mean like you have a wedding
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.140]   and don't have a hashtag, you know?
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:35.980]   Like, no.
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.820]   I mean like in some more meaningful way.
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.220]   Like, you run a marathon and don't tell anybody?
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.160]   That would be crazy.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.000]   That would be crazy.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.820]   Somebody should definitely do that.
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.100]   I've never heard of that at all.
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.740]   But I mean in some meaningful ways
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.060]   that you would be willing to go against culture.
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.020]   Jesus did this all the time.
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.660]   Think about some things Jesus said.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.480]   Let me summarize.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.000]   He told rich people it would be hard for them.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.680]   Everybody knows it's easy for rich people, right?
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.540]   He told rich people it'd be hard for them to go to heaven.
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.300]   He showed women they were important
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.100]   at a time when not many believed that.
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:12.220]   He told men they couldn't divorce their wives for no reason
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.820]   at a time when not many believed that.
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.900]   He told leaders to act like slaves of their people.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.820]   Nobody did that.
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.220]   He told people to pay their taxes
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.620]   even though the government was corrupt.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.300]   He invited white-collar criminals to become his followers.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.260]   This is my favorite one.
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.780]   He told religious leaders that they were the devil's kids.
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:34.060]   Literally, quote, "You are of your father, the devil,"
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:34.980]   end quote.
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.920]   It's right there in John chapter eight.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.340]   Jesus, if you're watching this,
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.620]   at some point you lean over to your friend
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.460]   and you just say, "I don't think he cares what we think.
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.020]   "I think he is totally free from what we think."
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.320]   And in fact, that actually happened.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.780]   In Mark chapter 12, it says,
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:51.900]   "And they came and said to him,
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.860]   "Teacher, we know that you are true
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.580]   "and do not care about anyone's opinion,
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.320]   "for you are not swayed by appearances,
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.860]   "but you truly teach the way of God."
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.420]   And I just wonder, could anyone say that about you, truly?
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.620]   Could anyone accurately say to you,
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.140]   if you claim to be a part, if you don't,
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.940]   this question wouldn't even make sense,
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.700]   but if you claim to be a follower of Jesus,
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:17.380]   could people say that your way of life
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.880]   is fully independent from the approval of people?
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.660]   Could people say that you're an independent thinker?
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.380]   Could people say that you're firm enough
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.140]   to go wherever Jesus goes?
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.780]   Could they say that accurately of your life?
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.020]   You will feel the resistance at times.
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.740]   Some of you feel it when you decide to stop sleeping
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.100]   with the person you're dating out of honor for Jesus,
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.340]   and they look at you like you are from another world.
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.700]   Or all of a sudden, you're the person in the office.
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.460]   You come into a relationship with Christ,
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:49.940]   and all of a sudden, you're the person in the office
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.900]   who wants to honor the boss who no one likes,
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.460]   and everyone is mystified,
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:57.740]   because you honor the boss who is not honorable,
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.380]   and they look at you like you're from
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.300]   a complete other world.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.980]   Or when you stop partying, and you go,
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.040]   "Look, if I have to find new friends, I find new friends,
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.580]   "but I can't go back to that same place."
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.780]   And all of a sudden, people look at you
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:10.620]   like you're from another world.
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.380]   They're doing that because now you are,
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.060]   and you're gonna notice that sometimes
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.380]   if you choose to follow Jesus.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.380]   It's normal to have to be willing at times
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.260]   to go against the grain of culture.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.300]   Number three, urgency in the mission of Jesus.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.760]   If you wanna be the church,
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.180]   or if you wanna find one at any point,
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.700]   you're gonna need to find people,
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.420]   or be a person who is urgent in your personal mission.
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.780]   If you wanna see the mission God gave
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.260]   every single one of us, it's in Matthew 28, 19 to 20.
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.080]   It goes like this.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.260]   This is the words of Jesus.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.960]   Go, very famous words.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.780]   Go, therefore, you're like, "Go where?"
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:47.920]   It says to all nations.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.980]   Well, that includes this one.
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.620]   So like, go to work and make disciples.
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.060]   Go to your friend and make disciples.
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.460]   Go to your family and make disciples.
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.860]   Some of you like to get a little creative,
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.620]   and you're like, "Can I go to the bar and make disciples?"
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.940]   No, it's not gonna help you, all right?
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.980]   Go to the people you can go to
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.900]   and lead them in such a way that they fall in love
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.560]   with the way of Christ because they read your life.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.180]   What it means to make, you're like, "Make disciples."
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.020]   What does that mean?
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:16.840]   Here's what it means.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.940]   It means to be so in love with Jesus
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:23.940]   that you can't help but love your friends so much
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:27.360]   that you try to connect them to him.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.520]   That's all make disciples is.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.340]   It's to love Jesus so much that you can't help
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.620]   but wanna take your people, your friends,
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.860]   your relationships, the people God has put in front of you
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.380]   and to actually lead them toward the one
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.680]   who is total fulfillment and total satisfaction
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.300]   and total joy.
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.780]   That's what it means to make disciples.
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.100]   It means, you can call it evangelism, share the gospel.
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.140]   You can call it outreach, serve the poor.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.580]   You can call it anything you want.
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:56.420]   It is loving people so much that you must bring them
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.440]   to the one who is love.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.960]   And I just wanna say, the first time this starts
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.040]   to happen to you, it is a little nerve-wracking.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.840]   Let me tell you, this is the first time in my life,
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.600]   a specific moment when I actually wanted
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.800]   to try to make a disciple.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.620]   I wouldn't have called it that.
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.280]   I just would have said I wanted to help my friend.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.120]   But here's what happened.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.320]   We were in college and we were both working retail.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.920]   I did not go to college in order to work at Men's Warehouse,
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.360]   but I ended up there because that's where I could get a job.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.160]   So there I was.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.960]   And me and my friend, we were working,
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.880]   and I had left the party scene about six months prior.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.700]   So I mean, I was like fresh out of the world,
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.480]   just trying to follow Jesus for the very first time.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.860]   And this dude was completely still entrenched in everything.
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:41.760]   And his joy was very fragile, just like mine had been.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.840]   I knew right where he was.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.280]   He would come to work, he was moody, he was tired,
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.000]   he was frustrated.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.040]   It was the highest of highs and lowest of lows,
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.160]   usually the lows.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.760]   And he was just kind of wearing himself out.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.280]   He always seemed to be on the verge
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.800]   of really wrecking his life.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.920]   And I knew what that was 'cause I had been there,
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.240]   and my heart just broke for him.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.800]   And one day he was in a low, low valley,
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.720]   and we were closing up shop.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.760]   And we were standing up front at the registers.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.280]   And I could just see he was tired, he was hungover.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.800]   I could tell he had a headache, dehydrated, disoriented,
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.800]   you know what I mean, just the whole deal, man.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.520]   And I saw him, and it was just so fresh in my memory
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.240]   what that had felt like.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.960]   And so I just realized my heart starts racing.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.160]   I'm like, I think God's telling me to talk to this dude.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.480]   I was not a pastor.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.840]   I had no reps, I had no nothing.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.280]   I just had, I love this dude, I don't know what to say.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.580]   It's one college dude talking to another.
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:32.420]   That's all I had.
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.800]   And so all of a sudden my heart's kind of racing,
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.800]   and I'm like, if I don't talk to this dude,
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:36.840]   God's gonna keep me up all night.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.640]   You know, like I gotta say something.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.960]   I didn't have any words.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.660]   And so what happened was I just said, hey man,
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:47.320]   not making this up, hey man,
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.840]   I'm afraid that if you keep doing this,
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.520]   history's gonna kind of keep repeating itself,
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.720]   and I just think there's a better way.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.080]   And he knew I was a Christian, so he, you know,
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.600]   it wasn't exactly we shared the gospel
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.700]   and he got baptized on the spot,
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.160]   but it was my first time, okay, you know,
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.560]   I didn't have, it was the best I could do.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.880]   But he knew exactly what I was referring to, you know?
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.000]   And so I said it and kind of stopped, looked at the ground.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.760]   And after you do that for the first time, you're like,
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.960]   is my friendship with this dude over?
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.440]   Is he about to, you know, hit me in the face?
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.340]   Like, what is about to happen?
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.360]   Like, you're so nervous, like, it's not normal, you know?
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.320]   You're like, what did I just do?
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.960]   Oh my gosh, am I the crazy guy with a sign on the street
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.360]   who's saying, you know, you don't know,
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.360]   it's like an out of body experience, it's so weird.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.920]   And so all of a sudden I like,
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.000]   I waited and I just said that and he goes,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.840]   thanks man, I appreciate that.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.660]   And that was it.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.400]   And I went to my car and I was like, okay, you know,
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.960]   it was so bizarre, you know?
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.440]   And some of you have, you know,
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.340]   you don't know what that feels like
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.280]   because you've never reached out to a friend
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.600]   to actually try to be a friend.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.740]   Some of you, you share the gospel everywhere you go
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.020]   and you remember that first time where you're like,
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.900]   oh my gosh, they're gonna think I'm crazy, you know,
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.980]   they're never gonna talk to me again.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.420]   And the truth is they might feel your love coming across
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.340]   because that's what it really is, right?
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.060]   And I just wanna tell you,
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.220]   if you haven't felt that before,
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.820]   it's so freeing to love someone so much
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.180]   that you no longer care what they think of you.
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.340]   And if you think you're a friend,
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:12.820]   but you care more about someone's opinion than their soul,
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.140]   you are no friend, is the truth.
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.740]   And so urgency in the mission of Jesus is part of it, man.
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.200]   That's part of the deal.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.040]   If you love him, if you know him,
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.520]   and you know he loved you first,
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.260]   then it is unavoidable that if you wanna be the church,
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.860]   a sense of urgency for the people around you,
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:30.900]   you can't force them.
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.940]   Let me just say that, you know, you can't force anybody,
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.220]   you don't need to force anybody.
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.780]   Don't preach, you know, don't like go home to your roommate
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.780]   and be like, I've been waiting, you know?
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.260]   Like don't go in and like,
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.660]   don't go unload on your roommate.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:42.700]   Like that's not the point.
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.620]   It is something to propose, okay?
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.100]   It's not something to impose, okay?
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.580]   You offer Jesus to people.
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.020]   But if you don't offer,
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.940]   you're not extending what Jesus died to extend
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:55.780]   to that person.
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:59.680]   And it's normal, it is normal for us to have a sense
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.300]   of urgency in personal mission.
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.560]   In fact, this is what's fun.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.000]   Some of you are here tonight because of that.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.980]   Somebody took a risk, didn't they?
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.140]   Somebody said, somebody at work decided
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.860]   to have a non-work conversation with you
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.100]   and put themselves out there and say,
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.980]   hey, there's this thing I want you to come to.
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:14.820]   It's church.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:15.640]   I don't know how you deal where you're at with that,
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.480]   but please come.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.420]   And here you are.
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.740]   You didn't hit him in the face or anything.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.420]   You were like, all right, man, let's do this.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.040]   Somebody got you here with a risk.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.540]   Some family member, you know, sent you a little email
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.180]   or hit you up on, you know, gave you a text.
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.140]   And they said, hey, and with no doubt,
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.680]   hoping they don't push you away even further,
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.660]   decided to take one little risk,
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.000]   one further little step to say,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.180]   hey, you should try this place.
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.940]   And here you are.
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.100]   That's normal Christianity.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.360]   Then instead of just hoarding all our relational credibility
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.700]   that we would actually use it to connect people
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:48.980]   to the God who loves them.
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.380]   That's normal.
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:51.380]   That's how it works.
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.460]   Three things that we gotta keep
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:58.200]   if we're gonna be the church, really be the church.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.020]   Urgency in our personal mission,
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.180]   a willingness to be counter-cultural.
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.020]   And of course, my first point, which is so terrific,
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.300]   I'm having to scroll up to get it.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.580]   Authentic connection with other Christians.
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.320]   Let me finish here.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.060]   There's one more piece of the puzzle
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.340]   that I just think is so critical,
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.180]   that anywhere you find this,
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.780]   you have probably found a church,
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.140]   and anywhere you don't find this,
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.220]   you haven't found a church.
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.140]   And that's something that's called the gospel.
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.700]   The gospel is not just a type of music.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:24.540]   That's what I always thought it was.
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.380]   Like, what's gospel?
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.660]   Is that like a choir?
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.100]   The gospel is good news.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:29.940]   That's what it means.
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.180]   That's the word in Greek.
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.380]   It literally means good news.
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.220]   It's that simple.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.620]   So for the rest of your life, you know what gospel means.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:35.460]   It means good news.
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.320]   And you go, well, what's the good news?
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.360]   I could use good news.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.360]   Bad news everywhere.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.880]   It's the good news that even though you've sinned,
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.720]   you're loved.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.520]   It's that even though you've done wrong,
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.240]   God's good, and he's right.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.020]   It's that even though you've created shame for yourself
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.680]   through a series of choices you made,
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.000]   God made a series of choices to come and get you back.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.840]   The gospel means that even though we all were like sheep
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.560]   and went astray, that's what sheep do.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.640]   They kind of wander out of the way, okay?
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.840]   We are like that, the Bible says,
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:16.400]   but God, the good shepherd, comes to retrieve us.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.200]   That he would leave behind those who were already found
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.540]   and go to a great distance to come to get us.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.920]   And that he paid a great price
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:30.080]   so that we could know him and be forgiven
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.040]   and embrace real peace,
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:38.040]   peace that no amount of promotion or money or high
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.800]   or sexual fantasizing or conquering
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:45.060]   or whatever we put ourselves up to could ever offer.
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.280]   That Jesus actually climbed up on a cross,
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.360]   and when he was there,
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.160]   he wasn't just experiencing physical pain,
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.760]   he was experiencing the emotional and spiritual torment
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.320]   that we deserve as people who turned our back on God.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.800]   But God wouldn't turn his back on us.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:07.320]   He came to get us, and he paid for 100%.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.760]   Think about this, 100% of the debt.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.240]   I don't know if you've ever been in debt,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.700]   medical, student, credit card, automobile.
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.880]   I have no idea if you've ever been in debt
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.300]   and what that feels like, but oh, to be free.
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:25.320]   You may not have known that your sin in your life
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.680]   creates a debt that you could never pay to God
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.200]   because of his perfection and because of where you are,
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.000]   but he closed the gap.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.960]   He came all the way here.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.920]   He lived a perfect life.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.320]   He never messed up.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.140]   I don't know if you knew that.
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.160]   You'll never get to the page of the Bible,
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.540]   like where's the one where Jesus messed up?
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:42.380]   It's just not in there.
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.560]   He lived a perfect life.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.700]   And then he climbed on a cross,
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.520]   and he died a sufficient death,
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.880]   sufficient to bring us all to God.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.200]   Who could do that?
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.640]   Could take a room this size, rooms this size,
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.320]   a world this size of this much complexity
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.960]   and this much confusion and bring us all to God.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.880]   For what price?
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.880]   Free to us, expensive to him, but free to us by faith.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.240]   That's the core of the church.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:17.040]   It's how God built this for 2000 years,
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.840]   by telling people you're loved just as you are.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.120]   And all of the morality of the Christian faith
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.320]   and all of the behavior of the Christian faith
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:30.120]   is just a reaction to God's love who loved you first,
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.880]   who came 100% of the way to get you.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.760]   Not so that you could shape up,
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:40.560]   but so that you could know what love really is.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.720]   It find life in life indeed.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.080]   Let me pray for you.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.840]   Father, thank you for our evening tonight.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:49.080]   And God, I pray that if that sense of your love
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.480]   and your complete sufficient payment
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.520]   hasn't dawned on everyone who can hear my voice tonight,
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.480]   God, I pray that they would feel it, they would know.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.640]   Not just so they can feel a feeling,
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.000]   but they can know a savior.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.960]   They can know what love really is.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.080]   Not the conditional thing we thought it was,
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.880]   where if we do well, we're rewarded.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.840]   And if we don't do well, we're punished.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.280]   But just to know that we've all not done well,
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.480]   but you've withheld punishment.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.400]   Instead gave it to our substitute, Jesus.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:22.960]   And now the way is clear for us to get to you.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.680]   It might be counter-cultural.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.480]   It might be counter-intuitive.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.240]   It certainly is not anything we would have ever come up with
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.880]   but it's what you came up with.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.880]   And it's your way of getting to us
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.960]   when we never wanted to get to you.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.840]   Thank you, Jesus, that there is enough grace
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.840]   for everyone we know and even enough for us.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.080]   In Jesus' name.
