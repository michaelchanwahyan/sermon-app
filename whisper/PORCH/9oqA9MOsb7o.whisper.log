[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.300]   - Welcome to the porch, we're so excited.
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.300]   My name's David Marvin.
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.060]   I could not be more thrilled to introduce to you a panel
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.060]   unlike any panel we've ever had before.
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.620]   And so some of these faces you'll probably recognize
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.100]   and some of them you may meet
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.580]   or will be meeting tonight for the first time.
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.080]   So I'm gonna let our panel introduce themselves.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.100]   You'll probably recognize Shane, Shane and JP,
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.580]   but Shane, why don't you start
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.580]   and you can introduce to us your better half,
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.140]   her lovely wife.
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.100]   - My name is Shane.
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.340]   And--
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.580]   - I think we got that.
[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.540]   - This is Beth, my wife.
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.260]   She is the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.380]   - I'm not sure you're following instructions here.
[00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.220]   - And.
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.420]   - Okay, perfect.
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.820]   (laughing)
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.140]   That was really touching.
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.740]   So good luck, Shane.
[00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.260]   - So my name is Shane.
[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.780]   This is my wife, Kelly.
[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.860]   She's married the most beautiful man in the whole world.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.100]   (laughing)
[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.100]   - Wow.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.660]   - I tell her you're welcome twice a day.
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.920]   (laughing)
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.340]   - All right, my name is Shane.
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.580]   (laughing)
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.380]   And it's just incredible just to be one of the greatest
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.140]   Christian vocalists in the world.
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.420]   And so I wrote you a song.
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.420]   ♪ The very first time ♪
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.980]   ♪ That I saw your green eyes ♪
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.100]   Kind of blue.
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.600]   ♪ Blue eyes ♪
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.020]   This is my wife, Monica,
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.660]   and it's fun to be here with you.
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.700]   Okay.
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.900]   - Powerful.
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.140]   So what I thought we'd do
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.340]   and what we're gonna have each couple do
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.820]   is kind of share briefly their story.
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.000]   And we even have some pictures of each couple
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.940]   from back in the day,
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.900]   which should be, if nothing else, entertaining.
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.940]   And so we're gonna look at those
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.240]   and why don't you guys start us out?
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.220]   How'd you meet?
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.500]   As we kind of explore for the last few weeks,
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.460]   if you haven't been with us,
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.380]   we're in this series called Battle of the Sexes,
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.980]   which is all about dating, marriage, sex, relationships,
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.100]   and really man and woman interacting.
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.060]   And so tonight, we're finishing,
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.820]   we're doing a panel to just address some of the questions
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.420]   that we did not cover,
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.100]   either because we didn't have the ability
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.820]   to take up an entire message for them
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.900]   or they just weren't on our radar,
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.540]   but thanks to you, they now are.
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.660]   So in order to get to know the couples,
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.700]   we just asked if they would prepare
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.520]   to be able to share briefly kind of their story,
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.140]   how they met and how long you've been married
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.540]   and where you are right now.
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.100]   - We, well, we've been married for six years,
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.980]   coming up in just a couple of weeks.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.960]   And we met out on the road on tour.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.220]   (laughing)
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.220]   - I'm not sure what to do with that.
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.060]   - I don't even know.
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.380]   - This is gonna be such a chain reaction.
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.900]   - This is what happened when you met?
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.940]   - No, that's the wrong picture.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.300]   Is there another one?
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.540]   No, that's the wrong one.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.500]   That's our family now.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.700]   - That's the day you met.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.180]   - She kissed me the first time we met.
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.220]   It was weird.
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.040]   No, you know, touring,
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.940]   Beth, her goad name is Bethany Dillon.
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.840]   - Because she's also a recording artist.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.440]   - She is a famous Christian singer.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.680]   (laughing)
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.160]   And no, she came on tour with us
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.800]   and going out on tour on a tour bus
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.280]   is a super unique situation
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.920]   because there's 12 bunks, there's 14 people,
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.600]   and you're out on the road for two months.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.120]   And so we didn't share about that.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.360]   I don't know why you said that.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.360]   But no, it's just such an interesting--
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.300]   - The math is breaking down a little bit.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.140]   - Yeah, well, you know--
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.960]   - 14 people.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.700]   - I wanted to clarify.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.540]   - We're all a little confused.
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.360]   - Yeah.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.040]   - We're just going right past it.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.460]   - We're just going right on past it.
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.260]   - So you met, you dated on a tour bus.
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.100]   - We didn't date.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.380]   We didn't date, which that was lesson number two.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.820]   Don't date on a tour bus.
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.820]   - We're all confused.
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.500]   - I know, we should have gone first.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.340]   - You're married, though.
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.380]   That's where we met.
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.220]   - All right, I'll tell our story.
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.460]   So we met on the road.
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.460]   (audience cheering)
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.660]   And we're friends, and then liked each other,
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.160]   and then dated each other.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.940]   And I lived in Ohio.
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.500]   I'm from Ohio, and he was here in Dallas.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.300]   And it was kind of a long process
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.920]   from being friends to dating
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.600]   because there's an age difference between us
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.400]   of about 20 years, not really.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.860]   But I'm just kidding.
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.040]   Not that much.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.880]   - But close.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.400]   - But close, no, not, no, anyway.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.280]   - It's a decade.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.280]   - So it took, I think it took a while
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.560]   for us to say that we liked each other
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.640]   and stop the texting and actually talk on the phone
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.960]   and make plans to see each other.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.520]   And so, yeah, and then we dated for, right?
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.360]   'Cause I need to tell that.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.880]   So we dated for almost a year,
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.060]   and then we were engaged for about 10 months.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.680]   And then, yeah, we've been married for six years.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.040]   We've got two kids, Lucy and Haven,
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.120]   who are awesome, and they're three and one.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.360]   - Who we saw a second ago.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.200]   - Yeah.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.040]   - So beautiful.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.280]   - I love it. - Not us, but yeah.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.520]   - Amazing, okay, so I'm sure we'll hear more
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.240]   kind of as a question that's about your story
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.080]   and how those intersect.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.960]   But what about you guys?
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.560]   So you guys met a long time ago in high school, right?
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.320]   - High school, yeah, we met in high school.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.160]   So picture this.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.440]   Chemistry class.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.440]   Test tubes and love.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.080]   We served up a beaker of love.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.200]   No, we didn't, we didn't date.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.920]   We didn't date then.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.920]   Kelly, we met in high school.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.000]   She dated a buddy of mine, and then we didn't talk.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.680]   No, seriously, I didn't know the Lord in high school.
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.480]   I got saved my senior year in college,
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.840]   and Kelly knew the Lord in high school,
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.520]   at least the part that I knew her.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.160]   She claims that we weren't friends,
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.080]   but in my mind, we were friends.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.520]   But I was at A&M, and she was at Baylor.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.120]   (audience cheering)
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.440]   Yes, so we were, so anyway,
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.360]   I ended up getting saved my senior year,
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.240]   and went to Baylor for this thing,
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.480]   and we just happened to run into each other,
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.800]   and I was like, man, I need to talk to you.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.080]   So she was the only, really the only Christian girl
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.920]   that I knew, and so I was like,
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.240]   man, my options are really small.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.400]   I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm so kidding.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.240]   That's stupid.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.120]   - This panel's going--
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.320]   - I'm available for marriage counseling.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.400]   - Better than we thought.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.800]   - Anyway, so no.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.840]   - It's turning out to be a bad idea.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.720]   - Seriously, check this out.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.600]   We were, I didn't really know any Christian girls,
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.200]   but I had this dance coming up called Ring Dance at A&M.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.160]   And you got that picture?
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.080]   Throw that one up.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.600]   Come on, guys.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.480]   You knew it was coming.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.600]   Anyway, so we went on, our first date
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.880]   was this thing called Ring Dance.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.720]   - There it is.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.200]   Are you sure that wasn't high school?
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.160]   - That was our first date, right there.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.360]   April 26, 1997, is that right?
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.400]   I think it's right.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.240]   Is that right?
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.160]   So we went on a date, and I was in love,
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.000]   and we dated for about eight months or so.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.280]   Then she broke up with me, and here's a good dating tip.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.800]   When she was breaking up with me,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.440]   she lived in the, what were the apartments called?
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.280]   The Village at Baylor.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.320]   She was like, "We need to break up."
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.000]   I'm like, "Oh, man, I'm not hearing that from the Lord."
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.600]   But anyway, she broke up with me.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.960]   As I'm saying goodbye, like this is the final goodbye,
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.080]   she sticks her head out the door, and she goes,
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.960]   "I love you," shuts the door.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.120]   Did you know that?
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.960]   You knew that, right?
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.040]   - I think that's gonna be a good thing to talk about
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.560]   when guarding the heart and all that.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.120]   - Yeah. - That was the first time.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.880]   - That was the first time she told me she loved me.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.720]   "I love you," shut the door.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.680]   - And locked it. - Locked it.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.680]   - See you later, forever. - I was like.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.800]   I'm calling the police.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.480]   - Ask, seek, knock.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.080]   - Yeah, so anyway, all that to say,
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.840]   after a few years, we ended up reconnecting.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.400]   She went abroad for a few years, came back,
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.240]   and now we ended up reconnecting,
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.720]   getting engaged after about four months.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.320]   We're married, now we're married almost 12 years,
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.880]   this coming up, in May.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.520]   12 years, we have three girls,
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.200]   Olive, Lillian, and Emma, Rose.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:21.200]   And Olive is seven, Lily is three,
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.360]   and Emma's nine months.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.880]   So that's it, I'll shut up.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.320]   There they are. - There they are.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.880]   - I love it.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.440]   We've been married nine and a half years,
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.280]   and we met in college.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.120]   She was my best friend's sister,
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.360]   and so we were at a party, at an apartment,
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.200]   it wasn't really a party,
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.160]   we were hanging out at an apartment,
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.120]   and I told him, hey, his sister wanted to come over,
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.320]   and he was like, oh man, my sister wants to come over,
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.880]   and I was like, man, I'd like to meet your sister.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.800]   And I had no idea how badly I wanted to meet his sister.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.560]   And basically, we were not Christians,
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.880]   if you know my story, if you've been hanging out
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.080]   with us for a while, and so it was just kind of,
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.520]   it was everything not to do,
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.800]   that's pretty much Monica and I's story.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.600]   I moved to Dallas, she stayed in Waco,
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.040]   we started dating in a committed relationship,
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.000]   it was manic highs and lows, I love you, I hate you.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.320]   I probably went through depression in that time,
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.800]   just from being here and not really knowing anyone,
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.840]   and just kind of holding onto that Waco,
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.560]   that college lifestyle.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.160]   And then I was at a bar, hungover,
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.320]   I was at a bar, invited to church, came, hungover,
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.840]   trusted Christ, radical life change, talked to her,
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.480]   I said, you know, who do you believe,
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.520]   what do you believe about God,
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.080]   and we had talked about God before,
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.440]   and she had straightened out morally before I did,
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.120]   and so she kind of got on the straight and narrow,
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.240]   and didn't think partying was still fun like I did,
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.480]   and she just matured, you know,
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.640]   and so she articulated the gospel,
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.600]   we both kind of knew the gospel,
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.960]   and she articulated the gospel,
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.280]   and I said, okay, I believe that too,
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.440]   we need to figure this deal out,
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.000]   and God just kind of came in our lives,
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.600]   and we were not pure by any stretch of the imagination,
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.160]   and then we stepped into that world,
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.120]   and said, okay, now we need to stop all things sexual here,
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.960]   which was incredibly difficult, as you can imagine,
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.120]   and so then shortly thereafter,
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.360]   you know, the way that that works out,
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.840]   once you cut off the physical,
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.640]   I mean, we were engaged very shortly thereafter,
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.760]   'cause my friend Paul says,
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.040]   it's better to marry than to burn,
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.040]   and so we did, we were engaged for four months.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:40.400]   - Is she having more? - She's counting, she said.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.040]   Yeah, four, five months, so we were engaged five months,
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.120]   and then married, and I'll tell you more about this later,
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.200]   but essentially, Christ was at the center of our lives
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.480]   at that time, but there was just a lot of baggage,
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.600]   and so we spent about three years in our marriage
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.280]   really healing from all of the baggage
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.520]   that we brought into it,
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.240]   which was pretty difficult times, frankly,
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.440]   and so today, we have two little girls,
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.800]   Presley and Finley, and then a 17-month-old in Weston.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.400]   I don't know if we have those, do we show any pictures?
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.480]   So there's the family.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.400]   That's good.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.720]   - Well, that really transitions,
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.200]   or your story's a perfect transition
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.600]   to one of the first questions that's come in,
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.000]   which is about if two believers are dating,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.240]   and they're not initially sexually pure,
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.120]   but are now wanting to pursue purity,
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.800]   what are some practical steps to help with this?
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.920]   And really, your story answers the second question,
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.340]   and is it even possible to have a healthy relationship
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.240]   after sexual impurity, which could still lead to marriage?
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.320]   So practical steps on a couple
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.880]   that's had sexual past together,
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.480]   like they've made a mistake, but they're saying,
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.240]   hey, we wanna fight, and we wanna pursue purity,
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.320]   what would you say are some steps that helped?
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.080]   - Yeah, I just think once you start pursuing Christ,
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.200]   you become a new creation, right?
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.580]   And so God's bigger than that,
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.320]   but you have to pursue him, ultimate in your life.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.560]   In 1 Corinthians 6, it just says,
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.080]   flee sexual immorality.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.760]   And so the easiest way to flee sexual immorality
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.880]   is to Matthew 6, 33,
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.160]   seek first his kingdom and his righteousness.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.000]   And all that other stuff, he's gonna add to it,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.960]   he tells you, but if you seek him first,
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.000]   and so I'm not talking about
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.400]   check the box Dallas Christian,
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.760]   like I'm going to church and the porch on Tuesday,
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.440]   I'm talking about the trajectory of your life
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.460]   is pursuing the creator of the heavens and the earth,
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.600]   that's why you were created.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.960]   Once you begin doing that,
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.200]   we had a guy tell us this in premarital counseling,
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.680]   he just says, hey, stop pursuing each other,
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.800]   'cause we were, you know,
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.080]   just pursuing each other with everything.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.160]   He says, stop pursuing each other
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.360]   and start pursuing the Lord together.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.440]   And I thought that was such stupid advice
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.880]   until it was really what saved us.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.280]   I mean, it was what gave us marriage
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.460]   and preserved our marriage,
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.360]   is when we started pursuing God ultimately,
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.740]   see, when you pursue each other, it's hit or miss,
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.120]   but when you pursue God ultimately,
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.240]   you're constantly growing closer and closer together,
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.200]   and you're trusting the spirit to make you
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.280]   and conform you to the image and the character of Jesus.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.240]   And so two human beings cannot get along.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.000]   I mean, we don't do that well,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.680]   particularly when you're male and female,
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.640]   you're so different,
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.040]   but when you're pursuing the Lord
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.440]   and he's making you both like Christ,
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.120]   all of the sudden there is a spirit of oneness that happens.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.120]   What would you add?
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.340]   - Yeah, I think just, and even in hearing that question,
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:19.080]   and when Jonathan, or sorry, I call him Jonathan, not JP.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.800]   And so when he came to me last week
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.040]   and just said, "Hey, we're gonna do this panel,
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.040]   "here's what we're thinking."
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.040]   And I just immediately was like, "Oh no, that's not me."
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.560]   And just really feeling inadequate to get up here
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.440]   and talk on just dating and what that looks like,
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.020]   because we just did everything wrong.
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:45.580]   I mean, the Lord did grab hold of our hearts,
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.760]   and so thankful for that.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.240]   And so the one thing that we didn't even do,
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.920]   he did, is just redeem us.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.280]   And so no matter where you are, or where you've been,
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.720]   or what you've done, I mean,
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.800]   he is more powerful than any of it.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.920]   And he redeems and he saves.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.680]   And the verse that I think of is,
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.020]   "While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.760]   And so it is not what you're gonna be,
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.920]   or what you were, but where you are right now.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.440]   I mean, he just comes in and redeems and makes new.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.920]   - Yeah, and I just pursue him ultimately,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.600]   would be what I say, and he can.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.880]   If you're not gonna pursue him ultimately,
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.080]   break up right now.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.480]   Like, don't waste any more time.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.880]   - Excellent.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.920]   Okay, so this question would probably be good for you guys,
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.160]   'cause I'm sure you had to do this.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.080]   But we talk about guarding against sexual impurity.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.600]   How do you guard your heart emotionally?
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.800]   And being in a bus, I'm sure you either
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.840]   did this well or didn't.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.320]   And so maybe you can speak to how
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.080]   you would answer that question.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:16:00.760]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:05.760]   - There's actually one night that was really weird, 'cause--
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:10.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.520]   Shane and I, we were bus drivers.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.680]   So most of the time, most of our lives,
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.760]   we've been driving a bus.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.000]   So he would drive at night, till like a tour,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.960]   yeah, the tour bus, till like 3 a.m. or 4 a.m.,
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.600]   and then I would get up in the morning,
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.680]   and I would finish the drive at like 6 o'clock.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.140]   Well, I'm a really light sleeper,
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.020]   and so I just, we would go all day.
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.400]   We would play every single day, or six out of seven days.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.960]   And so we would just be traveling across the country,
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.320]   and I would go to bed at one or two in the morning,
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.680]   and then Shane would be driving, so that's terrifying.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.520]   Because he would be watching a DVD,
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.560]   the computer screen would be up,
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.640]   he'd be on the phone, be playing a video game,
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.480]   and driving a bus full of people.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.920]   And so I would just be terrified.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.800]   And so I started to take Ambien to help me sleep,
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.440]   which totally worked.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.160]   But so I took Ambien one night,
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.920]   and then I tried to go to bed, and--
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.960]   - Do we need to preface anything here?
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.120]   - Like something would happen,
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.560]   and I would turn into like Shane-bian.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.480]   And I don't even remember this,
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.840]   but there was one night where I started
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.160]   messing with, playing with Beth's toes.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.320]   - What?
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.160]   - Someone else was there.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.200]   This is so weird.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.000]   I feel like I'm just getting more and more scared
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.440]   of your answers, the longer we're on this.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.200]   - No, I would just say, I would say,
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.680]   I would say, you know, self-control.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.760]   No, seriously, seriously.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.840]   Like, man, you wanna guard, you wanna guard--
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.920]   - It sounds like, you have self-control.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:49.080]   - Well, the toe incident was, yeah, it was wrong.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.400]   I repented.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.440]   - Shane, I got self-control out of that.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.200]   That's what I heard, self-control.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.760]   - No, I would just say--
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.280]   - He was there too, so that was a camera.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.120]   - Yeah, self-control.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.360]   I mean, you know, our version of dating,
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.320]   you guys have done such a great job of teaching on dating.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:13.320]   And we have a tendency to adopt
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.520]   all of our culture's ideas of dating.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.880]   And so it's like, you know, hang out with a girl,
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.880]   hold hands, kiss, connect the dots, you know,
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.960]   touch the toes, you know.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.320]   It just, it goes there.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.440]   Just don't do that.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.320]   I mean, just don't do that.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.600]   Why would you, I mean, like, yeah,
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.280]   I would just say, if you treat,
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.680]   like do some of the things that we've heard
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.280]   the last few weeks, like if you haven't heard it,
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.200]   just go back and podcast it.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.160]   If you treat a woman like your sister,
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.520]   it helps with the guarding of the heart thing, you know.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.560]   Because you don't have to, you haven't crossed
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.480]   all these sexual boundaries that you have to,
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.440]   that you have to all of a sudden go, oh, you know,
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.920]   I did that, and see you later.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.320]   And, you know, on top of a whole--
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.360]   - But what about emotional guarding?
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.080]   - And it sounds like you guys communicated,
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.000]   you reached a point where you said,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.200]   hey, we can't just text any longer.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.920]   We're gonna communicate really well
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.240]   on where we're going and what's going on,
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.760]   which probably helped at some level guarding the heart.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.760]   - I would say he's hilarious and so, you know,
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:33.080]   so wise, like the Lord really, for all of his funniness
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.360]   and quirkiness, when I think about our story,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.960]   like, and before that even, he was on the road a lot
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.560]   as a single man, and there are a lot of stories
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.000]   of girls who had crushes on him or would talk to him,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.600]   and he really had to, like, be disciplined
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.760]   in guarding people's hearts as far as, like,
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.440]   length of conversation or being in the same room
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.320]   with someone or being in the same car on a road trip
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.600]   or I've heard as his wife multiple stories.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.760]   So I know that the Lord really gave him
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.040]   a lot of grace in that and so then when we started
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.480]   liking each other and then dating long distance
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.560]   and there was almost an impatience in me
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.840]   of wanting him to just, like, cut to the chase
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.960]   and say, I love you, I wanna get married
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.280]   because I felt that in my heart,
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.400]   but then, like, later on in our,
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.720]   in, like, further down the road and we are engaged,
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.320]   like, it took him a long time even to just talk
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.880]   about marriage, like, he didn't, which this isn't a rule,
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.680]   but he didn't wanna talk about marriage
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.680]   until it was like, I've got a ring for him
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.680]   because it was like, I wanna guard your heart.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.600]   Like, I don't want, I don't wanna, like,
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.520]   string this out and play this out in your mind
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.000]   and in your heart and we're far apart
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.640]   and, you know, not guard my heart.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.640]   And so I would say that he did it really well
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.760]   as far as just being thoughtful
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.600]   about what we even talked about
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.360]   and the way that our time together looked and, you know.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.320]   - Yeah, that's excellent, love it.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.320]   Well, this next question says, and so E,
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.320]   maybe you and Kelly can speak to this one.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.760]   Is it ever okay for a girl to nudge
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.420]   or slash pursue a boy she's interested in?
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:27.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:27.960]   - Uh.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:39.200]   Well, you know, I mean, I think it's weird.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.560]   - Can I say something? - Yeah.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:50.640]   - Okay, I like this question because Shane would be
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.640]   like the poster boy for what it looks like to pursue a girl.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.320]   And I'm gonna get teary a little bit.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:03.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.800]   He is a beautiful man.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.800]   - The book's coming, the book's coming.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.640]   - Oh, hi.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.000]   - I'm just kidding. - You're welcome.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.840]   - Yeah.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.360]   Anyway, I just wanna start too
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.480]   with just a verse that's coming to mind.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.400]   And in looking back, I just see that this,
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.080]   that God's word proves itself true.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.640]   And it usually happens in our humanity to look back
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.980]   and go, oh yeah, you were right, Lord.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:34.760]   But in Ephesians 5:33, I think it says,
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:39.000]   wives or husbands love your wives,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.380]   wives respect your husbands.
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:46.380]   And I can see how in the way that you pursued me,
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.880]   in the way that we're created,
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.200]   or a woman's heart wants to be pursued.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.280]   We wanna be loved and men wanna be respected.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.760]   And so backing up, so I was at Baylor
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.720]   and Shane was at A&M and I worked at a coffee shop
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.680]   at Common Grounds and it's still cool.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:15.520]   And I am a morning person, so I took the morning shift
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.480]   at 6 a.m., opened the coffee shop.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:23.480]   And Shane would leave A&M, I guess you had to leave
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:28.120]   at like 4.30 in the morning to get to Common Grounds
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.500]   an hour and a half later by six to meet me there
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.480]   to help me open the coffee shop.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.000]   And he would help me sweep and mop up
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.320]   and get ready for the day.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.200]   And then I had an eight o'clock class
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.260]   so then he would leave.
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.320]   And then another time we were,
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:50.320]   or I was pulling an all-nighter in Baylor's library
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.040]   and just up typing a paper down in the basement
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.520]   where all the computers were back then.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:01.360]   And I'm sitting there typing and I look over
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.400]   and there's Shane and he goes to A&M
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.480]   but he's at Baylor's library.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.520]   And I look over and I'm like, Shane, Shane,
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.440]   what are you doing?
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.000]   He's like, oh hey, what's up?
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.440]   [audience laughing]
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.320]   And you're not even supposed to be able to get
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.920]   in the library unless you're a Baylor student.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.400]   So he would just maneuver, he would place himself
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.440]   at different places around campus.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.800]   I'd be running the bear trail.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.920]   And he drove this big red truck
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.700]   and my accountability partner's like, isn't that Shane?
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.540]   [audience laughing]
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.040]   And I'd be like, yeah, it is, what are you doing here?
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.120]   >> It's kind of psychotic, it's kind of stalkerish.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.200]   [audience laughing]
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.440]   But she was into me, you know?
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.000]   So it made a difference.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.360]   >> But anyway, all that to say is that
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.120]   he really pursued me.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:55.120]   There were just endless stories that I could tell
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.520]   to people about and they could see
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.240]   that this person is pursuing you.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.480]   This person loves you, he likes being around you,
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.520]   he respects you, all of this.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.800]   And even if I wasn't that into him,
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.280]   I mean, it really made me go, wow,
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.120]   this person really likes me, this person really loves me.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.840]   There was no doubt about it in my mind
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.280]   that I was being pursued.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:27.080]   And then the very natural response to that is,
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.960]   do I want to be pursued?
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.180]   Do I like this?
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:36.180]   And so, you know, then I could say no or yes.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.560]   And I did like it and I did like him,
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.000]   and so I allowed that.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.280]   And now that we've been married for 11 years
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.900]   and we have three children and life is messy
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.240]   and I'm changing diapers and the girls are sick,
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.400]   or you know, it just, you have layers and layers
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.720]   of these roles now as a wife and a mother
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.320]   and all of these things and life gets hard.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:05.280]   And even when we conflict, I can think back
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.160]   to where we started and there's a confidence
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:12.440]   in knowing this man pursued me, he loved me,
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.040]   and he loves me, and that's where we started.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:21.040]   So, I just think back to being single
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.640]   and wondering who my husband would be one day
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.480]   and for all you girls out there that, you know,
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:33.480]   are single and I just know it's in every girl's heart
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.640]   to be pursued and you wanna be sure.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.800]   You don't wanna be married five years in
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.760]   and have a conflict and go, you know what?
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.880]   You never loved me anyway.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.340]   You didn't pursue me, you know?
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.420]   And 'cause that's where you go, you go back.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.000]   When you're having a hard time, you go, okay,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.760]   why am I married?
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.600]   Oh yeah.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.880]   Anyway, there you go.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.360]   I love you.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.200]   - Okay.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.760]   So, no, but tons of good stuff.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.980]   Like, you responded and you communicated,
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:08.240]   hey, keep pursuing me, which is big 'cause when guys pursue,
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.400]   girls need to say either stop or yes.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.640]   - Yeah, I think there's just a level of,
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:18.340]   I think just in general, I think our culture is,
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.240]   they're big feelers.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.660]   I mean, I think we're all kind of feelers
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.560]   and we wanna feel it out.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.660]   We don't wanna put ourself out there
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.240]   because we're scared of the rejection
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.480]   or we're scared of hurting someone's feeling.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.220]   Girls, hurt their feelings, they'll be fine.
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.480]   You know, hurt their feelings.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.560]   It's not worth it.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.600]   It's not worth dragging some poor dude along
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.560]   that you're like, ah, you know, I guess he's,
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.920]   you know, he's somebody.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:41.760]   That's ridiculous.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.600]   Don't do that.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.340]   And guys, vice versa.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.860]   It's just like, man, don't hang out with her
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:46.840]   'cause she's fine.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.800]   If you're not pursuing her, you know she likes you
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.560]   and you know if he likes you.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.320]   To think that you don't is great.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.680]   You know, you always hear people talking like,
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.040]   ah, we're just hanging out.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.280]   I don't like him, but he's fun.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.960]   Pays for dinner, come on.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.720]   You know, like, I think the reality is
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.640]   it's just like usually somebody's liking somebody, you know?
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.700]   And I think we all kind of glaze over that,
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:20.700]   but I think you guys know what the other's intent is
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:26.000]   and I think as long as you are clear,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.520]   I think you can save friendships
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.360]   and you can save a lot of heartache
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.740]   if you just, you are clear.
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.240]   You can't be responsible for if somebody else is clear.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.440]   You know, it's just like if you're a girl
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.400]   and you got the dude that's taking you out
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.960]   for 16 Dutch dates, you know,
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.560]   and you're like, are we doing this?
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.440]   And if he's like, you know, hey man,
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.720]   you know, we're just having a good time.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.440]   Get rid of that jerk, you know?
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.440]   It's just like, come on.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.840]   And guys, vice versa.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.480]   You know, I mean, I just think,
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.880]   just be honest with each other about where you are,
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.320]   you know, emotionally and like, man, I'm in this thing.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.120]   I'm pursuing you, you know?
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:03.120]   And if not, you know, go see a movie by yourself.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.420]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.180]   - Really good, anything you'd add?
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:13.940]   I know you've said before, maybe not ask out,
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.640]   but put yourself in front of them
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.140]   or you wouldn't say that's what it is.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.620]   - Yeah, I just think, I think, man,
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.580]   a good play is the serving, you know,
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.340]   serve somewhere, serve together.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.300]   You don't have to, okay?
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.660]   Like, trust God, God's big.
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.860]   He controls everything.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.980]   Like, don't lose sight of that.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.900]   Like, God really does control everything.
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.980]   He's sovereign and he loves you.
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.900]   He loves you more than you'll ever get your mind around,
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.420]   that he loves you, he has a plan for you.
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.660]   Don't give up on him, okay?
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.420]   And so, serve somewhere.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.100]   I mean, continue to be faithful, continue to pursue him.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.820]   And you know, he does have a plan for your life.
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.660]   And you don't have to be bold and,
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:49.940]   I mean, if you ask a dude out,
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.180]   you're probably gonna end up with a passive guy.
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.780]   And I see that all the time and it's just a train wreck, so.
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.060]   - Yes, and I think, too,
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.780]   I would just add to that,
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.220]   that I was talking with a friend
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.740]   just the other night about this,
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:08.420]   just in that, you know, if you see a guy,
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.260]   if you're a girl and you see a guy and you're like,
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.580]   oh, I really like him, you know,
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.020]   I would love for him to ask me out.
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.300]   And I feel like you start going down a path
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.740]   of almost fantasizing, oh, well,
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.020]   I wonder what it'd be like to date him.
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.100]   And I wonder, you know, what this is like
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.140]   and I wonder what that is like.
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.940]   And instead of doing that, like, absolutely,
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.780]   you can pull out qualities of godliness
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:30.220]   that you see in, you know, whoever it is,
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:35.020]   but don't make it a personal thing where it's,
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.020]   oh, I've gotta have that guy.
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.260]   And so there might be qualities in that guy
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.140]   that you're like, you know what,
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.580]   I would love to marry a man that has that quality,
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.020]   but just not making it personal.
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.980]   And that helps to guard, I think,
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.060]   a woman's heart, just in that.
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:52.780]   - That's great, excellent.
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.900]   So next one is for you guys.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.740]   Can you go on a date with several people
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.740]   or can you date at the same time several different people?
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:06.260]   - Well, I would say it depends on how you define date.
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.900]   I think that if you're, you know,
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.540]   seeking a relationship, then no.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:17.140]   You know, the Bible tells us to, you know,
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.740]   even just the golden rule of loving others
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.500]   as you would love your, or love others
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.060]   as you would be loved, as you would wanna be loved.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.220]   And it's just not loving to anyone,
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.500]   to yourself or to other people.
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:34.500]   If you're in a relationship with more than one person,
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:39.020]   I would say, you know, just a casual date
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.060]   that is nothing, you know, it's just,
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.260]   hey, do you wanna hang out or do you wanna grab coffee?
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:46.780]   Or I think it depends on how you're defining date
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:47.620]   that I would say.
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.900]   - Yeah, can you go on a date, you know,
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.540]   can you go on a date this week with a date,
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.900]   hey, sorry, not interested, next week,
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.140]   can you go on a date, hey, sorry, not interested?
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.500]   Here's what I'd say, everything you're doing,
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.100]   you're earning reputation, you need to know that.
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.860]   And so, man, the circles of which
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.180]   you can actually marry someone,
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.300]   they're really small circles.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.820]   I mean, the whole world, and then like the ones
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.380]   who really follow Jesus, that's a really small circle.
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.100]   And so all of a sudden, you're the guy that's like,
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.740]   yeah, man, you know, girls are like,
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.260]   oh, you know, he asked out my best friend last week
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.060]   and my other best friend this week and me, you know,
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:19.700]   and so then you're that guy.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.260]   So be careful, 'cause you're earning reputation.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.500]   It depends on how you date.
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.380]   And so if you're there and you're leaving them
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.980]   better than you found them, then she would just say,
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.820]   hey, you know what, I'm bummed that there's not
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:32.700]   a second date, but I can't hold anything against you
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:33.900]   based on the way you talked to me,
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:34.980]   the way you were honest with me,
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.940]   you looked me in the eyes, and you told me,
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.780]   you kind of, you didn't leave me to wonder.
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.300]   But can you date multiple people at one time?
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.660]   I would say that doesn't honor God.
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.700]   Romans 12, nine says that love must be sincere.
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:47.740]   Paul says to the Philippians,
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.100]   do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit.
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.340]   We see throughout the scriptures,
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.220]   consider others more important than yourselves,
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.300]   or as Monica said, love others how you wanna be loved,
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.140]   give to other people.
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.180]   And so nobody wants to be the person
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.220]   that's kind of dating, so I mean, you know what I mean?
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.620]   Like we see, I know we see that on TV,
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.180]   where one person's dating a bunch of people at one time,
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.060]   and it looks ideal and it looks okay.
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.700]   It's not okay, it was never God's ideal.
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.600]   It was never, ever, ever God's ideal.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.020]   - Amazing.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.860]   So this one's come up a few times,
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.020]   just been texted in, thoughts,
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.260]   and we've touched on this a little bit at the porch,
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.520]   but online dating.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:28.060]   So do you guys have thoughts on what is appropriate
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.820]   and not appropriate, and how would you handle,
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.140]   specifically it's come in, hey,
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.520]   what are your thoughts on online dating?
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.660]   Any advice on how to handle online dating?
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.700]   What, is online dating okay?
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:42.220]   - I have no idea.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.260]   I have a good friend, I have a good friend who
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:52.740]   doesn't have, or doesn't even put himself in a position
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.220]   to have a lot of avenues to meet people.
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:59.220]   And so online dating is a commonplace for him,
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.460]   but it doesn't usually end up very good.
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:06.500]   And so I'm a bad person to ask, I really don't know.
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:10.860]   I would assume that there is a whole bunch of stories
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.700]   that have made it and have been God-honoring.
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.620]   I just don't know one, so.
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:19.580]   - Two things I'd say, here's what I'd tell you.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.620]   So there's just two things you can live by, okay?
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.660]   Don't date a stranger, okay?
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.700]   And so what I mean by that is,
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.060]   you should have some level of information about someone
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.300]   before you engage with them,
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:34.860]   and before you're alone with them at Starbucks or wherever,
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:38.640]   you should know, hey, this person's sold out for Christ.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.500]   They have an honorable reputation.
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.620]   And then I would say, so one, don't date a stranger.
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.860]   Two, profiles lie, okay?
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.500]   And so I can be whoever I wanna be online.
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.740]   Don't get catfished, right?
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.220]   I mean, that's happening.
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:55.060]   And so I can be online and be like,
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:58.380]   oh man, I just got back from starting an orphanage in Haiti
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.940]   and I saved kittens from burning buildings
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.740]   and I love Jesus with all my heart,
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:05.220]   and I could be a serial killer.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:09.220]   And so just be wise in the way that you go about that.
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.980]   Here's the biblical perspective on online dating,
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:12.980]   there's not one.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.220]   And so God doesn't say, hey, thou shalt not.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:18.100]   I'm not gonna tell you thou shalt not, but be wise.
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.980]   Don't date a stranger, profiles lie.
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.140]   - Amazing.
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:22.980]   Well, how about this?
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.300]   We've talked about this a little bit earlier
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.500]   about how specifically the question is,
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.540]   Psalm 37 promises the desires of my heart.
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.940]   Does this include desires for a husband and for children?
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.700]   How do I know if marriage is a part of God's plan for me?
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:46.060]   - I would say that I think that desires to be married
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:50.460]   and be a parent are godly desires,
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.860]   especially as a believer.
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:57.260]   One of my dearest friends is, I grew up with her,
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:01.380]   and she's single and actually lived with us.
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.940]   She was living overseas and came back and lived with us
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.100]   for a year at our house,
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.660]   which was a wonderful year to get to hang with her.
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:15.020]   And she has a huge desire to be married.
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:18.660]   And then even more so when she lived with us,
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.940]   I was pregnant for our second while she was living with us
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.500]   and had our second within that span of a year.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.140]   And so she was involved in the nitty gritty of,
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.900]   you know, just like everyday married life, being a mom.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.860]   She got really connected with the girls
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.820]   and was really honest with me.
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.820]   You know, she had some hard days of like,
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.580]   I really desire this.
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.860]   And I would say that she, for me,
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.300]   because I got married young,
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.260]   and so it's just been good for me
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:52.260]   and such a learning experience of trusting the Lord.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.760]   And she's just set a really good example, I feel like,
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:00.300]   as far as desiring those things,
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.860]   but those things not being ultimate things.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.980]   Mark Driscoll, the pastor of a church called Mars Hill
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:09.940]   in Seattle, has said a few times
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.220]   that good things can quickly become bad things
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.980]   when they become ultimate things.
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:18.400]   And so I just see her, I mean, it's a process.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.300]   She's not everyday like, I wanna be married and a mom,
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.260]   but whatever, I just love the Lord.
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.180]   I mean, it's a wrestling in her heart
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.580]   because it hasn't happened
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.300]   and there's nothing on the horizon.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:33.100]   And she's awesome, you know, and she's pursuing the Lord
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:36.300]   and she's being, you know, faithful.
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.140]   I mean, messy faithful, like I'm messy faithful,
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.100]   but she's being faithful and loves Him
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.460]   and is in community and serving and in the Word
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.180]   and praying and doing all the right things,
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.260]   all the checks, you know, and it's not happening,
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.760]   and that's a desire of hers.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.820]   But I feel like the Lord is just teaching her a lot
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.660]   about contentment in Him and also being honest
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.340]   because those aren't bad things to desire.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.020]   I think it's just a hard place to be in.
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.740]   And so even though I'm not single,
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:05.620]   I feel like she's living that out in a good way
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.900]   because He's what satisfies our hearts
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.980]   'cause she saw firsthand in our house, like,
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.980]   oh, being a wife, even to Shane Bernard,
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:19.020]   even though he's awesome, being a wife and being a mom
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.740]   doesn't make you happy perfectly all the time, you know?
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.860]   Like, Beth doesn't have an awesome day every day
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.940]   because she's married and she's a mom.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:31.060]   Like, she knows that, but she saw that.
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.460]   And still she desires that.
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.700]   And so I think it's that cyclical, like,
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.340]   yeah, He satisfies her heart
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.420]   and He's also put the wiring in her of like,
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.900]   I wanna be a mom.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:43.620]   I wanna walk alongside someone.
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:47.340]   And so anyway, I just think she's faithfully walking
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.340]   that out and I'm really encouraged by it.
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.660]   - Yeah, that's great, Beth.
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:53.820]   I would say, truly, Psalm 37 says,
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:54.820]   "Delight yourself in the Lord
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.460]   "and He will give the desires of your heart."
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:57.980]   And we love that second part
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.580]   and we forsake that first part.
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.620]   And so Psalm 37 is not a promise
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:05.780]   that if you want a husband and children,
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:06.860]   that you will have that.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.820]   There are a lot of things that I want that I don't have
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.340]   and there are a lot of things that I want that are unhealthy.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.620]   And so specifically, that first part
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.420]   is delight yourself in the Lord.
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.260]   And as we see in Luke 11, Jesus says,
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.740]   "Hey, this is how you pray."
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:19.820]   And at the end of it, it says,
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.460]   "Your father desires to give you good things.
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.380]   "He's a perfect, loving Father in heaven
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.660]   "whose all power is His."
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:25.720]   And at the end of it, it says,
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.900]   "This is how He answers your prayers.
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.140]   "He gives you more of His Spirit."
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.180]   And so as you bring your request to God,
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.940]   there isn't a lining of the heart that happens
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.540]   and He gives you more of Him.
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:36.780]   And I promise you, that's better than a husband.
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.260]   And so you live in a broken world.
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.520]   I mean, there are good things that you desire.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.900]   We see in the Proverbs that, you know,
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.900]   he who finds a wife finds a good thing,
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:46.500]   that marriage is a good thing.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.980]   But it's not promised to you and you're gonna be okay.
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.580]   And if you trust in Christ, you're gonna die
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:51.660]   and you're gonna go to heaven.
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.180]   And I'm still really confused
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.940]   when heaven stopped being good enough.
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.860]   Like we put so much stake on this life
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.260]   and the German shepherd, the picket fence,
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.460]   the house in Frisco, you know,
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:04.260]   the spouse, two kids, boy and girl.
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.120]   Listen, you get heaven at the end of this deal
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.060]   and you're not even married in heaven.
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:09.180]   Marriage is an ultimate.
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.980]   God tells us you're not married in heaven.
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.380]   And so, listen, here's what just happened.
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:14.940]   Yeah, right, Joker, you're married.
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.340]   You know, your wife's sitting right next to you.
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.460]   How can you tell us that?
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.900]   I get it, I spend a lot of my time with single people.
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.400]   Okay, a lot of my time.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.160]   You're not a lesser than.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.260]   You're not in a waiting room.
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:27.300]   You're not in a holding tank, okay?
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.940]   You will never in your entire life
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.660]   be able to be used more for the kingdom
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.100]   than you are right now.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.900]   Check out what Jesus says in Matthew 19, you know?
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.080]   He says, "It's good to be single
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.520]   "for the sake of my kingdom."
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.560]   And so, you've got resources that, frankly,
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.760]   I've got three kids and responsibilities
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.640]   that do weigh me down, not that they're bad things,
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.000]   but I have responsibilities that you don't have.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.320]   And I do, I think my greatest regret,
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.680]   our greatest regret as single folks
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.440]   is, man, we just wish we would've used that life
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:02.260]   for pursuing God rather than the bar or the next thrill.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.260]   - So, this is one that just came in for you guys.
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:09.380]   What do you do if you're dating someone
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.180]   who's not a Christian?
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:13.740]   Do you stay with them and try to bring them to God
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:14.940]   or do you break it off?
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:22.340]   - You just taught on this.
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:23.620]   I gotta be careful.
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:27.360]   I think you break it off, that's what I think.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:31.140]   I mean, we're not to be unequally yoked with somebody.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:34.140]   I mean, you can't, Kelly and I talked about this
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.640]   we have for years.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:39.220]   It's just like we have a standard that we hold to
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.320]   and that's the word of God.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:45.440]   We have a high priest, we have a mediator,
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.080]   we have Christ dwelling within us.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.120]   And to spend a life with somebody
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.560]   who doesn't operate on the same plumb line,
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.880]   who doesn't have the same standard,
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.880]   because when I'm not loving Kelly well,
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:04.740]   which is often, she can hold me up to the standard
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:08.160]   that I know and that's Christ.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:12.740]   And if you, I just don't, for me,
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:15.980]   if my wife didn't know the Lord,
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.100]   I just don't know what I would do.
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:22.600]   It would be because Christ teaches us how to forgive.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.860]   Christ teaches us how to love.
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.580]   Christ teaches us how to abstain.
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.880]   Christ teaches us how to speak.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:33.200]   I mean, the word of God in our hearts
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.280]   and the spirit within us is the only way
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:41.280]   that we have a chance to experience marriage
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.640]   in the way that it was meant to be experienced.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.760]   I mean, you can have a friend.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.080]   I mean, we all know our friends who are married
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.400]   and seem to have great relationships
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.360]   that don't know the Lord.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.760]   I mean, people make it.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.520]   I'm not saying that they don't.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.500]   But to experience marriage the way that it was meant
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:04.500]   to be created apart from the spirit of God is impossible.
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.300]   I believe it's impossible.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:11.220]   And I just, I thank the Lord that I have a wife
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.540]   who loves Jesus more than she loves me.
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:18.440]   It's the greatest gift that I've ever been given.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:22.140]   And I hope that for all of you
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.120]   because you've seen them go bad.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.520]   All of you have seen them go bad.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.160]   And without the standard of Christ in our life,
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:36.200]   the chances are great, you know?
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.880]   'Cause it's hard anyway.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.480]   That's the truth.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.560]   - That's really good.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.520]   Really, anything--
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.920]   - And I would say just to the ladies that,
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.260]   I mean, even in marriage, you know,
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:51.540]   there are disappointments and we all come into marriage
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:55.200]   thinking that it's one way and then the reality of marriage
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.740]   is something totally different.
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:02.740]   And it's better, but it's different than the expectations
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.720]   that you project on this relationship
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.320]   from the time that you're a little girl.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.360]   And the first year of our marriage,
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.240]   at the end of the first year,
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:18.240]   when we sat at Bob's Dickenshop house to celebrate,
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:22.120]   I just was bawling.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.720]   I mean, just reality check.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:26.880]   I was bawling not because he's a bad husband
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.520]   or wasn't what I thought he would be,
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.760]   but because I was disappointed in the reality
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.320]   of what marriage really looked like.
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:40.760]   It was real and he was still the same person
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.400]   and I was still the same person,
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.320]   but it wasn't like all of our problems went away
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.220]   and we just lived happily ever after.
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:51.640]   You know, it was more like a mirror held up
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.360]   to your selfishness.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.240]   And in dating and in engagement,
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:01.440]   I thought I was the nicest person on earth
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.860]   and I thought he was the sweetest,
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:07.360]   most romantic, pursuing man on earth.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.800]   And then after a year of marriage, I was like,
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.880]   oh, this is what it is.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:18.380]   Not in a bad way, but that's just the reality, you know,
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:21.920]   and tagged onto that, I just wanna say that
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:25.420]   because of the reality being better,
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:28.780]   believing God's word to be true in the midst of going,
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:30.060]   this doesn't feel better
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.020]   than what I thought marriage would be,
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:36.020]   that pressed me in to Jesus
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.940]   and that pressed me into God's word
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:40.260]   and I found some treasures there
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:43.460]   that if he didn't know the Lord in the first place,
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:46.300]   I couldn't cling to, which is where it says,
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.140]   wives, submit to your husbands,
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:53.140]   and it compares us to Christ submitting to the Lord
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.460]   and it says, submit to your husband
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:00.580]   so that if any of them, the husband,
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:02.980]   is not obedient to the word,
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.020]   which there'll be times when they're not,
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:08.020]   if any of them are disobedient to the word,
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:12.260]   you will win them over without a word
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:15.540]   by your chaste and respectful behavior
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.500]   and that was so powerful to me
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:21.700]   because I realized that in my disappointments
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.100]   or in the things that I saw in him,
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:25.620]   that I was like, I didn't know this,
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.060]   like, Lord, what am I supposed to do now?
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.660]   He wasn't everything that I thought,
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:31.740]   just like I'm not,
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:34.260]   I wasn't the nicest person he thought either.
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:39.380]   I realized I have an advocate in my marriage.
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:41.620]   Like, the Lord can speak to him.
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:44.420]   I don't have to be his boss.
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:46.740]   I don't have to be his Holy Spirit
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:52.620]   and I cannot tell you how many times at night
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:57.980]   we lay in bed after I talk to a friend
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.580]   that married an unbeliever
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.740]   or there's just distress in marriage,
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:05.980]   I say, Shane, I'm so thankful.
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:09.100]   I'm so thankful that you love Jesus
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:10.460]   and you're submitted to him
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:13.020]   because it takes all the pressure off.
[00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:16.180]   You don't have to marry the perfect person.
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:18.900]   You don't have to be the perfect person
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.740]   but if you're both, like JP said,
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:24.340]   you're both pursuing Jesus,
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:28.140]   then you have the same advocate who's for you
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.460]   and when the person next to you
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:34.140]   isn't doing what he's supposed to do,
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:36.580]   this is what the word says you're supposed to do
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:38.820]   and you're not doing it and that's not fair.
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:41.660]   That's how I felt, like, wait a minute.
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:43.860]   This wasn't what I signed up for.
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:49.620]   Then I can go, oh, Jesus says I can win him over
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:50.820]   without a word.
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:52.460]   I don't have to be a knack.
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.740]   I don't have to force him.
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.380]   I can go to my advocate
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:01.540]   and if you both don't know Jesus,
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:02.740]   if you're in a relationship
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:06.140]   or you're dating someone that doesn't know Jesus,
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:10.260]   then that person doesn't have the same resources
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:13.020]   that you do and you need to cut it off.
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.620]   That's the most loving thing you can do
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.140]   if you're in a relationship with an unbeliever.
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:18.980]   - That'll preach. - It's break up.
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.140]   - That'll preach, love it.
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:23.940]   - Because that brokenness will lead them.
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.740]   They'll see that they're broken
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.020]   and that brokenness will lead them to Jesus
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:30.860]   and if the Lord wants you to be married,
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:33.300]   he can bring it back around
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.940]   'cause we broke up and it was over
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.980]   and the Lord brought it back around.
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.820]   So that's all.
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.300]   - I'll just say too, I don't know if you can,
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:47.140]   it is like the greatest,
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:48.100]   you've heard Shane say it
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.660]   and I've heard JP say it personally to me several times,
[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:54.300]   but just to have someone who loves Jesus
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.820]   more than they love you.
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:58.340]   I mean, someone who loves Jesus
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.620]   and who surrendered to Jesus,
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:00.980]   there's just nothing greater
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:02.860]   and if you're in a relationship,
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.460]   we all know what it's like,
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:06.860]   oh man, they've won my heart.
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:09.620]   We all know that pull
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.180]   when there's an attraction with somebody
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:14.100]   and man, I can't do anything about it.
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.820]   We just say maybe just don't trust your heart.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.900]   Inform your heart with the word of God
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:23.580]   and with community, with a loving community
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:26.540]   'cause it is almost impossible
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.460]   to not follow your heart in those situations.
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:30.380]   This situation that came in,
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:32.700]   whoever you are, you're going,
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:33.540]   I hear what you're saying,
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:37.980]   but it's impossible for me to not want to love this person.
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:40.340]   And I would just say, just don't follow your heart.
[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:44.340]   Your heart is wicked above everything else,
[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:45.300]   it says in Proverbs.
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.420]   And so inform your heart with the word
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:51.020]   and sometimes it just means doing what you don't want to do
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:53.180]   and trusting that God is better.
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:55.780]   - Love it.
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:57.300]   Okay, so we'll do two more.
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:01.380]   This one, I think you guys could speak to well.
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.740]   It just talks about, there's been several that say,
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:08.020]   how do you date and deal with your baggage
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:10.060]   and when do you need to break up
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.900]   because of the other baggage that a person is bringing in
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:14.740]   or that you're bringing in as it kind of comes
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:15.820]   to the surface?
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:17.740]   And so what do you do with that?
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.620]   Does it mean that you have to break up?
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:22.580]   And how do you work through that?
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:25.180]   - There was a message we did,
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.660]   I think it's called Baggage Claim.
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.380]   It was in Boy Meets Girl series
[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:30.420]   and I just share some of Monica and I's story.
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:32.220]   But you have to deal with your baggage.
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:33.940]   I mean, whatever, I've never met,
[00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:36.580]   I mean, we meet with tons of single folks,
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.260]   we'd meet with people who are engaged,
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:39.740]   we'd meet with lots of married people.
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:41.420]   I've never met with, I've said this before,
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:44.100]   I've never met anyone with marriage problems.
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:46.660]   There are always single problems brought into marriage.
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.180]   And so you've got to, that baggage,
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:50.580]   that thing that you're holding onto
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:51.500]   that you're gonna try to hide,
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:55.340]   that abortion, that rape, that abuse,
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:51:00.980]   that pornography, that sexual promiscuity,
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:05.980]   that homosexual tendency, that whatever that is,
[00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.420]   that's gonna destroy your marriage
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:09.940]   before you even meet the person you're going to marry.
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:11.900]   So like in the future, like that's already done
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:15.580]   until you have sought healing in that
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:17.300]   and pursued Christ in that.
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:18.580]   And so we're not up here like trying
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:20.100]   to put a heavy yoke on you guys.
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.700]   There's about 3,000 folks here.
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:24.540]   Nothing would bring me more joy
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:27.780]   than 1,500 healthy marriages, like nothing.
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.660]   Like that would, like we talk about all the time
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:30.500]   changing the world.
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.900]   If there were 1,500 healthy marriages
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:34.500]   that came out of tonight, right,
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:36.540]   and I don't mean necessarily every boy and girl
[00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:38.620]   just hooking up, you guys know what I mean.
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:41.140]   But if there were 1,500 healthy marriages
[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.220]   that came out, I mean, we would change the world.
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.180]   You would make disciples, your kids would grow up,
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:47.420]   they'd have, I mean, you would change the legacy
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:49.060]   of the brokenness in your family.
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:52.380]   But you've got to start working on that now.
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:54.100]   And so I would just say if you're in a relationship
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:58.580]   and the path, the course you're on
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:51:59.860]   is not dealing with the baggage
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:02.060]   but continuing to fall into it, break up,
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.620]   hey, get well, and like, hey, I'm enabling you,
[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:06.020]   so you go get well.
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:09.580]   And then if the Lord brings us back together, great.
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:11.180]   But I'm not counting on that.
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:12.940]   I'm gonna go and I'm gonna pursue him
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:14.420]   and you need to go and pursue him.
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.180]   And I'm enabling you or causing you not to pursue him.
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:18.260]   So this is over.
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:21.460]   - And you're not gonna be the one
[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.820]   that's gonna change your boyfriend or girlfriend
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:27.220]   or spouse, like it is the Lord who's gonna do that work.
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:31.860]   And how great that if you realize that when you are single
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:35.100]   that you're not in that marriage, thinking,
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:36.420]   you know, or even praying.
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:39.260]   I feel like one of the questions maybe was about,
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:44.100]   just about praying for your spouse and what that looked like
[00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:48.140]   and it's great, like to pray for them
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:50.580]   to be who God wants them to be,
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:52.780]   but not who you want them to be.
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:55.540]   And you're just not the one that's gonna change them.
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.900]   It's gonna be the Lord.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.060]   - That's excellent, excellent.
[00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:01.260]   So there may be a scenario where they are in community
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:03.700]   and their community is helping them work
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:04.700]   through their baggage.
[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:07.820]   And honestly, their community may be better able
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:10.620]   to speak into whether or not this is a deal breaker
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.860]   or hey, you're healing.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:14.620]   - Yeah, community's gotta play, here it is.
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:15.580]   Community's gotta play a role in that.
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:16.940]   It's this simple.
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:18.580]   People tell me all the time, I'm struggling with pornography.
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.580]   I say all the time, no, you're not, you're not struggling.
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:21.780]   You're just looking at porn.
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:22.900]   That's different.
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:25.020]   Like struggling looks like creating barricades
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:27.020]   so that you can't get to it though you want to.
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:28.260]   That's struggling.
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:31.380]   Looking at it is different than struggling, okay?
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:35.420]   And so if you're looking at it, break up.
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.580]   If you're struggling well, you're building barricades,
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:39.420]   you're not looking at it though you want to
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:41.820]   and you're having God deal with that desire
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:43.660]   and you're pursuing him and you're victorious
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:46.580]   in your pursuit of him, awesome.
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:49.380]   And so replace pornography with whatever is that struggle,
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:52.380]   eating disorder, materialism, whatever it is.
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:55.540]   I mean, if you're working and growing in that, great.
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:58.940]   If you're not, there's no better time to work on that
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:01.220]   and community's key, as David said.
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:02.060]   - That's excellent.
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:03.580]   So this will be the last question.
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:04.940]   But really, all of these questions
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:07.220]   can be answered in community.
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.900]   I mean, a lot of them, there's no mystery or secret.
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.580]   It's amazing and godly.
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:14.300]   I know personally all of you to be.
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:17.980]   A lot of these scripture can just address fairly clearly
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:20.260]   and you guys don't have any secret keys or sauce
[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:21.100]   that allows you to do them.
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:23.580]   So if you asked a question, we didn't answer it,
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:25.460]   we would love to and we'd encourage you
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:26.300]   to go to your community.
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.820]   If you don't have one, we'd encourage you
[00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:30.620]   to be plugged into a body and have community.
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:32.660]   And so this question, there was a number of questions
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:37.340]   that came in just about the crazy teaching last week
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:41.060]   that was at the porch and this pastor who had gone rogue
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:43.780]   up here and taught this ridiculous bomb
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.460]   of a message on divorce.
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:47.820]   And so JP, could you add any clarity
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:50.940]   to just divorce, remarriage,
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:54.820]   and what does the Bible say about it?
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:56.980]   - We have removed him from, no.
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:58.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.940]   - This will be my last porch here.
[00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:03.340]   - This is actually a farewell party.
[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:04.180]   I mean, here's what I would say.
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:05.660]   I listened to the message yesterday.
[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:06.980]   I was so encouraged, bro.
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:09.300]   So encouraged by the way you handled that text.
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:12.580]   It's such a hard topic and people hate you for it, man.
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:13.620]   I mean, they will.
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:16.980]   No one likes to be told things different
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.020]   than the desires of their heart.
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:23.020]   And so that message, thank you for handling that well, yeah.
[00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:28.460]   (congregation applauding)
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:30.300]   - I mean, it was really hard.
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:31.780]   It's been a hard week for our whole team
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:32.780]   because of how much.
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:34.740]   - Here's why, here's why it's been a hard week.
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.660]   So we got lots of emails.
[00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:38.360]   You quantified lots, like a dozen.
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.940]   (congregation laughing)
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:42.580]   And let me just say this real specific.
[00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:43.420]   - Painful dozen.
[00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:45.140]   - Let you into our world.
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:47.660]   They're long emails.
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:49.580]   You know why they're long?
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:52.260]   Because everybody, and this is not a judgment.
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:53.900]   So like if you sent that email, know that.
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:55.840]   Like we love that you sent that email.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.600]   But I wanna give the rest of you a perspective
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:58.740]   into those emails.
[00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:02.140]   They're all long because everybody wants to tell you,
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:03.140]   hey, this is my story.
[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:04.020]   And your story matters.
[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:05.980]   I want you to know that God cares about your story.
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:09.420]   But what you're doing, you're justifying.
[00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:10.380]   You're saying, hey, this is why.
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:11.740]   Man, my husband was abusive.
[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.100]   My wife was abusive.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.580]   She cheated on me with my best friend.
[00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:19.700]   Her and the pastor, you know, whatever that was, right?
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:21.140]   And it's like, this is my story.
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:22.860]   You don't understand.
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:23.820]   This is my story.
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:26.060]   You don't know what happened to me.
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:26.900]   It's different.
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:30.200]   And I would just say, God's so much bigger than that.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:33.620]   And what I heard David say, very appropriately,
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:36.820]   and I support him 100% because he's teaching the Word.
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:38.340]   And a lot of people, like people wrote in,
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:40.980]   like what's Watermark's real stance on divorce?
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.700]   It's like, well, it's just the Bible.
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:44.900]   Like, Watermark's stance is just what the Scripture says.
[00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:47.060]   It's not that Watermark's stance, it's the Bible's stance.
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:47.900]   You know?
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:49.260]   There's not like this unique, and yeah,
[00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:51.180]   not all churches are going to teach that.
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:53.580]   You're gonna have churches that have said,
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.620]   hey, bought into cultural, have a cultural worldview.
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:57:01.020]   But here's what I would say, is you've gotta ask the question.
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:02.540]   What I heard David appropriately say,
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:04.140]   is you need to wrestle with this.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:07.060]   So if divorce is a part of your story,
[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:09.560]   you more than anybody else should be an expert
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.620]   on what the Scriptures say about it.
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:13.500]   And so wrestle with those Scriptures,
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:15.860]   because the Scriptures have a lot to say about it.
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:19.500]   In Matthew 19, Matthew 5, 1 Corinthians 7.
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.860]   We have a lot of Scriptures to inform
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:24.200]   our idea of what that looks like.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:27.340]   I believe David handled that text really, really well.
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.140]   And so what happened is some of you heard,
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.060]   I need to go and reconcile to my spouse
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:35.180]   who was abusive and crazy and Satan himself in the flesh.
[00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:38.540]   And I would say, I want you to understand
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:42.780]   that the only options are not divorce or be abused.
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:44.900]   Those are not the only options.
[00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:47.500]   I mean, and so nobody, it is not God's desire
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:49.620]   that you would be in an abusive relationship.
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:50.920]   That is not God's desire.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.220]   But it may be God's desire to save your abuser.
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:57.340]   I was an abuser, okay?
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.340]   I was an abuser, like that's my, I mean,
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:02.220]   I was an adulterer in the form that I was a sex addict,
[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:04.140]   looking at porn all the time,
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:06.860]   verbally abusive, playing mind games with her.
[00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:08.780]   I mean, I was that person.
[00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:10.740]   And the Lord changed me, and so whoever you were,
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:11.740]   God is big enough.
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:14.500]   So you ask yourself this hypothetical question.
[00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:18.100]   What could bring God the most glory?
[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.540]   And I promise you, you show me the most wicked,
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:23.220]   evil man in the world, and I'll show you God,
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.660]   someone who God can take and make a missionary out of.
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:26.860]   See, also the Apostle Paul,
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:30.940]   who killed Christians, women, and children, okay?
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.380]   And so I'm just, we're just,
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:34.260]   we're not trying to put a heavy yoke on you.
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:36.340]   We're saying, hey, as you pursue God's best,
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:38.500]   you're going to win.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:43.500]   God's best is your best, all day, every day, I promise you.
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.740]   And so I know that that's frustrating.
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:47.260]   I know that you hear that, and we,
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:49.140]   David, I know you've had some great meetings with folks.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:51.420]   I mean, some of you, I'm so proud of you.
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:53.060]   I mean, some, there were folks who were angry,
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:55.140]   and then we met, and it was just like, you know what?
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:57.100]   I'm gonna start praying for my ex-husband.
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.020]   I'm gonna start praying for my ex-wife.
[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:00.860]   I'm gonna start praying the Lord would save 'em,
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:02.300]   and change their hearts.
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:05.020]   And I think God is up in heaven,
[00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:08.460]   saying that's what honors me, and that honors me.
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:10.020]   And so just wrestle with the text.
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:12.820]   If you, if divorce is a part of your story,
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:14.660]   you should be an expert on the topic.
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:16.780]   I'm going to go ahead and tell you.
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:18.860]   There are tons of churches that would just say,
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:20.860]   oh yeah, no big deal, divorce, no big deal.
[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:22.620]   And I'm just, I'm telling you as lovingly as I can,
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:24.540]   it's just not what the Bible says.
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:27.100]   It's just not what God says, so.
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:28.740]   - And that's, what you just said, though,
[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:31.380]   is maybe the first step in pursuing reconciliation.
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:34.420]   I think a lot of people who had an abusive relationship
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:37.260]   heard you need to pursue reconciliation,
[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:39.900]   is we're telling them to walk back into an abusive,
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:41.580]   violent, and we're just saying, hey,
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:44.280]   that may look like praying, God, save him,
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.660]   while I stay physically separated from him.
[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.260]   - Pray for them, be in community,
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:49.940]   have your community speak into this.
[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:52.580]   I mean, it's not, we would not advise you to leave here
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:54.220]   and run back to that abuser and say,
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:55.980]   hey, I'm here, I'm back, you know.
[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:57.780]   That's not the counsel.
[00:59:57.780 --> 01:00:01.020]   And so be wise in that, and if we can speak more,
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:03.020]   if we can speak more clarity into that,
[01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.260]   just know that we're willing to, we'd love to, okay?
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:07.300]   And we know that everybody's story's unique,
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.660]   and we can imagine, we can think with our minds,
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.900]   but here's the absolute worst case scenario.
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.480]   You're not gonna surprise us.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.760]   You know, my husband was a murderer and crazy,
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.900]   and he lied to me, he was a con artist,
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.700]   and I would say, man, out of everybody in the world,
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.680]   you chose that one, and so we just need to think through
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.100]   what God would do now or could do now
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:28.580]   to bring glory to himself.
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:29.760]   I'm not trying to make you feel guilty.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:30.900]   There's no guilt here.
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.620]   I'm just saying, let's follow the Spirit
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:34.380]   and see what God could be doing,
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.260]   what he might be up to, 'cause I've seen him
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:37.940]   do some crazy things.
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:41.420]   He took this sex addict, crazy fool,
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.660]   and made him a pastor.
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:43.820]   Not that that's the end all, be all,
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.140]   and he's still at work in my heart,
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:49.220]   but he can do some crazy, crazy things.
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:51.980]   And so, I'll just wrap this up.
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:53.620]   I'll say this.
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.300]   Thank you guys for being here
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:57.060]   and just sharing wisdom with us.
[01:00:57.060 --> 01:01:00.220]   (audience applauding)
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:06.060]   I remember, if you've been with us for a while,
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.420]   you've heard this story, but I remember our wedding day,
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:14.420]   and it was 2004, and I remember being up there.
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:17.860]   I love Jesus.
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:21.540]   She came down the aisle, and I just was like,
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:23.740]   man, I got the prize.
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:27.860]   And the guy up there, we read some scriptures to each other.
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:29.780]   We talked about how much we love God
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:30.620]   and how much we love each other.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.740]   And I remember, you may kiss your bride,
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:35.060]   and they played that music, and we walked down the foyer
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:37.540]   at Truett Seminary there on Baylor's campus.
[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:38.980]   And we were sitting in the foyer,
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.500]   and I held you in my arms,
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:43.500]   and I remember praying over us, and just where I was,
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:44.940]   and I remember praying specifically,
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:47.220]   Lord, thank you so much that you allowed me
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.420]   to escape the consequences of my sin.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:53.360]   God, I mean, just how merciful are you
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.500]   that you allowed me to escape the consequences of my sin?
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.540]   And specifically, I was thinking like a child
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:02.220]   without a wedlock or an STD or a psycho ex-girlfriend
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:03.460]   waiting to kill me outside.
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.940]   Like, those were the things that were going through my mind.
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:07.500]   And I was just like, you know, there's none of these things.
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:08.940]   Like, God, I win, you know?
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.220]   Your grace is enough, and your grace is sufficient.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:14.740]   And we got into two years of marriage,
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:18.860]   and I realized how messed up I was because of my past.
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.340]   And like, I had no idea how to love this woman.
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:22.900]   I had no idea.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:23.940]   I didn't know the first thing.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.940]   I never, I had, I mean, I had every relationship
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:27.780]   I'd ever been in.
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:29.100]   I broke up as soon as it went south
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.420]   and jumped into another one.
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:31.660]   I was so codependent.
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:34.940]   And now I'm in this covenant relationship with her,
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:37.980]   with God, and I have no idea how to be here.
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:39.220]   And it was a complete mess,
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:41.500]   and the divorce word was being thrown around,
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.340]   and we were fighting all the time.
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:47.100]   And I mean, it was absolute torturous misery.
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:49.220]   I mean, me, not even her, me.
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:52.100]   I mean, we're both broken, but mostly me.
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:56.220]   And so I want you to know
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.540]   that you're not getting away with it.
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.420]   No one does.
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:01.220]   You're not getting away with it.
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:02.660]   And I don't say that so that you feel guilty.
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:03.820]   I say that because there's nothing
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:05.500]   that would bring me more honor.
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.420]   There's nothing that would bring me more joy
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:10.180]   than 1,500 healthy marriages walking out of this room.
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:13.340]   And it's game time, folks.
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:14.460]   This was a fun series.
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:17.460]   It's time to pursue God with all your lives.
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.500]   We will change this world if you do that.
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.180]   We will wreck shop in this place.
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.780]   God will change this world through you.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:27.580]   But there is some growing up that has to do,
[01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.340]   that has to happen.
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:31.820]   And so bring him your junk right now.
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:32.740]   I don't care who you are.
[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:34.300]   I don't care what you've done.
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.500]   He can handle it.
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:36.460]   You bring it to him right now.
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:37.620]   You say, God, I'm done.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.300]   Man, I know that I have not been respectful
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:41.900]   and honorable to your daughter, my sister,
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:43.900]   who you told me is like my sister.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.660]   I know that I have not fleed sexual immorality.
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.860]   God, I know that I am a codependent.
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:51.180]   Lord, I know that I have been promiscuously,
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:55.700]   I have been promiscuous with my words and my heart,
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:58.260]   maybe not even sexually, maybe not even physically,
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.820]   but I have let my heart drift.
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.660]   I've been in an imaginary relationship with,
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:03.780]   God, I know I've sinned against you in these ways.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.820]   Father, would you fix this?
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:07.540]   And if you're not in community, get in community.
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:08.700]   That's key.
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.860]   And begin to confess your sins
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:13.060]   and watch him change your life.
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:14.500]   He did that for us.
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.520]   I know he did that for you guys.
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:17.980]   And I know you guys have always been holy,
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:20.060]   so we're glad you're here.
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.340]   - No, the toe thing.
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:22.660]   You didn't hear about the toe thing?
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:23.740]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:25.220]   And we do need to-- - And we champion.
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:26.700]   - We do need to talk about that toe thing.
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.500]   That was off script, Shane.
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.420]   - Beat it dirty.
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:32.260]   - Hey, but we love you guys.
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.100]   Let me pray.
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:35.980]   And after we pray, you guys do a song
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:37.700]   and we'll just close and end in worship.
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:38.700]   Is that cool?
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.980]   Okay.
[01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:40.820]   Father, we do.
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:46.980]   But I pray that everyone here that desires a spouse,
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:49.380]   Lord, that we would give them one.
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:51.420]   Someone who loves them,
[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:54.180]   someone who loves you more than them.
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:55.540]   And Father, before you do,
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:57.340]   would you make them someone who loves you
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:01.180]   more than they love their spouse?
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:05.220]   And Father, there's some folks here,
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.420]   we've been saying some crazy things
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:07.740]   and Jesus was thrown out a lot.
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.380]   And there's people here that don't know
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:10.460]   you through your son.
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:12.720]   Lord, would you save them?
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:16.980]   Father, would your spirit convict hearts,
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:20.420]   folks who slept with someone last night or this weekend,
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:23.340]   and someone who looked at porn yesterday.
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:26.500]   Lord, would your spirit just,
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.740]   would you just give them a new heart?
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.620]   There's no, listen, Christ died for that.
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:34.500]   You don't, you tell us in Paul's letter to the Corinthians
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.220]   that you're no longer counting our sins against us.
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:38.460]   How crazy is that?
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:39.380]   It's incredible.
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:42.980]   So Lord, thank you just for the way that you love us.
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:45.820]   Thank you for the son that you gave for us.
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:48.540]   Thank you for the things you've done for us.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.660]   And Lord, we'd love to sing to you
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:51.620]   and pray that you'd be honored.
[01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:53.180]   I pray that our lives would be songs to you,
[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:55.420]   but right now we just wanna sing to you.
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:56.620]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[01:05:56.620 --> 01:06:00.200]   (congregation applauding)
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.780]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:12.780]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
