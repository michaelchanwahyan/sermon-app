1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,320
 - Love it, hey, welcome friends in the room,

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,540
 friends of Fort Worth, Houston, El Paso,

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,580
 Rogers, Arkansas, Phoenix, wherever you're joining us from,

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,420
 we're so glad that you're here,

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,940
 and especially friends here, we're glad that you are here.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,460
 Tonight, we have got a treat, a friend of ours,

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,340
 a young adult pastor in town named Tripp Lee is joining us,

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,660
 we're gonna take a departure,

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,380
 and he is from Concord Church,

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,900
 a church that we love dearly.

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,580
 So will you guys put your hands together for Tripp,

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,380
 who's coming to teach us from God's word.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,380
 (audience cheering)

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,860
 - Thanks, man.

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,140
 All right.

17
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,500
 How's everybody doing?

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,820
 (audience cheering)

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,100
 Good, excited to be here with you tonight.

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,220
 Um, I just wanna shout out real quick,

21
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,740
 my wife is here, y'all say hi Jess.

22
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,020
 - Hi Jess.

23
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,500
 - And we also got some folks from Concord,

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,660
 some of our young adult leaders

25
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,940
 who are here hanging out in the front,

26
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,140
 y'all just make some noise for them real quick,

27
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,980
 hanging with us.

28
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,220
 (audience cheering)

29
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,580
 Excited to be here with y'all.

30
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,780
 One of the ways that we know

31
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,380
 there may be some cultural difference

32
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,900
 between the churches is

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,320
 that when the sports activities were listed,

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,520
 it was like soccer and softball,

35
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,520
 and ultimate frisbee,

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,940
 and spike ball.

37
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,180
 What is spike ball?

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,660
 I've never even heard of that.

39
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,500
 There are whole sports

40
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,140
 that y'all are keeping from black people.

41
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,820
 All right, first,

42
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,420
 ours would have been like basketball,

43
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,660
 three on three basketball,

44
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:52,020
 knockout, you know, those kinds of basketball related things.

45
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,060
 Again, I'm excited to be here with y'all tonight

46
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,180
 and to preach God's word.

47
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,540
 I'm grateful for Watermark,

48
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,340
 grateful for the porch,

49
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,420
 love what y'all are doing

50
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,460
 and excited to serve you.

51
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,220
 So I wanna pray one more time

52
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,900
 and we'll dive right in.

53
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:11,040
 Father, we thank you so much for your word.

54
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,020
 God, thank you for everybody who's here tonight, Lord.

55
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,580
 Thank you for bringing them.

56
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,940
 God, we know that you love them,

57
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,020
 you care for them, Father.

58
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,060
 So we pray this will be a good use of our time.

59
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,420
 We pray you would speak through your word, Father.

60
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,260
 We pray you would unearth the stuff in our life

61
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,580
 that doesn't look like you.

62
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,140
 God, I pray for my friends who don't know you,

63
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,340
 help them to see you, God.

64
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,740
 I pray for my friends who know you,

65
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,460
 help them to see you more.

66
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,000
 We ask in Jesus' name, amen.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,660
 Amen.

68
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,740
 Well, David just gave me a,

69
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,580
 just told you real quick who I am,

70
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,700
 just to tell you a little bit more

71
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,980
 so you know who you're listening to.

72
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,860
 I'm from Dallas, grew up here,

73
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,260
 lived a couple other places before I just came back.

74
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,980
 But God has been really gracious,

75
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,940
 and when I was really young,

76
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,000
 I was maybe about 14 years old,

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,780
 the Lord took someone like me,

78
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,580
 who I had assumed, because I grew up in Dallas,

79
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,340
 which as you know is a really churchy place,

80
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,420
 and I grew up just assuming that I was a Christian,

81
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,500
 just because I went to church with my family

82
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,380
 and I had repeated a prayer after a children's pastor,

83
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,940
 and that made me think that I was a Christian.

84
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,460
 And so I assumed it for a long time,

85
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,840
 and then fast forward,

86
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,260
 you know, I got drugged to church by my parents

87
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,460
 when I was 13 and 14,

88
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,580
 and you know, there was a sign up

89
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,740
 for like a summer retreat for the youth,

90
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,460
 and I was like, I'm not trying to sign up for that,

91
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,500
 and then I seen some cute girls in line,

92
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,020
 I was like, I'm gonna go sign up for that,

93
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,860
 and I did.

94
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,460
 [audience laughing]

95
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,900
 Really bad reasons, but the Lord had better ones,

96
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,540
 because the youth pastor at Concord,

97
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,900
 Concord is a church where I met Jesus,

98
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,660
 and the youth pastor was a good youth pastor,

99
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,420
 meaning we did more than just have fun,

100
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,700
 he also opened a Bible and preached the gospel of Jesus.

101
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,800
 And as he opened a Bible and preached the gospel,

102
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,420
 the stuff that I hadn't understood

103
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,400
 that I assumed about myself being a Christian before,

104
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,700
 about who God was, who I was, what Jesus did,

105
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,620
 the Lord made that stuff clear to me.

106
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,140
 And so since then, the Lord has given me the opportunity

107
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,600
 to be able to, yeah, do what my heart beats for,

108
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,300
 which is I wanna help people see the same Jesus

109
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,820
 that I've been shown.

110
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,180
 And so I'm praying we have the opportunity

111
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,180
 to do that tonight, I've tried to do that in a lot of ways,

112
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,820
 with music and with preaching God's word,

113
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,060
 and I'm excited to do that tonight.

114
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,500
 What I wanna talk about tonight is the state of your faith.

115
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,000
 I wanna talk to you about the state of your faith,

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,140
 and it'll become clear what I mean by that.

117
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:42,060
 One of the problems with talking about something like this,

118
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,500
 one of the problems with how we think about our faith

119
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,660
 is this, is that those who call themselves Christians,

120
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,380
 we sometimes see our faith as a finished product

121
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,700
 instead of a work in progress.

122
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,060
 We think about our faith, we just think of it

123
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,420
 as a finished product instead of a work in progress,

124
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,900
 and when we are confused about what stage we're in,

125
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,340
 everything is thrown off, and this is in every area

126
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,940
 of our life.

127
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,920
 So we're all familiar with the phrase

128
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,540
 that kids will say on a long trip.

129
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,820
 What is that phrase?

130
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,060
 Are we there yet?

131
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,960
 You know, before I had kids, I thought that this was fake.

132
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,320
 I thought this was like a funny thing in movies,

133
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,160
 and if you don't have kids, I just wanna let you know,

134
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,080
 this is real.

135
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,320
 The kids actually say this, and they say it so often

136
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,720
 that you really wanna be like, if you wanna be there,

137
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,120
 you can just get out right now,

138
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,460
 and we can just keep going where we're going.

139
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,500
 But kids ask that over and over again,

140
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,440
 but it's not just kids.

141
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,400
 We all do this too in different ways.

142
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,480
 Just think about when you're on a trip somewhere,

143
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,640
 even if you know, so like, you know,

144
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,640
 we're on the way from Dallas up here,

145
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,680
 and we're looking at our phones, and as we drive,

146
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,240
 even if you know how long it's gonna take,

147
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,200
 you keep looking.

148
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,020
 Even if you know you got a good 45 minutes left,

149
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,320
 you still looking like, well, how long we got left?

150
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,160
 Just hoping that it gets there a little bit closer.

151
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,940
 You know, some of us, while we're at school or at work,

152
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,740
 we spend more time looking at the clock

153
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,560
 than we do our actual work, just hoping that somehow

154
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,000
 we can will time to go a lot faster.

155
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,440
 We're constantly asking this question, are we there yet?

156
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,720
 And here's what happens.

157
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,340
 Once we assume that we've arrived, what do we do?

158
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,560
 We relax.

159
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,640
 You're happy when you make it to your destination.

160
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,680
 So it's a good thing.

161
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,300
 The only problem comes in is when you think

162
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,380
 you've already made it to your destination,

163
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,400
 but you're still on the way,

164
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,520
 because then you've relaxed way too early,

165
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,160
 when you think the task is over.

166
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,200
 So here's what happens.

167
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,680
 When we assume that our faith is just this one-time event

168
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,840
 that gets us entry into the kingdom,

169
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,640
 when we assume that with our faith,

170
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,800
 we've already arrived, that's a problem,

171
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,360
 because I think what scripture shows is

172
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,800
 just because we believed doesn't mean we've arrived.

173
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,440
 If you walk away with one thing today,

174
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,520
 I want it to be that just because you've believed in Jesus

175
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,120
 does not mean you've arrived,

176
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,800
 because when we treat our faith like a finished product

177
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,300
 instead of a work in progress, it will get neglected.

178
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,100
 It means we will relax too early

179
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,560
 because we think we will have arrived.

180
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,700
 So what I wanna do is I wanna look at just two points

181
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,720
 in a particular text.

182
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,880
 If you turn with me to 1 Thessalonians chapter three.

183
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,880
 1 Thessalonians chapter three, that should be on the screen.

184
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,040
 And I'll read.

185
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:30,280
 In this text, Paul is writing to some Christians

186
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,560
 in Thessalonica, and here's what he says to 'em.

187
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,360
 He says, "So when we could stand it no longer,

188
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,360
 "we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens.

189
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,520
 "We sent Timothy, who's our brother and coworker

190
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,200
 "in God's service and spread in the gospel of Christ,

191
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,000
 "to strengthen and encourage you in your faith

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,440
 "so that no one would be unsettled by these trials.

193
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,920
 "For you know quite well that we are destined for them.

194
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,940
 "In fact, when we were with you,

195
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,920
 "we kept telling you that we'd be persecuted,

196
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,280
 "and it turned out that way, as you well know.

197
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,460
 "For this reason, when I could stand it no longer,

198
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,400
 "I sent to find out about your faith.

199
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,400
 "I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you

200
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,480
 "and that our labors might have been in vain."

201
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,160
 We'll stop there, we'll read a little bit more as we go.

202
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,120
 But I wanna look at this passage in two points

203
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,120
 to remind us that just because we believe

204
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,200
 doesn't mean we've arrived.

205
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,200
 And the first one is this, your faith needs work.

206
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,440
 So I don't assume that everybody in this room

207
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,100
 is a believer in Jesus.

208
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,320
 But for those of us who are, I don't want you to think

209
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,360
 that because you're a believer,

210
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,600
 you've arrived at the end destination.

211
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,240
 So the first one is this, your faith needs work.

212
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,300
 Here's what I don't mean.

213
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,600
 I don't mean that Jesus will not save you

214
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,280
 until you do a bunch of good works.

215
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,080
 What we know about Jesus is,

216
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,920
 Jesus is perfectly capable of saving us on his own.

217
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,520
 And what Jesus did on the cross

218
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,840
 is he purchased our salvation.

219
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,480
 So I'm not saying for Jesus to save you,

220
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,020
 you have to add some stuff to what he's already done.

221
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,440
 But I am saying this, faith is not a one-time event

222
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,560
 that we look back on.

223
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,200
 Faith is a lifestyle.

224
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,760
 Faith is a lens that we see everything else through.

225
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,400
 Faith is fuel for every good work that we do.

226
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,380
 And so I wanna ask you how you would respond

227
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,700
 and if I was to ask you just a simple question,

228
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,540
 how's your faith?

229
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,380
 Just think about that for a second.

230
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,400
 How would you respond if I asked you, how's your faith?

231
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,280
 And when I ask you that, do you just think about

232
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,780
 some one-time event that happened a long time ago

233
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,420
 when you walked down an aisle

234
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,220
 and you repeated a prayer like I did when I was a kid?

235
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,940
 And I hope not.

236
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,220
 Because as Paul writes to these Christians

237
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,360
 in Thessalonica, he's writing to these folks

238
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,640
 who he went there and he preached the gospel, right?

239
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,220
 And Jesus saved some people.

240
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,820
 And what happens is people get mad at Paul

241
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,660
 for preaching the gospel.

242
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,020
 So he ends up getting pushed out

243
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,980
 and Paul writes back to them, right?

244
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,860
 And he sends Timothy to go check on them, right?

245
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,700
 So this is why he says in verse one,

246
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,820
 "We could stand in no longer.

247
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,000
 "We thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens.

248
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,600
 "We sent Timothy, who was our brother and coworker

249
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,140
 "in God's service and spread in the gospel of Christ

250
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,360
 "to strengthen and encourage you in your faith

251
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,960
 "so that no one would be unsettled by these trials.

252
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,760
 "For you know quite well that we are destined for them."

253
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,740
 Paul sends Timothy almost like a doctor making a house call

254
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,260
 to check on their spiritual health,

255
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,780
 to give them a little bit of a dose

256
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,780
 of what they need to continue to grow in health.

257
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,860
 But the fact that Timothy was sent to check on their faith

258
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,940
 should tell us something about what faith is like,

259
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,000
 that faith is something that needs to be sustained

260
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,440
 and checked in on.

261
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,560
 So I know y'all are in this series talking about self-care.

262
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,800
 Well, Paul wants the Thessalonians to understand

263
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,680
 that even though you've believed in Jesus,

264
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,440
 there's still some care that needs to happen, right?

265
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,160
 You're not at the end yet.

266
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,520
 So why does Paul think that the Thessalonians' faith

267
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,200
 would need to be checked in on?

268
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,860
 There's something specific about the Thessalonians.

269
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,640
 Well, what Paul understands about them

270
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,280
 is that their faith is fragile.

271
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,880
 That they are fragile, and the same thing is true about us,

272
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,420
 that we are fragile.

273
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,360
 I wonder if you ever think of yourself as fragile.

274
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,400
 That's not a way we like to think of ourselves.

275
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,820
 We like to think of ourselves as strong,

276
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,400
 especially dudes in here.

277
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,720
 We don't like anybody to see any weakness ever.

278
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,840
 That's why half of y'all get hurt

279
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,240
 every time you go to the gym.

280
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,720
 You just trying to live all kind of way.

281
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,320
 You know you, like you have never lifted this before, bro.

282
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,280
 Why do you think?

283
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,040
 Just praying before like the Lord is,

284
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,600
 if the Lord wants you to stop being a fool,

285
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,720
 that's what he would like.

286
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,040
 That's what you need power for.

287
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,560
 We don't like to think of ourselves as fragile.

288
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,800
 We like to think of ourselves as strong,

289
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,600
 and our pride blinds us to this.

290
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,440
 But there's a reason why when people trust Jesus,

291
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,200
 the Bible uses the language of new birth, right?

292
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,160
 'Cause when a new child is born, they're fragile.

293
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,960
 My sister had a baby recently,

294
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,000
 and I was just reminded that babies are so fragile.

295
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,720
 And you know, not to be rude to babies,

296
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,020
 but they can't do nothing.

297
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,280
 I mean, they can't do anything.

298
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,640
 You know, like my niece, she can't even hold her head up.

299
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,720
 It's like, if there's one baseline

300
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,820
 of something you can do for yourself,

301
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,400
 just keep your head up.

302
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,720
 And she can't even do that.

303
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,040
 And there's nothing wrong with her, she's just fragile.

304
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,120
 But this is the kind of language the Bible uses

305
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,080
 of those of us who just started to follow Jesus,

306
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,920
 is we're babies.

307
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,680
 We're fragile, we need to be cared for.

308
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,320
 And it's not that the life hasn't really begun,

309
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,380
 it's that that life needs to be cared for

310
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,520
 in order to be sustained.

311
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,120
 It needs to be looked after.

312
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,480
 And there are all kinds of strength

313
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,440
 that's needed to build that up.

314
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,880
 So let me give you another example.

315
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,480
 My wife is here tonight, and she's great at many things.

316
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,320
 And she has given me permission to say this.

317
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,240
 But my wife is great at so many things.

318
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,240
 I mean, I could give you a long list.

319
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,240
 One of the things that she's not good at

320
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,200
 is keeping plants alive.

321
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,680
 [audience laughs]

322
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,420
 My wife, she loves plants.

323
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,900
 I'm of the belief that plants are outside for a reason.

324
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,060
 That's why they should stay in the ground outside.

325
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,460
 My wife loves to have plants on the inside of our house.

326
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,700
 But what happens is, they always die

327
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,940
 terrible, painful deaths.

328
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,660
 And so she always kills them.

329
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,900
 And you know how the Bible says,

330
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,020
 you say you love your brother, but do you really?

331
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,220
 That's how I feel about her and plants.

332
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,140
 I'm like, you say you love them, but do you?

333
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,240
 Because she's a serial plant killer.

334
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,460
 And because of that,

335
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:30,240
 I felt like I had to put my foot down and be like,

336
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,940
 I don't think we can have plants in our house anymore.

337
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,180
 Because it's unjust.

338
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,080
 And though the exception I made was this,

339
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,020
 if those plants are fake.

340
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,800
 Because here's the great thing about fake plants,

341
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,120
 is that they're fake.

342
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,200
 And you don't have to pay attention to them.

343
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,720
 You can't kill a fake plant.

344
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,880
 You don't have to water it.

345
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,480
 You don't have to put it in front of the sun.

346
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,180
 You can forget that the plant exists for four years

347
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,680
 and come back and the plant looks exactly the same.

348
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,320
 Fake plants are wonderful in that way.

349
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,480
 And here's what happens.

350
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,260
 Is sometimes we treat our faith like it's that fake plant.

351
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,580
 Like it's something that exists

352
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,460
 that we can forget about entirely.

353
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,680
 That we don't have to water.

354
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,620
 That we don't have to put in front of the sun.

355
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,280
 It doesn't need anything to thrive and grow or flourish.

356
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,460
 And we expect to show up and for it to be

357
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,240
 in exactly the same state.

358
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,260
 But that's not true.

359
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,940
 Our faith is more like a real living plant

360
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,700
 that needs stuff in order to grow.

361
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,980
 That needs things in order to thrive and to flourish.

362
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,580
 And what Paul is saying is,

363
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,580
 I've sent Timothy to check up on you

364
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,340
 because there are things that need to happen

365
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,740
 if your faith is gonna survive.

366
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,140
 Timothy's checking in on them to see how they're doing.

367
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,660
 'Cause believing in Jesus doesn't mean that you've arrived.

368
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,580
 And so Paul understands that there are dangers in our world

369
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,700
 that are a threat to our faith.

370
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,540
 One to attack.

371
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,020
 And Paul talks about two threats.

372
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,420
 In verse three, he says he doesn't want anyone

373
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,860
 to be unsettled by these trials.

374
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,100
 In verse five he says,

375
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,800
 I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you.

376
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,100
 Our faith is under attack by temptation,

377
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,140
 pushback from the world and from the devil.

378
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,420
 So this is part of what is important about

379
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,900
 not seeing our faith as a finished product

380
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,660
 is not ignoring the threats.

381
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,400
 And so I wanna talk about those two threats he talks about.

382
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,700
 One of them is trials.

383
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,140
 This is one of the things that's a threat to our faith.

384
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,100
 He's talking mainly about affliction

385
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,360
 that comes from persecution.

386
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,940
 People opposing them because they follow Jesus.

387
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,400
 'Cause remember, Paul got pushed out of this place

388
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,820
 for preaching Jesus.

389
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,140
 And they were persecuted

390
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,420
 in ways much harder than we are today.

391
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:39,180
 But even so, that pushback can make us wanna leave Jesus.

392
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,660
 Because people do push back

393
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,200
 when you are serious about Jesus.

394
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,060
 I remember when I first started following Jesus

395
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,900
 in high school,

396
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,860
 there was a lot of people who,

397
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,820
 they were cool with me liking Jesus,

398
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,440
 as long as I didn't like him enough

399
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,940
 to actually do what he said.

400
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,580
 When I began to try to do what Jesus said,

401
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,460
 that's when people were like,

402
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,700
 Tripp, what are you doing, bro?

403
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,280
 You're doing too much.

404
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,620
 You extra.

405
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,460
 I'm a Christian too.

406
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,820
 Why you out here trying to be a super Christian?

407
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,460
 But I thought I was just doing what Jesus called me to do.

408
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,860
 He's saying these trials, this pushback,

409
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,100
 and the reason that that's a threat to our faith

410
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,620
 is because this human instinct

411
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,780
 to always wanna lead towards whatever seems easier to us.

412
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,020
 Right, if you touch the stove and it hurts you,

413
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,460
 try not to touch the stove again.

414
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,940
 In the same way, there's something in our minds and hearts

415
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,900
 that says, if I said that and I got this kind of pushback,

416
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,520
 I just won't say that anymore.

417
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,940
 So Paul is saying that could tempt us

418
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,740
 to walk away from Jesus.

419
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,240
 But avoiding trials and avoiding pain is not worth that.

420
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,380
 The other kind of trials too, besides persecution,

421
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,180
 that can threaten our faith, losing a loved one,

422
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:48,100
 losing a job, mental illness, disease,

423
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,580
 being broke, being lonely, right?

424
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,760
 That kind of stuff, those kind of trials can shake us

425
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,600
 if we're not careful.

426
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,940
 Not only trials, but also the tempter.

427
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,020
 He talks about the tempter, Satan.

428
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,020
 Satan can also tempt us away.

429
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,340
 Satan can make all kind of stuff seem

430
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,060
 more appealing to us than Jesus.

431
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,160
 He'll throw sin at us.

432
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,340
 He'll throw doubts at us.

433
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,180
 Satan, he has authority in this world.

434
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,300
 I don't know if we recognize that Satan

435
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,820
 is a master of false advertising.

436
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,820
 He knows how to make stuff look better than Jesus.

437
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,740
 This is why Paul is saying this is danger for the tempter.

438
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,700
 You ever seen like a commercial for some food on TV

439
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,480
 and then when you see it in person, you're like,

440
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,060
 that is not what y'all said.

441
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,820
 Every time I see Wendy's with them pictures

442
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,280
 of them perfectly square burger patties, I'm like,

443
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,340
 now y'all know them patties don't look like that.

444
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,900
 Them others is never square, they look real jagged.

445
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,260
 Or you know, one time me and my wife was watching TV

446
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,060
 and they, Taco Bell, was it Taco Bell?

447
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,480
 It's probably good that I don't remember where it was from.

448
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,560
 But they were advertising Mac and Cheetos.

449
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,460
 Ew, that's right, whoever said that.

450
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,940
 Ew, that's not how I would have said it, but it's true.

451
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,860
 Mac and Cheetos, which sounds disgusting,

452
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,200
 but they were trying to make it seem like

453
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,900
 it was revolutionary and amazing.

454
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,260
 And this is what Satan does,

455
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,620
 is he will all the time,

456
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,420
 Satan came up with Mac and Cheetos, just playing.

457
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,460
 No, but this is what Satan does though,

458
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,220
 is he will take something that's not good,

459
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,740
 that's not good for your soul,

460
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,620
 that's not good for the people around you,

461
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,020
 and he will try to sell it to us like it's good.

462
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,940
 This is what he does.

463
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,700
 And convince us that it won't make shipwreck

464
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,300
 of our life and our faith.

465
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,900
 And Paul is saying, look,

466
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,620
 I'm sending Timothy to check on y'all.

467
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,340
 My prayer is that trials and temptation

468
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,140
 won't have pushed you away from Jesus.

469
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,580
 And I'll say this, that whenever I've talked to people

470
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,420
 who don't wanna follow Jesus anymore,

471
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,760
 it's always because of one of these two dangers,

472
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,500
 because of some kind of pain or some kind of sin.

473
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,540
 That we're hurt by something,

474
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,980
 or hurt by somebody that makes us reassess

475
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,260
 what we think about Jesus.

476
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,260
 Or some kind of sin draws us away

477
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,020
 and it makes us reassess what we think about Jesus.

478
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,900
 And we are vulnerable in those moments.

479
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,660
 So if you are in a season of trial or season of temptation,

480
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,340
 I wanna ask you to guard yourself.

481
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,020
 To watch out for these dangers.

482
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,060
 I wanna encourage you to watch out for each other.

483
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,860
 Right, if you know a friend who's in a season

484
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,720
 of a lot of trial or temptation,

485
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,940
 I wanna encourage you to watch out for each other.

486
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,980
 Because when we understand we're under attack,

487
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,560
 it changes our posture.

488
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,780
 Changes our posture.

489
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,580
 Because most of the time,

490
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,140
 we don't live like our faith is actually under attack.

491
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,500
 We casually stroll and we should be treading carefully.

492
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,500
 Right, when you know your faith is under attack,

493
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,340
 you're careful.

494
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,940
 When you think everything is good, you're careless.

495
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,260
 And too many of us are careless with our faith.

496
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,500
 We don't think about the fact that it's under attack.

497
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,940
 My son, one time, he started to have some cold sores.

498
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,340
 He was like six months old,

499
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,940
 so we didn't think it was a big deal.

500
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,880
 But what happened was it got infected

501
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,420
 and he ended up in the hospital

502
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,900
 and he was in the emergency room.

503
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,940
 And so when we realized,

504
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,420
 oh, this is more than just cold sores,

505
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,860
 our whole posture changed.

506
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,240
 It went from just being at the house

507
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,460
 like it was no big deal

508
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,260
 to going to the emergency room to get it taken care of.

509
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,820
 But the problem would be if we treated the emergency

510
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,540
 like it was something regular.

511
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,300
 When you know something is under attack,

512
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,020
 it changes your whole posture.

513
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,420
 You're not careless anymore.

514
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,380
 So what are some ways that you might know

515
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,060
 that you're a little careless with your faith?

516
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:27,000
 Never showing up to worship with God's people.

517
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,460
 Not keeping up with relationships,

518
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,700
 people who are in your life who can check on you.

519
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,660
 Hiding our sin.

520
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,740
 You know how sometimes we'll have some sin,

521
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,580
 we're struggling with it.

522
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,300
 We don't want nobody else to know about it.

523
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,540
 And we like to hide it in the corner in the darkness

524
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,020
 where nobody else can see it

525
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,820
 'cause we think we're protecting ourselves

526
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,260
 and really we're putting ourselves in danger.

527
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,500
 Not reading the word at all,

528
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,060
 just kind of coasting.

529
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,020
 Not praying.

530
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,540
 I mean, there's so many ways we can be careless

531
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,380
 with our faith.

532
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,940
 And I'm not trying to call you to be afraid and fearful,

533
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,020
 I'm just calling you to be careful.

534
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,300
 I'm not saying retreat, I'm saying watch out

535
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,140
 because the danger is real.

536
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,060
 But God has said that he'll keep those who are his,

537
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,540
 like he'll hold on to us.

538
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,780
 But he's told us some ways that we need to hold on to him.

539
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,900
 I wanna look at verse six.

540
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,820
 This is what Paul says.

541
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,180
 He said, "I sent Timothy to check."

542
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,700
 Here's what Timothy found out.

543
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,060
 "But Timothy has just now come to us from you."

544
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,060
 He's brought good news about your faith and love.

545
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,060
 "He told us that you always have pleasant memories of us,

546
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,640
 "that you long to see us just as we long to see you.

547
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,980
 "Therefore, brothers and sisters,

548
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,040
 "in all our distress and persecution,

549
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,200
 "we were encouraged about you because of your faith.

550
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,440
 "For now we really live

551
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,240
 "since you were standing firm in the Lord.

552
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,400
 "How can we thank God enough for you

553
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,420
 "in return for all the joy we have

554
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,920
 "in the presence of our God because of you?

555
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,780
 "Night and day we pray most earnestly

556
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,380
 "that we may see you again

557
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,780
 "and supply what is lacking in your faith."

558
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,380
 I know these are a lot of verses, stick with me.

559
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,860
 Timothy brings back a good report.

560
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,300
 They're doing good, right?

561
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,340
 They're doing well.

562
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,660
 They have fine memories.

563
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,860
 So people are trying to convince them

564
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,260
 that Paul and them were lying to them.

565
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,060
 They remember what's going on.

566
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,180
 And he says, verse eight,

567
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,140
 "We really live since you were standing firm in the Lord."

568
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,980
 Before that, he was saying,

569
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,060
 "We didn't want you to be unsettled by trials."

570
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,900
 There's a big difference between being unsettled by trials

571
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,340
 and standing firm in the Lord.

572
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,220
 It's kind of like the terminal trains at the airports

573
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,020
 where before it moves, it always says,

574
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,380
 "This train is about to move.

575
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,300
 "Hold on."

576
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,500
 And it's always somebody who don't hold on,

577
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,540
 who just looking at their phone

578
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,060
 and the train goes and then they go.

579
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,860
 And I never feel bad for them

580
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,980
 because I'm like, "They told you to hold on, bro."

581
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,880
 So before it goes, I just kind of look around like,

582
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,980
 "Who about to fall?"

583
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,820
 Y'all should probably pray for me, that's not nice.

584
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,860
 Saying it out loud, it didn't sound very nice.

585
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,100
 But it's the same way.

586
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,820
 And that God is saying, "Look, this world is difficult.

587
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,540
 "There's threats for us to be unsettled."

588
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,540
 He's saying, "Hold on."

589
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,860
 And the way that we hold on, we hold on to God.

590
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,220
 We hold on to his people.

591
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,500
 We hold on to the stuff he's given us

592
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,620
 for our faith to be able to persevere.

593
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,580
 God's voice, God's people are telling you to hold on.

594
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,700
 And he says he wants to see them face to face

595
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,980
 to complete what is lacking in their faith.

596
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,140
 Again, the implication is something is lacking

597
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,300
 in their faith.

598
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,780
 Their faith needs to mature and grow.

599
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,280
 And so he's not saying there's something lacking

600
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,380
 from their faith for them to be saved,

601
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,940
 but he's saying that there's some maturity

602
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,860
 that needs to occur, right?

603
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,380
 So I just want to remind you that what saves you

604
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,980
 is not the power or perfection of your faith.

605
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,340
 It's not just 'cause you believe a lot.

606
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,900
 I want you to know that faith itself is not even a virtue.

607
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,900
 What saves you is not faith, what saves you is Jesus.

608
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,940
 Faith is not good unless you believe

609
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,380
 in something worth believing in.

610
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,020
 What saves us is Jesus.

611
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,100
 The object of our faith is what saves us.

612
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,460
 That faith needs to grow and mature.

613
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,900
 Jesus is a great savior, and so we want our faith

614
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,860
 to be in good shape.

615
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,680
 We know it's in good shape when it's thriving

616
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,080
 and growing and standing firm and holding on.

617
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,740
 Just before I go to this next point,

618
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,900
 I just want to ask you how often

619
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,780
 do you check in on other people?

620
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,600
 How often do you ask somebody else, how's your faith?

621
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,960
 [audience member mumbles]

622
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,280
 But the scripture seems to say that our responsibility

623
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,480
 isn't just our own growth, but one another, right?

624
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,700
 And I also want to say this, how often do you let

625
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,240
 other people ask you how your faith is?

626
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,080
 'Cause some of us, if someone sends you a text saying,

627
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,360
 how's your faith, you're gonna be like,

628
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,200
 how's your faith?

629
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,440
 What you mean, how's my faith?

630
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,860
 I'm good, how are you?

631
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,120
 I seen your Instagram, who is that?

632
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,960
 You know what I'm saying?

633
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,400
 Like, you don't have to do all of that.

634
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,680
 [audience laughs]

635
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,840
 But we want our lives to be open and vulnerable enough

636
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,280
 that we can check in on each other

637
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,640
 and we care enough to check in on each other.

638
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,040
 So number one, right, your faith needs work.

639
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,200
 Just because we believe doesn't mean we've arrived.

640
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,320
 And the last point is this, you need God to work.

641
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,280
 You need God to work.

642
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,640
 'Cause your faith needs work,

643
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,880
 but you cannot do that work on your own.

644
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,500
 I do not want you to hear me saying

645
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,080
 that we play some part in saving ourselves.

646
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,360
 Our faith needs work, but what we don't do

647
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,520
 is just kinda assemble our faith to some perfect level

648
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,760
 and then just present it to God.

649
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,280
 God is behind all of it.

650
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,840
 I'll give you an example.

651
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,880
 I know I talk about my wife and my kids a lot,

652
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,160
 it's because I like them.

653
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,520
 But here's the example, my son.

654
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,400
 My son, he's loved Legos as long as he could.

655
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,840
 And he, you know, when he was younger, he liked Legos,

656
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,840
 he just wasn't good enough with them to do anything.

657
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,960
 And so, you know, we would build stuff together,

658
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,320
 which really meant I would build it

659
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,720
 and I would let him put his finger on it

660
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,600
 and I would press it down, that kinda thing.

661
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,960
 And so there was sometimes he wanted to hurry up and do it

662
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,280
 and I just wasn't, I was doing something.

663
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,160
 And he'd be like, "Daddy, can I just do it by myself?"

664
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,920
 I was like, "I don't think it's gonna turn out the same."

665
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,040
 He was feeling himself.

666
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,400
 I was like, "I don't know."

667
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,540
 He's like, "No, can I just do it?"

668
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,840
 I was like, "Okay, go ahead."

669
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,120
 And so, you know, it was a Batmobile and he came back

670
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,160
 and, you know, it looked like a bunch of black bricks

671
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,240
 stuffed on top of each other.

672
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,280
 It did not look anything like the Batmobile.

673
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,000
 And here's the thing, he started to feel good about it

674
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,920
 and he thought he could go and do it by himself.

675
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,600
 And this is what we do with God, where we say,

676
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,880
 "Oh, I think I'm at a point where I can go

677
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,380
 "put my whole situation together

678
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,920
 "and present it back to God,"

679
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,960
 not understanding that it's really God

680
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,360
 who was putting this thing together,

681
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,480
 that he just graciously included you

682
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,880
 in the process of your growth.

683
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,280
 I mean, how foolish and proud can we be

684
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,800
 to think that we need Jesus to save our souls

685
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,900
 and then we could just take it from there?

686
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,940
 I can sanctify myself, I can grow myself,

687
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,460
 I can make myself more holy.

688
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,180
 You cannot.

689
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,320
 We're still dependent on God for that.

690
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,460
 We need God to work.

691
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,480
 That kind of I got this mentality

692
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,860
 may seem like it works in other areas of our life.

693
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,700
 It does not work with our pursuit of God.

694
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,100
 Listen to verse 11.

695
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,900
 He says this, "Now may our God and Father himself

696
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,200
 "and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you.

697
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,720
 "And may the Lord cause you to increase and overflow

698
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,700
 "with love for one another and for everyone

699
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,700
 "just as we do for you.

700
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,980
 "May he make your hearts blameless and holiness

701
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,500
 "before our God and Father

702
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,700
 "at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints."

703
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,380
 Amen.

704
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,100
 This is a prayer for them, right?

705
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,980
 So he's praying God will allow them to go visit them.

706
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,880
 Then he asked that God would cause them

707
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,820
 to increase and overflow with love for one another, right?

708
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,700
 That God would cause them, right?

709
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,380
 God is the one working this within them.

710
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,940
 And I want you to know that he's not just talking

711
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,440
 about their faith, right?

712
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,660
 They'll overflow also with a love for one another.

713
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,340
 I want you to know that faith is always

714
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,020
 side by side with love.

715
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,940
 It's almost like faith and love are best friends

716
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,980
 who are inseparable.

717
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,420
 Whenever you see one, you see the other.

718
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,020
 Right, the greatest commandment is to love God

719
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,060
 and to love neighbors.

720
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,620
 So Paul is saying he's praying they'll overflow with that.

721
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,540
 Jesus is always the main example we have

722
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,540
 of love in scripture.

723
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,520
 And we wanna look more and more like him.

724
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,180
 So sometimes when we begin to gauge

725
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,820
 even our own maturity as disciples

726
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,080
 and what our faith looks like,

727
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,320
 we'll just look to particular activities.

728
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,040
 Like oh, did I go to this and did I read this?

729
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,760
 But we rarely really look in our lives for love.

730
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,000
 Sometimes the questions you need to ask yourself

731
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,200
 to see whether or not you're growing

732
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,640
 and how you're doing with Jesus

733
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,120
 isn't just do I show up in a building sometimes,

734
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,780
 it's do I actually love my neighbor?

735
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,480
 Do I actually love my brothers and sisters?

736
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,300
 Do I seem to even be growing in affection for God?

737
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,880
 Right, is God at work in my life in that way?

738
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,200
 Faith and love are always side by side.

739
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,120
 Your love for God shows up in a way that you love others.

740
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,280
 And then the third thing he prays is this.

741
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,000
 May he make your hearts blameless in holiness

742
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,180
 before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus

743
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,180
 with all his saints.

744
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,500
 Blameless in holiness.

745
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,040
 With anybody, when they're just putting in,

746
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,600
 you know, like they're dating profile

747
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,860
 or something, dating that,

748
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,360
 be like how would you describe yourself?

749
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,400
 They'd be like, short, blameless in holiness, right?

750
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,460
 No one would do that.

751
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,640
 Because that's a high standard.

752
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,680
 Blameless in holiness means there is no fault

753
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,880
 to be found in you.

754
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,000
 There's nothing you can be blamed for.

755
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,120
 He's talking about a perfect holiness.

756
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,320
 You know, it's one thing for us to seem blameless

757
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,180
 in holiness before our friends, our coworkers,

758
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:40,000
 but he's saying may God make us blameless in holiness

759
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,100
 before our God and Father at the coming of Jesus.

760
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,940
 That is a high standard.

761
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,940
 We're talking about the God in the universe

762
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,780
 who knows everything about you,

763
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,300
 who knows what you're thinking right now,

764
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,700
 who knows your thoughts, your actions, your past,

765
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,980
 the stuff you feel like you can hide from other people.

766
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,700
 And he's saying that Jesus is gonna make us blameless

767
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,220
 in holiness before him.

768
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,900
 Again, if you have tricked yourself into thinking

769
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,140
 that you can do this on your own, I'm just not sure how.

770
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,940
 God has to do this work in us.

771
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,620
 I wonder if you ever think about your faith

772
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,260
 in light of the second coming of Jesus,

773
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,920
 that Jesus is coming back.

774
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,620
 And the only way that we have this eternal joy

775
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,860
 to look forward to is if we're blameless

776
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,620
 in holiness before him.

777
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,380
 But the good news is our future,

778
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,840
 that future of us being blameless in holiness before God

779
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,400
 is secure by what Jesus has already done in the past.

780
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,800
 Right, that you're not trying to come up

781
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,120
 with some new strategy and plan to get yourself

782
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,120
 to perfect holiness and blameless.

783
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,120
 You need to do what God has commanded you

784
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,380
 and it'll grow you in your faith,

785
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,480
 but at the end of the day,

786
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,160
 our confidence is in the work of Jesus.

787
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,120
 Our confidence is in the power of Jesus.

788
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,000
 So that some of us, it's hard for us to look forward,

789
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,680
 to have joy, because all we see is the ways

790
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,680
 that we fall short and we see our flaws

791
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,480
 and we see our failures, but I wanna encourage you

792
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,200
 not to base your confidence mainly on yourself,

793
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,240
 but in Jesus.

794
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,560
 When the Bible talks about our boast being in Jesus,

795
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,180
 our glory being in Jesus, our confidence being in Jesus,

796
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,880
 it's in part having to do with this.

797
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,940
 Jesus is gonna work this in you.

798
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,380
 Right, that he can finish the work that he begun in you.

799
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:28,040
 Blameless in holiness.

800
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,760
 If you're here today and you know Jesus,

801
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,280
 I wanna encourage you not to let your current sin

802
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,160
 overshadow the power and promises of God.

803
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,080
 Don't let the fact that you're weak doubt the strength,

804
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,680
 make you doubt the strength of Jesus,

805
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,480
 just 'cause you're weak doesn't mean that Jesus is.

806
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,840
 And I promise you, Jesus can do this work in your life

807
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,960
 and he's promised to.

808
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
 If you're here and you don't know Jesus,

809
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,080
 I wanna ask you whether or not you think

810
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,640
 that you can live a life that is blameless

811
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,800
 and holiness before God.

812
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,280
 Do you think that when the judge of the universe,

813
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:10,200
 you stand before him and he knows everything about you,

814
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,320
 do you think that you would come off

815
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,920
 as blameless and holiness?

816
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:21,960
 That's a really high standard, one that we cannot meet.

817
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,900
 There's plenty of stuff that we should be blamed for.

818
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,720
 Even when we try, there's ways we wanna do better

819
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,740
 but we find ourself falling short.

820
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,280
 We try and fail.

821
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,400
 We try to do better on our mistakes.

822
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,100
 But we know we can't, even if we could

823
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,840
 from this point forward live perfect,

824
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,360
 we can't go back in time and erase our mistakes.

825
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,520
 But I want you to know you can have hope

826
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,480
 that you will be blameless and holiness before God,

827
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,880
 before Jesus himself.

828
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,560
 You might say I'm guilty of making a lot of mistakes.

829
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,200
 I want you to know Jesus says I can make you blameless.

830
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,300
 You might say oh, but I've made a lot of people hurt

831
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,740
 but Jesus says I can make you blameless.

832
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,420
 You might say I'm guilty of lies.

833
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,140
 Jesus says I can make you blameless.

834
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,000
 You might say I'm guilty of lust.

835
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,660
 Jesus says I can make you blameless.

836
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,420
 You might say I'm guilty of bitterness.

837
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,220
 Jesus says I can make you blameless.

838
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,180
 You might say I'm guilty of unforgiveness.

839
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,940
 Jesus says I can make you blameless.

840
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,140
 Put whatever you want to at the beginning of that sentence.

841
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,300
 I want you to know at the end

842
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,720
 is this Jesus can make you blameless.

843
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,080
 (audience applauding)

844
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,860
 And not based on what you can do

845
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,320
 but what he's already done,

846
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,140
 that Jesus on the cross paid for our sins.

847
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,040
 And so if you don't know Jesus,

848
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,200
 I want to invite you to begin this journey

849
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,100
 that begins with faith in Jesus.

850
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,680
 In the perfect life he's already lived on our behalf.

851
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,320
 If you don't know him, I want to encourage you

852
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,840
 to talk to some folks tonight

853
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,400
 about what it means to know Jesus.

854
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,280
 So we're always asking that question,

855
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,240
 are we there yet?

856
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,720
 When it comes to our faith in Jesus.

857
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,360
 And I would say this, no, we're not there yet

858
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,440
 but we will be.

859
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,960
 We will reach the end and it'll be by God's power

860
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,920
 and God's strength.

861
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,180
 And the anticipation, knowing what Jesus is gonna do in us,

862
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,200
 knowing what Jesus desires, knowing what Jesus paid for

863
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,240
 should be part of what fuels our obedience.

864
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,040
 We should be excited about the opportunity to obey Jesus

865
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,880
 knowing that we're getting a little foretaste

866
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,600
 of who God saved us to be.

867
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,000
 I don't want holiness to feel like a burden to you,

868
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,980
 I want it to feel like an opportunity, a goal,

869
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,800
 something that God has in mind for you,

870
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,560
 a beautiful dream and vision that you get to be

871
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,060
 who God called you to be.

872
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,240
 I don't want you to feel like you'd be throwing away

873
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,760
 your years while you're young by being a holy

874
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,400
 and being obedient to Jesus.

875
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,560
 Instead, you'll be throwing away your years

876
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,760
 if you don't pursue holiness and obedience to Jesus.

877
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,600
 I want you to be who God created you to be right now

878
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,820
 and God has invited us and given us the chance to do that.

879
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,680
 Just because you believe doesn't mean you've arrived

880
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,480
 but by the power of Jesus, you can.

881
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,300
 Let me pray.

882
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,200
 Father, we thank you so much for Jesus.

883
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:14,240
 God, we know that the only solid hope we have

884
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,320
 is Jesus.

885
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,600
 God, we know that our only boast is Jesus,

886
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,120
 our only glory is Jesus.

887
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,200
 So Father, we thank you so much for Jesus.

888
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,600
 Father, I pray for my friends here tonight

889
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,040
 who don't know Jesus, Lord, that you would help them

890
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,520
 to see him in a way they've never seen him before.

891
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,200
 God, that they would see him as a gracious,

892
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,080
 loving, kind, powerful savior.

893
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,960
 Father, I pray if there's hesitation for what it means

894
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,200
 to let things go that we love to follow Jesus,

895
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,200
 God, you'd show us that Jesus is far greater.

896
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,360
 Father, I pray for my brothers and sisters in here

897
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,480
 who do know Jesus, Father, that you would help

898
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,940
 the power of Jesus to be shown as stronger

899
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,440
 than our own weakness, God.

900
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,840
 Father, give us the grace to love each other enough

901
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,380
 to help each other to grow in our faith.

902
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,840
 Father, we pray that you would be honored in our lives.

903
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,120
 Thank you so much for Watermark.

904
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,680
 Thank you so much for the porch, Father.

905
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,320
 We pray you continue to work in them, Father.

906
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,920
 We pray you continue to glorify yourself in them.

907
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,640
 And God, we pray that we care for these folks well.

908
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,480
 We ask in the name of your son, Jesus, amen.

909
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,560
 (congregation applauding)

910
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,320
 - You guys can stay standing for a second.

911
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,480
 I, man, what a tree, dude.

912
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,720
 It was awesome, so encouraging.

913
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,560
 I,

914
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,360
 I don't know if it's just women in general

915
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,300
 or I just have the same coincidental thing

916
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,140
 that I also married a serial plant killer.

917
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,480
 And as I was listening to that story

918
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,520
 and I was thinking about just the truth

919
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,320
 of just that idea of the fake plant,

920
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,280
 I couldn't help but think that there are some of you

921
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,560
 in the room that you think you have a living faith.

922
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,760
 And just like you could go into someone's house

923
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,160
 and you see a plant and you're like, is that real

924
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,000
 or is it not?

925
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,560
 You get a little closer and you see it

926
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,440
 and you're like, oh, that's a fake plant.

927
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,440
 Some of you, and I hope you hear this

928
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,240
 with as gentle of a way as I can say it

929
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,600
 and as loving as I can say it,

930
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,000
 you think you have a real faith and you have a fake faith.

931
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,420
 And the reason it stays the same,

932
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,480
 just like year after year after year,

933
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,120
 if you see a fake plant, it never changes.

934
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,400
 It's not growing.

935
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,560
 It's not changing at all.

936
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,320
 The reason that your faith,

937
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,960
 you're not seeing any growth and any change inside of it

938
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,760
 is 'cause you don't have a real faith.

939
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,440
 And maybe that's because you never actually accepted

940
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,140
 the free gift that God offers you.

941
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,720
 Maybe it's because you just grew up in church.

942
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,520
 Some of you, honestly, you've given up on the church

943
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,720
 and you've given up on Jesus

944
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,120
 and you grew up in the church and you grew up

945
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,320
 and you're like, I've been there, I went to youth camp,

946
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,320
 I tried all those things, and then, you know,

947
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,580
 it just didn't work.

948
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,840
 And so you walked away and you walked into the world

949
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,200
 and you step back into places like this tonight

950
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,300
 and there's scars in your back, rear view mirror,

951
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,920
 and you hear messages like this, you know, like,

952
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,880
 dude, I feel like I've tried it before and it didn't work.

953
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,040
 And the truth is, you never tried it to begin with.

954
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,800
 You never accepted that free gift that God offers

955
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,060
 'cause it's not just a one-time thing,

956
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,000
 it's a relationship, day after day after day.

957
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,400
 Let me be abundantly clear.

958
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,560
 You are not saved by anything that you do.

959
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,160
 You are saved by, in a moment, placing your faith

960
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,880
 in the object of Jesus, the Savior of the world

961
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,400
 and his death and resurrection on a cross.

962
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,480
 That is what saves us and that gives us access

963
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,160
 to have a relationship going forward

964
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,240
 and to have a living faith.

965
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,100
 But some of you need to hear me clearly,

966
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:57,040
 as lovingly as I can say it, you do not have a real faith.

967
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,280
 You have a fake faith.

968
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,920
 And the problem is not Jesus and it's not the church

969
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,800
 and it's not Christianity, it's that you've never

970
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,040
 tried those things.

971
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,720
 And you've never stepped into the relationship

972
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,320
 that God wants you to experience day after day.

973
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,560
 Not because he's angry or disappointed

974
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,220
 or anything other than crazy in love with you.

975
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,980
 And tonight is your night, man.

976
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,680
 And the God of the universe brought an incredibly gifted

977
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,960
 friend and co-laborer in Christ to come

978
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,100
 and share that message to you

979
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,240
 because he didn't want you to wake up

980
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,440
 and spend another day without experiencing

981
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,460
 a real living, growing faith.

982
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,820
 So if that's you inside of this room,

983
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,000
 there's gonna be a team of volunteers

984
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,800
 that'll be down front here right after the message.

985
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,320
 We would love to pray with you, we'd love to talk with you.

986
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,900
 There'll be volunteers that are wearing shirts

987
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,600
 just like this all throughout the lobby.

988
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,560
 Had to make sure that I'm wearing this shirt right now.

989
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,320
 All throughout the lobby, they would love to talk with you.

990
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,520
 If you're just walking through a season

991
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,240
 where you're walking through the valley of the shadow

992
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:04,160
 of job loss or heartbreak or a loved one dying,

993
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,720
 and we can just pray with you,

994
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,880
 answer questions you maybe have,

995
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,280
 maybe you're just wrestling with who is Jesus in general,

996
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,800
 anything we can do to serve you.

997
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,060
 If you wanna just know what the best tacos in town,

998
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,920
 we'd love to talk to you.

999
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,240
 Anything that we can do to provide for you,

1000
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,000
 we'll have men and women that will be down here

1001
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,120
 and spread all throughout, they'd love to connect with you.

1002
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,000
 In addition to that, there's something called First Step,

1003
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,560
 where if you are interested in making this place

1004
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,680
 that can feel so big, and we know that you walk in here

1005
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,760
 and it feels overwhelming and it seems like everyone

1006
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,400
 knows each other and they've all got

1007
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,040
 the secret handshake down, this is just not the case.

1008
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,840
 Our heart is to make this place that feels big

1009
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,820
 feel really, really small and help you get connected

1010
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,400
 with other people who you are checking in on,

1011
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,800
 just like he said, and who can check in on you.

1012
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,960
 And so one of the ways that we do that

1013
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,440
 is every month or so, we offer something called First Step.

1014
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,560
 If you wanna take the First Step and get it connected here,

1015
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,540
 you can go right outside of these doors right here

1016
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,060
 and you can get plugged into,

1017
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,920
 or be a part of something called First Step

1018
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,940
 of finding out what it looks like to take your First Step

1019
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,720
 and get plugged in here, answer questions,

1020
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,040
 hear some of the vision and values of Watermark.

1021
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,560
 In addition to that, we are so just grateful

1022
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,480
 for Tripp being here.

1023
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,800
 He will also be joining us at Awaken,

1024
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,800
 and hope that you will be joining us there as well.

1025
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,960
 There are limited, there have already been thousands

1026
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,680
 of tickets sold, and so we want everyone in this room,

1027
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,840
 and really everyone who wants to be there to be there.

1028
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,400
 And so I would take advantage of that opportunity

1029
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,480
 and go to awaken.live.

1030
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,120
 Can we give it up one more time for our friend Tripp?

1031
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:27,140
 All at Concord. (audience cheering)

1032
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,100
 And that is it, we love you guys so much.

1033
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,500
 Go in peace and love and serve the Lord this week!
