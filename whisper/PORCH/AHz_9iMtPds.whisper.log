[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (rock music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:25.480]   Check, check, amazing.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.600]   Hello, welcome friends.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.440]   Welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.520]   friends in Fort Worth, friends in the Woodlands,
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.360]   and in Houston.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.200]   I'm gonna read the text that we're gonna look at tonight
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.300]   as we kick off this brand new series.
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.280]   Thank you, Arts Team, or Team Landscape,
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.120]   for that amazing video.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.500]   You guys are incredible.
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.340]   Our volunteer Arts Team creates all the graphics,
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.200]   all the videos, and tons of other stuff that we do here.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.680]   And so, they're incredibly gifted,
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.620]   and they produce stuff like that.
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.240]   I'm gonna read the passage,
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.000]   and then we're gonna kick off this new series.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.840]   But let me read this.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.040]   This comes from Romans chapter one,
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.840]   starting in verse 18,
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.680]   and then I'm gonna pray,
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.140]   and we will dive into tonight.
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.500]   Paul says this.
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.140]   The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.380]   against all ungodliness and wickedness of people
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.320]   who suppress the truth by their wickedness.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.020]   Since what may be known about God is plain to them,
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.860]   because God has made it plain to them.
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.340]   For since the creation of the world,
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.140]   God's invisible qualities,
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.060]   his eternal power, and his divine nature
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.540]   have been clearly seen,
[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.360]   being understood from what has been made,
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.620]   so people are without excuse.
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.580]   For although they knew God, verse 21,
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.580]   they did not honor him,
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.320]   or they neither glorified him,
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.680]   nor gave thanks to him.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.220]   But their thinking became futile,
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.660]   and their foolish hearts were darkened.
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.820]   Although they claimed to be wise,
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.540]   they became fools and exchanged the glory
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.420]   of the immortal God for images
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.220]   made to look like a mortal human being,
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.900]   and birds, and animals, and reptiles.
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.180]   Therefore, God gave them over
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.420]   in their sinful desires of their hearts
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.420]   to sexual impurity,
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.520]   for the degrading of their bodies with one another.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.260]   They exchanged the truth about God for a lie,
[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.700]   and they worshiped and served created things
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.080]   rather than the creator who is forever praised, amen.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.920]   Let me pray.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.620]   Father, just as we do start this series,
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.860]   and we look back at the role that Christianity
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.360]   has played in our country,
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.060]   as we look at just the calling
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.340]   that you've placed on our lives
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.160]   as believers in Jesus, as followers of Christ,
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.240]   as it relates to living in a democracy,
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.200]   would you give us wisdom?
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.740]   Would you speak from your word?
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.320]   Would you move us in the direction
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.500]   that you would have us move?
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.900]   Would we listen and hear your voice tonight
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.020]   as we look back at some of the past,
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.620]   and in the weeks ahead as we just explore
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.740]   what does it look like for a Christian
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.120]   living in this republic, democratic republic,
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.500]   to faithfully engage in culture,
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.080]   to stand firm in the faith,
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.900]   and to showcase to a watching world
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.540]   what it looks like to experience
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.060]   the abundant life you call us to?
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.060]   Would you strengthen your church,
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.380]   and would you begin with us in this room?
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.200]   Amen.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.300]   A few weeks ago, I got to go on a date night with my wife,
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.860]   and we're in this season where we don't have
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.780]   a ton of date nights,
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.380]   and so this was something we were looking forward to.
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.220]   It was gonna be great.
[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.140]   We have a 10-month-old that comes along,
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.460]   usually because we don't like to pay for babysitting,
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.500]   and so we'll bring him along,
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.660]   and we're planning on going to Gloria's.
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.300]   If you have Gloria's in Fort Worth,
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.140]   you know what I'm talking about.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.960]   Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.660]   Free bean dip, let's go.
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.260]   Houston, I'm sorry, I don't know
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.220]   if they have that down there.
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.460]   So anyway, so we're going to Gloria's.
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.320]   We get there, it's the early bird special,
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.060]   'cause we got an infant that goes down really early,
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.220]   so we're there with like mom and pa,
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.460]   and it's five o'clock.
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.820]   We go in, we sit down.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.960]   My wife begins to put him in a baby chair,
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.960]   or an infant chair, whatever that's actually called.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.120]   They bring one over to the table.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.460]   We're sitting at this little four-top,
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.940]   me, my wife, the baby.
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.020]   She's putting him in the baby chair.
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.100]   She gets him all sitting there.
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.440]   All of a sudden, she goes to sit down,
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.440]   and the waiter has removed her chair from behind her,
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.860]   and she has no idea at this point,
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.060]   because the waiter was thinking she would sit over there.
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.780]   I thought the baby chair would go right here.
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.620]   He takes it, walks it right away.
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.540]   I didn't see it happen.
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.660]   She didn't see it happen.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.700]   She all of a sudden does not look back,
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.620]   and she doesn't realize what was there
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.940]   that is no longer there,
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.080]   and she goes in a moment from just moving.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.940]   All of a sudden, all I see is feet up in the air,
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:29.780]   and she's over there on the ground.
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.800]   I'm like, oh my gosh, what happened?
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.820]   I run over, I'm picking her up.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.980]   I'm like, gosh, she's so clumsy.
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.980]   I can't take her anywhere.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.860]   And it's not at all what I said.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.540]   And I'm like, what happened over there?
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.220]   She realized the chair had been gone.
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.820]   Everyone around us all of a sudden sees what had happened.
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.420]   It was like the people sitting next to us
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.900]   saw this whole thing happen.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.060]   So they're laughing and going, oh man, I'm sorry.
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.940]   Is she okay?
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.380]   I'm like, yeah, I think she's okay.
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.700]   The waiter comes back.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.820]   He's super apologetic.
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.140]   It ended up working in our favor
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.620]   'cause Gloria's comped the whole thing.
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.700]   Thank you, Gloria's.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.820]   And I was like, man, we're gonna do this at every restaurant.
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.820]   You've gotta go in there and move and just fall.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.460]   And it's not true at all.
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.500]   But it was one of those moments
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.140]   where what she had done is in failing to look back,
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.060]   I had to ask for permission to tell this story too,
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.100]   by the way, because it's like,
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.260]   in failing to look back and see
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.340]   what was behind her,
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.540]   and specifically to see what was no longer,
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.580]   what had once been there but was removed,
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.220]   in failing to look back and see what had been there once
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.760]   but had been removed, it led to her falling.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.580]   In failing to look behind her, if you will,
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.740]   and restore what had been taken away,
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.340]   bring the chair back,
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.920]   in failing to do that, it led to her falling.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.100]   Now why would I start with a random Gloria's table story?
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.460]   The reason is because as it relates
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.060]   to the state of our country,
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.700]   one of the most problematic things is that we as a country
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.340]   have failed to really look back,
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.200]   to be educated in a way where we look back behind us
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.960]   and we realize what has been taken away from us.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.700]   What was once there, specifically,
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.140]   as it relates to the Christian foundation
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.140]   that was behind us, and that creates all kinds of like,
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.060]   wait a second, I learned in school that this,
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.940]   we're gonna address those here in just a second.
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.100]   But as a country, we are experiencing
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.060]   and have experienced the reality
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.340]   that when we fail to look back at what was once behind us,
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.680]   specifically a Christian moral foundation,
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.400]   when we fail to look back and realize it's no longer there,
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.380]   we fail to restore it and bring it back
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.540]   and it is leading to the fall of our nation.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.900]   And so tonight, we're gonna explore just that very idea
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.620]   as we kick off this series, One Nation Under God.
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.360]   Tonight will not be a, it'll just be, honestly,
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.100]   a starter for this series.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.060]   And so it's gonna leave lots of different things
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.160]   on the table that we're gonna discuss in weeks ahead.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.700]   You don't wanna miss out on those.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.920]   But let me just get this out of the way as well.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.340]   Two things, one, this is gonna be an unusual night
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.560]   where it's gonna be scripture-light,
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.960]   we're gonna look at those verses,
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.900]   but beyond that, we're not gonna look at a ton
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.420]   because really, we're gonna teach and educate
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.540]   and attempt to inform all of us in the room
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.080]   on something that likely you will never hear taught
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.280]   outside of this tonight.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.460]   Not because it didn't exist,
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.100]   not because it's not very clearly a part of our history,
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.700]   but because everywhere you look,
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.020]   it's being taught in the opposite direction.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.160]   You're being taught something very not true with history
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.220]   and the opposite of what we're gonna talk about tonight.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.040]   So that's the first thing.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.340]   And the second thing is this is not
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.540]   a political message at all.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.580]   And so if you're in this message being like,
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.220]   I think I know what he's trying to get,
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.260]   what he's getting at here,
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260]   I am not getting anything other than what I'm gonna say.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.500]   In other words, this isn't me waving a flag
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.840]   for the Democratic Party, for the Republican Party,
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.680]   for any party, other than as our senior pastor says,
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.180]   the party of the lamb or the party of Jesus
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.020]   more than anything.
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.140]   And so that's what we're gonna explore tonight.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.540]   And so that may raise some questions.
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.060]   I'm gonna do my best to remove them,
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.700]   but we are going to look back
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:06.300]   and hopefully discover how to restore what's been removed
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.540]   so that we don't collectively continue to fall.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.180]   And so three things we're gonna talk about tonight
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.460]   or one of the overarching thing we're gonna talk about
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.300]   is what made America great in the first place.
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.140]   A lot of conversation has been going on about,
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.740]   hey, make America great again,
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.700]   and how do we make it great again?
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.740]   Again, we are not attaching to anyone's political slogan
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.420]   here, but we do wanna talk about
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.420]   what made America great in the first place.
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.280]   Has she been great?
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.780]   Specifically, we're gonna talk about what made her great
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.540]   and what will make her cease to be great,
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.260]   what will lead to her fall.
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260]   Specifically, the first question of is America great?
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.300]   So this is very, there's no scripture in this first point.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.820]   I just wanna prove to everyone in the room
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.940]   there's something unique that has taken place
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.820]   with the founding of the United States of America.
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.340]   And that it has become the most prosperous,
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.100]   most successful nation distinctly
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.020]   from the rest of the world.
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.420]   And here's some of the things that we know
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.140]   about has America been great.
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.980]   America is the most prosperous country
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.060]   that has ever existed.
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.380]   The gross domestic product,
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.660]   which is just like the income,
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.140]   if you took everybody's income in the room
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.340]   and everybody's income across the different nations,
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.060]   you compare them, how much money they all make,
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.420]   America makes more than every other nation on the planet.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.060]   Significantly more.
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.420]   If you were to combine second place,
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.100]   third place and fourth place,
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.620]   you would just barely have enough
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.820]   to match what America makes.
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.500]   We've been the most prosperous economic nation
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.340]   in the country.
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.500]   We are so opportunistic, we have such opportunity,
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.100]   the land of the free, we have opportunity
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.220]   where you can do anything.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.420]   We have such, which does not exist in many countries,
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.780]   where there's class systems.
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.020]   America is so focused on social mobility,
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.260]   we have a name for it.
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:48.260]   We have coined a name, it's called the American dream.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.060]   There's no like the Saudi Arabian dream,
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.940]   that dream does not exist.
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.900]   But we're so like, "Oh man, you can go for rags to riches,
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.100]   "anybody can become anything with hard work,
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.420]   "opportunity, chance, you can do it."
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.820]   By generally speaking.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:05.140]   We're the most internationally dominant country,
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.380]   at least in the modern era that has existed.
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.780]   Where we have won two world wars,
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.460]   arguably prevented a third.
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.660]   We've gone out of our way,
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.620]   not only are we internationally dominant,
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.100]   we have this thing where we do it with a conscience.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.740]   We go out of our way to help other nations.
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.860]   After we defeated Germany and Japan in World War II,
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.260]   if you remember from history class,
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.420]   we went back and helped rebuild them,
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.820]   using our money and our people.
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.180]   When the Soviet Union in the 1950s
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.340]   surrounded West Germany, if you remember the Berlin Wall
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.820]   and Gorbachev dared on this wall,
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.660]   if you remember all that,
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.700]   whenever West Germany was surrounded by Soviets
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.180]   and the Soviets said, "We're cutting off food,
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.500]   "we're cutting off supplies,
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.220]   "this will not be a free country."
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.540]   The United States said,
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.900]   "We don't like seeing bullies pick on little guys."
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:51.460]   We flew into West Germany 500,000 tons of food
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.500]   for 12 months.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.940]   We landed planes every 90 seconds
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.620]   because we said, "We are going to fight
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.140]   "for freedom to exist here,
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.740]   "and we do not like seeing little guys
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.020]   "picked on by big guys."
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.700]   We parachuted in candy for the children.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.740]   We have this international conscience
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.420]   that is a part really of even our dominance,
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.260]   so to speak,
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.300]   we're the only abstaining superpower that's ever existed.
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.860]   What do I mean by abstaining superpower?
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.060]   Superpower is kind of like somebody
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:16.900]   who rises on the world scene,
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.020]   who's like, "Hey man, it's all me."
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.580]   America, unlike other imperialistic countries,
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.260]   is the only abstaining superpower.
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.100]   We are not here to like,
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.100]   "We're gonna take Mexico,
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.260]   "we've been eyeing you for a while, we're taking it."
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.180]   That has never once crossed legislatively
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.020]   what you see in America.
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.220]   Versus like the British Empire,
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.020]   which said, "Hey, we're gonna conquer Australia,
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.100]   "we're gonna conquer South America, or South Africa,
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.820]   "we're gonna conquer these different places around."
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.140]   You still see ripples about,
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.300]   America has never been a superpower that is there.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.860]   We'll go in, we'll help, we'll try to bring peace,
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:47.940]   but then we leave.
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:53.340]   We're the most generous nation in history,
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.460]   by a wide margin.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.620]   America gives more in foreign aid than any other country,
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.780]   it's not even close.
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.300]   Are we the only country that gives money to foreign aid
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.540]   and to what's broken in our world?
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.660]   In our world, no.
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.860]   But out of the top 10 humanitarian relief organizations,
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.700]   out of the top 10,
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.980]   "Hey, these are the most generous organizations in the world,"
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.100]   all 10 are American.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.540]   America is not only generous in our funds and resources,
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.220]   we're generous in our acceptance.
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.860]   That anyone, I mean, it's a part of our national DNA,
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.060]   anyone can come to America,
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.220]   go through the process of immigration,
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.380]   become an American citizen,
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.580]   can begin to work, can pursue a job,
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.900]   and can make a living.
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.340]   It's written on Lady Liberty, the Statue of Liberty.
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.220]   This is what's on the bottom of it, you probably heard.
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.740]   "Give me your tired, your poor,
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.420]   "your huddled masses yearning to be free.
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:48.920]   "The wretched refuse of your teeming shore will take them.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.840]   "Send these, the homeless, tempest-tots to me.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.660]   "I lift my lamp beside the golden door."
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:59.620]   That does not sit outside of normal nations,
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.460]   but it's a part of our fabric of DNA.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.700]   We've done more for human rights
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.020]   than any other country in history.
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:07.860]   And you may be like, "No, no, no,
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.540]   "Europe's all about rights,"
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.060]   because we exported it to them.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.220]   There's never been a caste system in the United States.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.220]   There's never been, hey, if you watch "Downton Abbey,"
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.780]   where there's the lords and the whatever,
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:18.940]   there's never been any of that here.
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.020]   We believe that all men are endowed by their creator
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.960]   with equal rights.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.300]   We are the most pro-human rights that there's been.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.700]   Slavery is a dark part of our past,
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.680]   but it is a past that,
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.860]   in the midst of that terrible mark on our history,
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.600]   was Christians who said, "This is wrong,"
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.380]   and hundreds of thousands of Americans gave their life
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.180]   and spilt blood to eradicate it.
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.180]   We've spilt more blood to get rid of history
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.340]   or slavery than any other nation,
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.500]   because we believe in human rights,
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.120]   and we've exported it all around the world around us.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.660]   It's become the norm because America has led the way.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.780]   Education, other countries send their people
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.260]   to learn from our colleges.
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.740]   China, we think of China as, man,
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.780]   they're just so smart over there.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.560]   160,000 Chinese come to the United States
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.640]   to learn in colleges every single year.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.160]   They would send more if they could afford it.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.780]   Athletics, we're the most dominant athletically
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.620]   in terms of the Olympics that there's ever been.
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.820]   There's more American medals than any other nation.
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.340]   There's more gold medals than any other nation.
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.660]   Culturally, the world listens to our music,
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.580]   watches our movies, surfs our internet,
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.140]   uses our dollar bills or the American dollar,
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.340]   and speaks our language.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.320]   The international language of the world is English.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.460]   We brought democracy as it is known today into existence,
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.260]   and we perfected it, and then we sent it back
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.900]   to the monarch of France, Spain, Britain,
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.380]   and all over our world.
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:48.740]   We invented the telegraph, the light bulb,
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.060]   the motion picture or the movie,
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.060]   the airplane, the automobile, baseball, football,
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.900]   jazz, blues, rock and roll, computer,
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.060]   internet, cell phone, smartphone, iPhone,
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.620]   email, GPS, chemotherapy, and though we didn't invent
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.140]   ice cream, we did invent bluebell.
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.540]   (audience cheering)
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.500]   Yeah, these colors don't run, boom.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.540]   And Ben and Jerry's.
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:14.820]   America over the last 240 years has distinctly stood out
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.980]   on the world stage.
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.380]   I mean, there's no question.
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:22.680]   We are not in a time where we're the most pro-patriotic,
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.900]   you know, America everything, but there's no question.
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.980]   If you look around the world and you look at history,
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.360]   there's something distinct about our country.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.660]   So what made America great?
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.440]   It's clear that she has been great.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.500]   What has led to her success?
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.440]   That's the second question I wanna answer tonight.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.060]   And there's a few answers you could come up with.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.780]   Maybe it is the size.
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.180]   You got 360 million people.
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.800]   Maybe it's because we're just so big.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.420]   If that was the case, then you would see nations
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.540]   like India or China, you'd see other nations,
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.920]   Russia that have enormous populations
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.040]   also having incredible success.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.440]   It's clearly not the size of the country.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.960]   Maybe it's our model of government.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.240]   You know, maybe it's like democracy.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.760]   Maybe the fabric that leads to success,
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.580]   the secret sauce of America is democracy.
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.080]   If that was the case, then when democracy is introduced
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.120]   to countries, you would think they would flourish.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.120]   And see Iraq, where we set them free,
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.480]   we took down Saddam Hussein.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.040]   If you remember that whole thing with Iraq,
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.160]   what happened there is we went in,
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.340]   we took out Saddam, we were like,
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.300]   hey, democracy, go get 'em.
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.060]   And they were like, pfft, pfft, to one another,
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.100]   and it fell apart.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.340]   And that's what happened.
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.860]   That it's clearly not democracy
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.940]   and not a model of government that leads to flourishing.
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.060]   Maybe it's like geography.
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.140]   Maybe it's America, you know, we're in the West,
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.580]   North America, maybe it's just kind of where we are,
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.500]   you know, fertile and lots of different types of climates.
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.340]   Maybe that's it.
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:46.620]   If that was the case, then you would also expect
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.500]   to see the same type of success take place
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.580]   in South America and the countries down there,
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.820]   or in Mexico and in Canada.
[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.480]   And I'm not saying there hasn't been flourishing
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.660]   and they're part of the Western world.
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.780]   I'm saying there's something distinct about America.
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:01.620]   What is it?
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:05.380]   And we know it's not just like, oh, because the English,
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.740]   the English were superior to everyone else
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.940]   because it's just not the case.
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.100]   Other places that they landed and tried to introduce society
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.100]   they didn't flourish like America.
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:13.940]   What was it?
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.600]   What I wanna attempt to convince you
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.320]   for the next 20 minutes, if you will,
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.220]   is that it is the Christian moral foundation
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.640]   that has led to the incredible success
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.880]   that we've seen in the United States.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:29.060]   Specifically, there was something distinct about America,
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.900]   about the way it was founded,
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.680]   about the faith of the founders,
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.880]   about the principles they established it on.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.320]   So that we might look back,
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.280]   I wanna show you what is behind us
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.020]   by hearing from the voices of these men
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.660]   so that we in effort might be able to restore it
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.940]   to prevent us falling because we are falling.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:53.780]   And it's not hard to see beyond the presidential race
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.260]   that looks like an SNL skit.
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.740]   It's becoming harder and harder to tell
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.500]   what's the SNL skit and what's not.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.240]   And so we're gonna hear from the founders,
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.500]   why has America been great?
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.540]   Because of the Christian moral foundation.
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:05.760]   And a lot of you have been taught that,
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.260]   nah, I mean, they weren't really that Christian.
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.980]   Like, you know, Thomas Jefferson was kind of a deist, right?
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.020]   A deist believes that God is a clockmaker.
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.500]   He spun up the world and was like, peace out,
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.340]   I'll be back in a little while,
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.440]   take care of things for me.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.140]   That is not the faith of Thomas Jefferson.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.340]   It wasn't the faith of any of the founders.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.500]   So I wanna read some of the writings of them.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.340]   By and large, the founders that founded this country
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.340]   were Christian, not just in name.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:31.700]   They wrote of him in a way that was clearly,
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.700]   it was clear they understood the gospel.
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.800]   Were there outliers?
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.060]   Yes, Jefferson and Franklin to name two.
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.900]   But they were very much the minority,
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.980]   and even they were steeped
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.380]   in a Judeo-Christian perspective.
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.260]   They saw the world from a Christian worldview.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.180]   So let me read a few of them.
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.620]   Alexander Hamilton, here's one.
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.300]   Alexander Hamilton is famous right now,
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.800]   if you watched Saturday Night Live this past weekend.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.000]   The guy who is the head of the Broadway,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.980]   Alexander Hamilton, if you've seen the play Hamilton,
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.220]   that guy was leading SNL.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.540]   Alexander Hamilton, in his dying words,
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.960]   he was one of the secretary of treasurers,
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.880]   he's just founding father.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.140]   Here's what he said.
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.840]   I have a tender reliance on the mercy of the Almighty,
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.780]   through the merits or the works of Christ alone.
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:22.260]   I am a sinner, and I look to him for mercy.
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.420]   Pray for me.
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.260]   Our George Washington, our first president
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.760]   of the United States, kept a prayer book.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.740]   Inside of it, we get access to reading some of his prayers
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.500]   of this man who clearly understood who Jesus was.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.940]   There were so many to pick from
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.220]   that I just picked one of them.
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.300]   Here was one of them.
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.880]   Lord, I beseech thee my sins.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.580]   This is George Washington.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.840]   Lord, I beseech thee my sins.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.200]   Remove them from my presence,
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.240]   as far as the east is from the west.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.240]   Accept me, Lord, for the merits of thy son, Jesus Christ.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.280]   Bless my family, kindred, friends, and country.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.320]   Be our God and our guide forever,
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.440]   for his sake, the sake of Jesus.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.640]   Who lay down his life in the grave and arose again,
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.220]   Jesus Christ, our Lord, amen.
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.680]   Benjamin Franklin, who's like, oh man, he was a deist,
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.620]   he didn't even believe, you know, he's crazy Ben.
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.660]   Here's what he says to the Continental Congress
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.140]   as they're trying to write the Constitution.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.880]   And they were hitting a roadblock.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.280]   They were in disagreements with one another.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.700]   He turns and he says this.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.260]   I have lived, sir, a long time.
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.740]   And the longer I live, the more convincing proofs
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:30.740]   I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men.
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.720]   And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.020]   without his notice, is it probable that an empire
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.980]   can rise without his aid?
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.820]   We have been assured, sir, in the sacred writings
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.380]   that except the Lord build the house,
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.700]   they labor in vain that build it.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.600]   I firmly believe this.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.040]   I therefore beg leave to move,
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.060]   that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heaven
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.260]   and its blessing on our deliberations be held
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.960]   in this assembly every single morning
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.540]   before we proceed to business.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.660]   Benjamin Franklin just said, I think that we need to pray
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.620]   every morning before we write the Constitution.
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.820]   As they were meeting to write it,
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.240]   God, please bless America, bless our time together.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.700]   It doesn't seem the writings of a man
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.060]   who thinks it's a watchmaker.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.860]   Clearly, even if his faith is complicated,
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.140]   it's steeped in a perspective that comes from one place,
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.980]   the Bible.
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.620]   Sam Adams, known as the father of revolution,
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.820]   organized a tea party, said,
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.020]   "Jesus alone is the hope for salvation."
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.780]   John Adams said, "If a country just sets the Bible
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.940]   "as their law, it will become a utopia and a paradise."
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:35.780]   Over and over again.
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.460]   Even Webster, the Continental Congress in 1777,
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.620]   we're at war, what did they say?
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.420]   They say, "Hey, we gotta give all the soldiers in the army
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.820]   "two things, a gun and a Bible."
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.340]   It was very much a part of the DNA
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.460]   and the fabric of our country.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.020]   Not only was it a part of the founders,
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.020]   it was a part of the perspective of the people,
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.140]   in case you're like, yeah, I guess the founders,
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.900]   you know, the top 1%, but were the people Christian?
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.320]   Here's what we know about the Christian practice
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.160]   of the people.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.860]   Do you know the first celebrity in the United States was?
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.900]   Like, I mean, before there was like Selena Gomez
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.020]   and Justin Bieber and the Kardashians,
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.600]   who was the first celebrity in the United States?
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.620]   He had two initials, GW.
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.940]   George Whitefield.
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.940]   And you're going like, what?
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.780]   Didn't see that coming.
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.500]   Who is George Whitefield?
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.320]   George Whitefield, no, it wasn't George Washington.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.500]   He wasn't even the most famous guy with the initials GW.
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.960]   George Whitefield was a Bible teacher.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.360]   Scholars say that the most famous person
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.080]   prior to the Revolutionary War,
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.600]   right around that time, was George Whitefield.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.680]   What did he do for a living?
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.000]   He taught the Bible to people.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.440]   It is estimated by scholars that 80% of the people
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.120]   in the colonies heard George Whitefield.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.720]   Everywhere they went, they flocked.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.020]   Now, why do I tell you that?
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.120]   Not to prove like, oh man, they'd all heard him.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.460]   I'm trying to prove that the culture of the times.
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.900]   Imagine what it would take today
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.520]   for the most famous person in our land to be,
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.280]   and specifically the most famous outside of the royal family
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.760]   is what scholars believe.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.280]   So out of King George in England and the royal family,
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.520]   the most famous person was George Whitefield,
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.800]   who was a pastor, a traveling Bible teacher.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.320]   What would it take today in a culture where like,
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.640]   the Kardashians are who we look to,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.480]   or Justin Bieber, whatever it is,
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.280]   for our culture to see the most famous people would flock,
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:30.280]   they'd go anywhere to hear a traveling Bible teacher.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.520]   It was steeped in the practice of the people.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.200]   The French nation sent someone named Alexis de Tocqueville,
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.620]   who came here to study America.
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.400]   The French had had a revolution.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.960]   Basically like France was like, oh man,
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.920]   America just went through this revolution.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.880]   It looks like things are going good.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.000]   We should go study them.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.720]   1830, they send this guy over.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.200]   He gets on a boat, gets over there.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.760]   He's like, hey guys, I'm here to take some notes
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.960]   and learn about America.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.020]   Alexis looks around.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.060]   He writes a 12-volume book called Democracy in America.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.440]   And here's what he writes.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.160]   There's so many different things that he says
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.360]   about the Christian faith that was everywhere,
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.960]   but he writes this.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.800]   There is no country in the world
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:12.420]   where the Christian religion retains a greater influence
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.520]   over the souls of man than in America.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:19.240]   America is great because America is good.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.040]   If America ever ceases to be good,
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.320]   America will cease to be great.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:28.680]   All over our founding was this new way of thinking,
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.680]   this Christian moral foundation
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.400]   was at the heart of our founding.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.640]   Even so much of the way that you think today,
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.520]   that Americans think, that I think today
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.360]   is all steeped in Christian values.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.440]   Like it's so hard that we can't even believe it
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.400]   because it's the world, it's all we've ever known.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.440]   It's everywhere that we look.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.200]   We've only known a world where we think
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.280]   it's natural and normal that everyone should think,
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.020]   oh man, women have rights.
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.500]   Even me saying that is like, dude,
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.000]   did you just like suggest they may not have rights?
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.380]   You'd be like, that's ridiculous.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.220]   We think that's normal.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.280]   We think everyone should think,
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.900]   yeah, of course, men and women have rights.
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.320]   We think that the weak should not be abused by the strong.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.040]   We think men and women should be treated fairly.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.360]   We don't think that the disabled
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.800]   should be taken advantage of.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.360]   We don't think anyone should be taken advantage of.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.760]   We think everyone, regardless of their skin color,
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.640]   regardless of the amount of money they make,
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.280]   Bill Gates and a homeless guy, same value.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.640]   No better.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.320]   And we think that's normal.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.740]   You were taught that.
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.740]   That comes from a Christian perspective
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.340]   that is so steeped in our thinking,
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.700]   we don't even realize that it all comes back
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.660]   to one place, the Christian moral foundation.
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.820]   Here's how you can like look outside and see,
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.020]   huh, yeah, I guess that's not normal to everybody.
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.780]   If you look around our world, it becomes very apparent.
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.100]   They don't think like us.
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.260]   Like when you look in the Middle East,
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.780]   there's a reason why if anybody went on vacation
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.100]   this past summer, I'm guessing at the top 10 of your list
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.660]   was not like, yeah, so I spent a little time
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:58.420]   in Afghanistan and then Pakistan,
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.800]   and then just decided to stop by Syria
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.340]   to see what they had going on.
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.640]   And then I decided to, you know,
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.320]   Saudi Arabia seems beautiful.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.160]   They have the shore, Mediterranean,
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.400]   just was great, pita bread, oh, it was great.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.440]   None of us think that way.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.660]   Here's why, here's why people are not flocking over there.
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:17.920]   Because women can't drive cars in Saudi Arabia.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.880]   Because if you attempt to be, if you're a woman
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.320]   who tries to get educated, who even suggests
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.160]   that girls should be educated in Pakistan,
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.160]   you're liable to be shot and killed, and have been killed.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.160]   Even in Asia, you look around,
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.320]   there's 160 million more men than women in Asia
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.600]   because of the one-child policy of China.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.360]   And people, if they have a baby girl, they'll kill it.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.060]   Or they'll use selective abortion.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.660]   And you look around the world, it becomes very clear,
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.040]   they don't think like we think.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.860]   There's something different in they don't think
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:53.700]   like we think.
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.460]   And we think like, yeah, I know, and it's wrong.
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:56.880]   Everybody should think that way.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.900]   You were taught that.
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.780]   You were taught that everyone has value.
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.500]   You were taught that everyone is endowed by their creator.
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:04.780]   And I believe with all my heart,
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.240]   it's the truth that everyone has dignity and rights.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.200]   Because the scripture tells me that it's true.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.220]   And we stand on the firm foundation
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.180]   that they don't stand on.
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.860]   Specifically, even the countries I named
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.380]   of like, you're not going vacationing there,
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.060]   they don't have a Christian foundation.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.580]   Think about that.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.540]   They have an Islamic foundation.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:28.180]   And this isn't some effort to rally anger
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:32.060]   towards Islamic thinking or Islamophobia
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.300]   other than it is not, not all world views are created equal.
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.220]   And the Christian worldview is steeped
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.820]   in the way that you and I think.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:49.800]   Chinese sociologists also studied America more recently.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.020]   So Alex Tocqueville did in 1930s for France.
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.940]   He said, "Man, America, I think it's the faith
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:54.780]   "that they have."
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.980]   Here's what Chinese sociologists came and studied America
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.300]   and here's their conclusion.
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.260]   This comes from the chief editor for Time Magazine,
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.360]   David Aikman, who was the correspondent in Beijing
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.200]   for a number of years.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.540]   He wrote "Jesus in Beijing."
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:09.380]   It's a book.
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.740]   And in there, he talks about this lecture that he attended
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.100]   with 18 other American people that was held.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.060]   It was being a lecture.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.260]   This Chinese sociologist and a number of them
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.380]   were given this lecture on their studies
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.540]   of what they thought led to the success of America.
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.740]   You can read it in his book,
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.280]   "Jesus in Beijing," Time Magazine.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.780]   He says that the Chinese sociologist said this,
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.460]   "One of the things that we were asked to look into
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.860]   "was what accounted for the success,
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.580]   "in fact, the preeminence of the West all over the world.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:45.060]   "We studied everything we could from your historical
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.720]   "to your political, economic, and cultural perspective.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.420]   "At first, we thought it was because you had
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.720]   "more powerful guns than we had.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.040]   "Then we thought it was because you had
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.220]   "the best political system, democracy.
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:59.820]   "Next, we focused on your economic system, capitalism.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.080]   "But in the past 20 years, we have realized
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.400]   "that the heart of your culture is your religion.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.720]   "That is why the West has been so powerful.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.540]   "The Christian moral foundation of social
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.120]   "and cultural life is what made possible
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.140]   "the emergence of capitalism
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.440]   "and the successful transition to democratic politics.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.360]   "We don't have any doubt about this.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.920]   "Studies reveal that in rural areas of China,
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.060]   "where traveling evangelists," we call them missionaries,
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.440]   "introduce the Christian faith,
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.360]   "opium addiction goes down, crime drops,
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.560]   "and Christian families grow wealthier than their neighbors.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.280]   "Even other countries, despite our reluctance
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.420]   "to acknowledge it, look on and they say,
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.040]   "'Huh, I don't know why they've been so successful.'
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.680]   "Their faith, their Christian perspective
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:56.240]   "then informs and has allowed for capitalism to flourish,
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.340]   "has allowed for democracy to take place.
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:02.540]   "And it is the thing that allows
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.580]   "and will allow us to not fall.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.340]   "But we're in a time and place where it is continued
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.300]   "to be removed and removed from society,
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.340]   "and the church, more than ever before,
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.340]   "needs to stand up and continue
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:16.040]   "to not just pick it out in the streets,
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.800]   "but continue to love and move forward.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.880]   "The mission is more important than ever before,
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.040]   "as our country continues to move and spiral down."
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.900]   So the third idea from this talk tonight
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.200]   is will or why will America fall?
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.880]   Or why will she cease to be great?
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.700]   We read early in Romans one that Paul just says,
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.260]   "Hey, the wrath of God is revealed from heaven."
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.380]   And here's how the wrath of God is revealed against heaven.
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.860]   He basically says that, hey,
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.300]   they begin to suppress the truth.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.240]   Like what happens, when you wanna see God's wrath,
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.960]   this is so crazy, 'cause I think a lot of us think,
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.920]   oh man, God's wrath, I got a cold today,
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.240]   or a lightning bolt struck him,
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.400]   or man, I'm running late today,
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.680]   God, why are you angry?
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.600]   And Paul says, "The wrath of God is revealed
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.940]   "from heaven against people
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.120]   "who begin to suppress the truth
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:07.580]   "and run after vices, after sin,
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.120]   "and God will not just stop them
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.460]   "or hit 'em with a lightning bolt,
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:11.880]   "he'll let them keep going.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.160]   "He'll even let them suppress the truth that God exists."
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.080]   I mean, it's Paul's words, it's Paul's passage that is,
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.800]   we hold these truths to be self-evident.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.280]   Paul, what's self-evident?
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.680]   That God exists.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.440]   And you see it in the creation around us,
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.500]   and any person who says God does not exist
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.920]   is clearly experiencing just the wrath of God
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.880]   because he's letting them run from him.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:39.880]   But he says, any time that a person runs from God,
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.520]   they run towards destruction.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.700]   They run from the truth and towards a lie.
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:49.540]   So how will America fall?
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.660]   Paul just told us the way a person falls
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.980]   is they run from their creator.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.820]   They worship created things, maybe it's a job,
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.100]   maybe it's money, maybe it's sex,
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.980]   maybe it's a dating relationship, maybe it's whatever.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.300]   He says, any time that someone runs from that,
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:06.700]   and God in his wrath, which is a terrifying thing,
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.140]   he will allow people to run,
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:09.980]   or that's what he's saying,
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.240]   he will allow people to run,
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.700]   or that's one of the ways you see his wrath.
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.300]   And Christ, we're not talking about Christians here,
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:19.160]   as you have been placed under a totally different covenant.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.600]   But Paul says, when you run from God,
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.220]   you invite destruction into your life.
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.420]   That's how a person falls.
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.160]   So how does a democracy fall?
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.960]   A democracy is a government of the people,
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.100]   a bunch of people.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.880]   So the way you bring down an individual person
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.180]   is that person runs from God.
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:38.980]   The way you bring down a democracy
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.100]   is the people begin to run from God.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:45.180]   That's the problem, honestly, with democracy.
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.700]   Because if everybody's corrupt,
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.140]   if everybody's like, yeah, man,
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.220]   we should all cut off our hands, that would be cool.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.220]   Who wants to vote?
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:54.100]   51% cut off our hands, cool, we're all doing it together.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.920]   All of a sudden, you're like, oh, man, we are toast.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.580]   If a democracy is only as strong
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:58.580]   as the people that make it up,
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.140]   if the people are corrupt, the democracy's corrupt.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.140]   Aristotle, this Greek thinker, said democracy,
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.820]   he was a guy who wrote a bunch of different books,
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:08.660]   influenced lots of people.
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.500]   He basically said, hey, of all the governments,
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.740]   democracy's the worst one
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:16.020]   because the people are too corrupt to be able to handle it.
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.740]   America has defied that for 240 years
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:24.620]   because of a Christian foundation, which is disintegrating.
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:37.380]   One of the scholars have really put the perspective
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.060]   and beliefs of the founders
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.820]   into something they called the golden triangle of freedom,
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.180]   which is so directly related to this.
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.700]   I'm gonna try to make this engaging again,
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.260]   where a guy named Oz Guinness,
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.860]   and basically these thinkers said, hey, this is,
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.100]   let me give you a framework
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.180]   for how the founders thought about freedom.
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.260]   They said it could only work
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.660]   if these three things were a part of it.
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.000]   So in other words, if these things disappear,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.100]   you will not be able to sustain a free society.
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.060]   They said that the golden triangle of freedom,
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.860]   which I think we have a slide for, contains this.
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.220]   It says that freedom,
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:08.620]   the nature of freedom requires virtue.
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:09.620]   Like in order to be free,
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.340]   you have to have some element of virtue.
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.740]   Like in order for me to not be a heroin addict,
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:16.040]   I have to say, yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.820]   In order for me to remain free from that,
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:18.660]   I have to not do that.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:19.900]   That's an extreme example,
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:21.360]   but in order to maintain freedom,
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.500]   they said you have to have a level of virtue.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.660]   You have to voluntarily say
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:28.660]   that I'm not going to murder somebody
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:30.020]   even if I get away with it.
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:33.620]   And in order for people in society to flourish,
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.060]   freedom requires virtue.
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.420]   That virtue, by essence of what it is,
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.140]   it requires faith.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.060]   That you can't just require or say,
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.860]   hey, everybody be virtuous.
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:47.400]   I want everybody to only sleep with their spouse.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.460]   You can't just require and demand it.
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:54.420]   So virtue, the founders believed, required faith.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.740]   It required a set of beliefs.
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:59.300]   It required a person could only govern,
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.420]   we could only be a self-governing people.
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:02.700]   Like hey, we're self-governing.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.440]   We govern ourselves if we know
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.680]   how to individually govern ourselves.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.260]   And the founders believed this.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:15.260]   So they believed that Christianity or morality, religion,
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.020]   was the best encouragement that man had
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.900]   to encourage society to flourish, to encourage virtue.
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:25.140]   John Adams said this.
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:28.340]   We have no government armed with the power
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:30.860]   capable of contending with the human passions
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:31.700]   or human nature.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.740]   In other words, there is not a government strong enough
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:38.100]   to fight against human nature if it's unbridled
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:43.100]   or doesn't have bridling it, morality and religion.
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:47.580]   Our constitution was made for a moral and religious people.
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.540]   It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:55.380]   But Adams says, if we get rid of religion,
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.900]   we will not be able to hire enough police.
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:01.420]   And we will self-destruct.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.300]   That is our second president of the United States.
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:09.820]   The third thing, so freedom requires virtue.
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.360]   Virtue requires faith.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:16.700]   And faith requires freedom.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.440]   A part of the founding of a country was like,
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.160]   hey, we're gonna have freedom of religion.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.620]   Everyone is free to worship any way that they want.
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:24.460]   Here's why that's so important.
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.420]   Here's why that's so important.
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:29.620]   The founders were rebelling against a state church.
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.340]   That's why the First Amendment was written in.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.300]   Because in England, hey, you're church of England
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.520]   or you're dead, okay?
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.360]   So we're gonna have this like,
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.740]   hey, everybody gets to worship where they want.
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.540]   If you don't worship here, we're gonna kill you.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.900]   Bloody Mary and the battles with the Catholic Church
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.580]   in England, they were rebelling against that.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.220]   The Catholic Church had taken over France and Spain
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.300]   and was an integral part of that.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.580]   And so, hey, you're Catholic or you're gone.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:53.220]   And so all of this state church had really influenced
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.420]   the thinking of the founders where they said,
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.460]   everyone's gonna be free.
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:59.460]   You cannot have true religion if we enforce it by law.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.960]   Like if I'm forcing you to come to church and worship God,
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.120]   you're not actually worshiping God.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.960]   Does that make sense?
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.900]   And so the founders said, look,
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.720]   in order for faith to truly take place,
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.800]   true religion is free religion.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:17.080]   People have to choose to do it or it's not true faith.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.760]   And they said, faith requires freedom.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.760]   And if you lose any of those, you will forfeit your freedom.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:28.720]   Franklin, Ben Franklin said, the more vices a people has,
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.840]   the more they need masters and dictators
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.360]   because they can no longer govern themselves
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.520]   and they'll fight and war with one another.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:44.720]   And as we continue to eradicate faith from our society,
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.720]   we will eradicate virtue and eventually eradicate freedom.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:54.280]   And we will destroy ourselves just as Paul said,
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.620]   anytime a people runs from God,
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:01.620]   they run from the source of life, order, and peace.
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:07.020]   And it is a drift that is happening.
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.300]   I mean, it's not hard to see like, man,
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:12.740]   if you drift as a nation towards away from faith,
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.580]   like things just don't go well for you.
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.820]   You can see it all over Europe.
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.760]   You could see it, let's take a look at Amsterdam specifically.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.460]   One example, inside of Europe,
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.500]   once during its golden age,
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.940]   Amsterdam was considered the epicenter
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:26.420]   of Protestant Christianity.
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.740]   It was known for its churches.
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:29.740]   It was known for the faith
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.820]   and the people that was producing.
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:34.100]   It was known for a way of life very different than today.
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.900]   Today, it is known for, it is secular.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.420]   The church has drifted from its place or from that nation.
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.180]   And it is known for sex slavery or for prostitution
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:47.460]   for very different reasons.
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.620]   Anytime a nation drifts or runs from God,
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.260]   they invite and bring destruction on their land.
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.340]   And it is happening as a Christian faith
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:58.220]   continues to be removed and restricted.
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:02.420]   And the church, which has done a horrible job
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.240]   of standing up and not compromising,
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:09.100]   anytime the church is weakened in a nation,
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:14.540]   the nation becomes morally weak
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.240]   and moves towards destruction.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.020]   We are already seeing signs of decline in our country.
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:22.880]   It is a more divided nation than ever before.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.980]   We have $20 trillion in debt.
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.940]   The disintegration of the family
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.420]   has happened in the last 50 years.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.840]   In 1965, 5% of children were born to single mothers.
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.620]   Today, it's over 40%.
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:38.840]   Think about that.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.460]   In the African-American community,
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.660]   the black community, it's 72%.
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:48.220]   In the Hispanic community, it's 53%.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.340]   All over, I mean, in the white community,
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.980]   it's just right there with the Hispanic community.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.260]   The Asian-American community is doing honestly the best.
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:00.180]   Now we're seeing this disintegration of the family
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.020]   all over the place.
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.340]   We're seeing enormous amounts of death.
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.560]   One in three children are raised in poverty in America,
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:08.280]   according to a UNICEF study that came out a year ago.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.280]   One in three below the poverty line.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:15.100]   Is it any wonder as our nation moves from God,
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:19.300]   pornography is the most successful industry in America.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.940]   Pornography makes more money than the NBA,
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:26.220]   MLB, and the NFL combined.
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:32.560]   It is more common today to be raped than to be a smoker.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.400]   Think about that.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:38.060]   And our nation, as it continues to run from God,
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:41.980]   is gonna continue to spiral and continue to fall
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:45.000]   if it does not restore what has been removed.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.820]   And even our political leaders,
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:53.260]   I don't know what degree,
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.500]   like, you guys have been following any of that stuff,
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.560]   but are we really surprised?
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.820]   Our leaders are a reflection of the culture around us.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.180]   If some of them have said crazy things,
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.820]   which are horrendous,
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:09.980]   they're not things that are not being said in rap songs,
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.940]   in sitcoms, all over the place.
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:16.460]   Is it any surprise?
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:20.940]   And our nation will continue to spiral
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:24.520]   until the church steps up and is the church,
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.620]   'cause here's what we know.
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:27.160]   Like, our hope, and I'm about to close
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:30.540]   and land the plane right here, our hope is not in America.
[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.260]   As Christians, our hope,
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.380]   our, like, if you're a follower of Jesus in the room,
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.480]   your hope, my hope, is not in America.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.720]   But you are the hope of America,
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.280]   because you're the body of Christ.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.600]   You are the closest that anyone will ever be to Jesus.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.880]   It's you.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.280]   The democracy that is around us,
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.720]   the democratic republic, if you call it that, which it is,
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.600]   but the democracy that we're a part of
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.500]   will only be as strong as the church that makes it up.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.820]   If you're a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:55.360]   that is your responsibility and mine.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.900]   Because America's not our hope, you're the hope of America.
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:00.240]   And the question that's been asked of us,
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.060]   will we rise up and be the church more than ever before?
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:07.000]   It is crucial that our mission as followers of Jesus
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   to do whatever we have to, by whatever means possible,
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.720]   to allow people to know the God who loved them so much
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.920]   he would die for them.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:17.120]   And take the message of Christianity
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.560]   all over to every place and space in our town,
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.680]   in our city, in our state, and in our country.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.840]   'Cause you're the hope.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:27.200]   I love what one man said where he just said,
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.180]   "Look, Jesus did not come to take sides,
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.080]   "democrat, republican, he came to take over
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.680]   "and take over the hearts of people and change the world.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.740]   "And as the body of Christ,
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.140]   "you're the means he's doing that through."
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.620]   And that's our role, that's our hope,
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:42.820]   that's our application.
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:46.860]   Because if we do not restore that is not restored,
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.480]   we will continue to fall.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.820]   I'll close here.
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:53.660]   I like,
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:43:00.260]   I think in a weird way,
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:03.940]   we're like this rose as a country.
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:04.960]   And follow me.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.560]   I feel like this is like, just became The Bachelor.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.900]   (congregation laughing)
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:16.600]   If this thing, like it looks pretty,
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.860]   like it's like, oh man, it's a good looking rose.
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:20.960]   This thing is dying.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.840]   It's cut off from its roots.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.060]   Like it looks beautiful today,
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.860]   but I don't know if you've ever been around flowers.
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.500]   I'm guessing for the girls, for sure you have,
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.560]   and if guys, hopefully you have.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.360]   If this thing is not placed in water,
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.280]   it's gonna die quickly.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.400]   And here's what, no matter how much water we put in it,
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.940]   in a week, this will not look like this.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:42.280]   Like it may look somewhat pretty right now,
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.240]   but be assured, it is dying
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.080]   because it is cut off from its roots.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.600]   The church in America
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:57.800]   is the only hope of reconnecting our country to its roots.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.600]   Our nation will be like this flower will be in a week,
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.840]   and that it may look pretty right now,
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.800]   you're like, "Yeah, but look, dude,
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:04.840]   "I got the new iPhone 7.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.180]   "I mean, my life is pretty good.
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.540]   "I mean, things are going fine.
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.740]   "The economy's okay.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:09.780]   "Everything looks okay.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.380]   "Everything still looks pretty."
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:16.480]   But when things get cut off from their roots,
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.280]   their foundation, they begin to die.
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:22.680]   And so it will be for us
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:26.080]   if we do not reconnect and reestablish,
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.640]   go back to the America the founders dreamed of,
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:33.560]   the America that Jesus loves a lot more
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.400]   than you and I ever will,
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.080]   because he loves people
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.340]   and the people that made up and make up America.
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:46.680]   I don't know if you're like,
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.780]   I like have this weird, I've always loved our country.
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.080]   And I don't know, anybody like,
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.600]   anybody love America in here?
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.040]   Hopefully you do more of this message.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:00.040]   I think even from like a young age,
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.200]   I like find writings.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.320]   I was looking through in this past week
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.600]   'cause I was like trying to find an illustration
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.640]   for something and I was looking at stuff
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.120]   that was all like, man, as a six-year-old,
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:06.940]   man, I just love America.
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:07.780]   Everybody should move to America.
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:08.620]   I love America.
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:11.080]   Here's what you and I love about America.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.320]   And what will continue to be lovable about America
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.360]   or will cease to be an America worth loving
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.340]   is not the American culture.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:21.720]   It is the Christian culture.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.320]   And man, I want that with all of my heart.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.600]   And I know in this room,
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.760]   there's men and women who share that desire,
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.880]   who share the desire that, hey, all over the city,
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.760]   all over this town, all over this country,
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.680]   we're gonna take the message of Jesus Christ.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.920]   It is the Christian culture that provides freedom.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.520]   It is the Christian culture that says every person,
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.880]   man, woman, red, yellow, black, and white,
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.240]   all of them are precious in his sight.
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.540]   All of them deserve dignity.
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.860]   All of them should be treated with care, with opportunity.
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.960]   All of them have rights.
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.740]   That is the Christian message.
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.520]   And if there's any part of you,
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.480]   if you walk out of here tonight,
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.360]   you're like, man, they're just like all about America
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.200]   in this place.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.480]   I'm like more like world-focused.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.920]   We're all about Jesus.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.040]   And we're all about people knowing Jesus.
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.840]   We think that America is not our hope.
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.780]   We are the hope of America because of Christ.
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:10.080]   And if you're not a Christian,
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.980]   you're not the hope of America.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:14.840]   But there's a hope you need to know, and that's Jesus,
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.040]   your savior who loved you and died for you,
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.500]   the savior of George Washington,
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.840]   the savior of the men who founded this country,
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:27.040]   the savior of our world, of every Pakistani,
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:30.420]   every Saudi, every English person,
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.480]   everyone who's ever lived,
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:36.280]   and the only one who offers hope to a world who needs it
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:41.880]   and life, and who when we follow will lead us
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.120]   as a person and as a people to life.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:45.560]   Let me pray that be the case.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:49.840]   Father, would you heal our land?
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.160]   You tell us that if your people,
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.760]   in the Old Testament, speaking of Israel,
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.080]   now as the New Testament,
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.760]   your people, the church, will humble themselves,
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.360]   repent, will seek your face,
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.500]   then you will hear from heaven and you will heal their land.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:09.240]   God, would you heal our land?
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:13.420]   Father, we need you.
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:18.560]   Would you help us to stand firm as followers of Jesus
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:21.640]   as we look at a government that is spiraling out of control
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.400]   and realizing that we live not in a monarchy.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.640]   We don't submit to a king.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.040]   We submit to a savior and we live in a democracy.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.800]   And so we, the people, millions of Christians,
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.240]   if they act like Christians and follow Jesus,
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.240]   are more forceful, more powerful,
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.340]   have more influence than any political leader ever will.
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.840]   Would you strengthen your church, Lord?
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.920]   And would you multiply it all over this world?
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.360]   Would you bring freedom, and equality, and rights
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.720]   through the power of forgiveness
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.160]   that is found in Jesus alone in every nation,
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.700]   in every place, in every space, Lord?
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.160]   Would you come quickly?
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:04.060]   Would you bless our nation by turning our nation to you?
[00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.880]   Amen.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:12.600]   - Dude, that's the best version of God Bless America
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.960]   there's ever been.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.100]   Man, we love you guys.
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.680]   We wanna make sure you know about a few opportunities
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.360]   that are coming up and it's so perfect.
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.840]   We were talking about the blessing of God on America,
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.920]   that the worst thing God can do
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.920]   is financially bless our country if we're running from him.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.760]   So sometimes the blessing of God looks like,
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.000]   hey, I'm just gonna turn you guys back to me
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.520]   through whatever it takes,
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.440]   through a broken political system,
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:41.440]   through a less than ideal president on,
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.080]   yeah, I'll just stop there.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:46.840]   Sometimes he turns through a recession,
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.080]   through whatever it is, man.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.920]   And that's the most loving thing he can do,
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.800]   to do whatever it takes, I'm gonna turn you back.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.220]   And so we're praying that that would take place.
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:56.880]   That's why they sang that part right there.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:57.800]   We wanna make sure you guys know
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:58.880]   about a couple opportunities.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.820]   If you wanna talk about anything that you heard tonight,
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:03.400]   we'd love to talk with you, we'd love to pray with you.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.640]   If you're walking through something down front,
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.000]   we'll have volunteers that'll be here to connect with you.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.960]   We'd love to meet and love to speak with you.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.240]   If you're not in a community group,
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.380]   tonight is an opportunity for you
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:12.920]   to get to connect with other men and women.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.760]   We think that no one should have to walk through life alone.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.740]   And so if you don't have a small group of people
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.680]   that come around you and encourage you
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.520]   in your walk with Jesus,
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.560]   my guess is that walk is lonely
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:27.120]   and a lot more difficult than God wants it to be.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.640]   And so tonight you have a chance to get plugged in.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:29.960]   If you're a guy, you can go right down
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.160]   this little hallway right here.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.440]   There'll be a room right at the end of it.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.440]   You can meet and connect in a small group with other guys.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.440]   If you're a girl,
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.380]   you can go right down the edge of this hallway.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.640]   If you are new here and you're looking for information
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.280]   about, man, what are all the opportunities
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.480]   that exist at Watermark to get connected,
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.160]   to find out kind of like what we believe
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.840]   or what is our vision, values,
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:49.200]   what opportunities to serve in the city,
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.040]   all those things.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.460]   We have something called Next Steps,
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.400]   which is just essentially, if it's your first time,
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.240]   we wanna make sure you know everything that's available
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.880]   to answer any questions you may have.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.320]   That'll be in the chapel,
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.560]   which is right outside of these doors.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.720]   If you go up these stairs right here,
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:03.680]   you'll see the chapel.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.760]   And in college, we'll be in stage two,
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.960]   partying tonight.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:07.900]   You don't wanna miss it.
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:08.740]   We love you guys.
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:10.440]   You guys have a great week of worship.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.680]   (cheering)
