[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (rock music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:23.340]   - Tribute to Jimi Hendrix or something.
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.180]   How we doing?
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.020]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.340]   Come on.
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.060]   Welcome to the porch.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.500]   So glad you're here, Fort Worth, Houston, around the world.
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.780]   We're glad you're tuned in with us this evening.
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.580]   My name is JP and I have the privilege
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.380]   of diving into God's word with you.
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.980]   And recently, so like last week,
[00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.700]   this friend of mine gave me a Nest.
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.740]   You guys know what these are?
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.500]   Like the smart thermostat.
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.220]   Anybody have one?
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.000]   Dude, they're amazing.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.700]   They're so cool 'cause they save you money
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.340]   and they like know when you're home and when you're not
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.300]   and it like adjusts the temperature,
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.980]   the climate of your house and it's pretty incredible.
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.300]   So there's a shout out for Nest.
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.940]   But so he gives me one and he's like,
[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.060]   hey, we can install it in your house.
[00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.420]   It will take about 15 minutes.
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.580]   And so I called him, you know,
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.220]   I guess it was like last Thursday and he comes over
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.420]   and so it took me about 15 minutes
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.340]   to find the screwdriver, okay?
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.860]   And so then like another 15 minutes
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.300]   to remove the first screw.
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.380]   And then about 45 minutes later,
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.140]   like I had unplugged these five wires to my old thermostat
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.740]   and had hooked up the five wire,
[00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.980]   which is just dangerous, let's agree,
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.740]   but I had hooked up the five wires to the new thermostat
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.860]   and I'm excited and we like,
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.860]   you program it to your internet,
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.860]   like you have to put in your WiFi password
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.860]   and all that, it's amazing.
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.460]   And then I'm getting this error message.
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.500]   Like it's not working.
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.340]   And he had said early on, hey, we should flip the breaker.
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.180]   Like we should turn off,
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.640]   You're supposed to turn off the breaker before you do this.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.300]   But I had already touched the wires
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.140]   and they didn't shock me,
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.460]   so I'm like, low voltage wires, it'll be fine.
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.420]   And as we're hooking it up,
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.140]   and we like Google the error message
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.540]   and we can't figure out what's going on,
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.180]   and so we call customer service.
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.820]   It's about, let's see, so it's about 10 p.m. at this point.
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.300]   We're on the phone with customer service.
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.100]   They're like, okay, let's troubleshoot this,
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.020]   which has me running back and forth to the breaker box.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.180]   Flip the breaker, flip it on, flip it off, flip it on.
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.500]   Move this wire, plug it here, plug it here, plug it here.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.740]   And I'm just trying to figure out
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.440]   why this thing's not working.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.440]   And lo and behold, so about 11.15 p.m.,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.020]   I'm on the phone with customer service.
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.900]   We've escalated to tier two.
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.500]   And I've got to get up at 5.45 a.m. the next morning.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.700]   So I'm like, okay, buddy, I need you to level with me.
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.780]   Like, how much longer will this take?
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.180]   Like, 'cause man, I've got to go to bed.
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.580]   And how sure are you that you're actually
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.660]   gonna be able to fix this problem?
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.260]   And he's like, man, it's gonna take me
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.020]   about 20 more minutes of troubleshooting.
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.380]   And then I'll just be able to tell you
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.220]   what's wrong with it.
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.580]   I don't know that we'll actually be able to fix it.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.700]   And I'm like, okay, peace out.
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.700]   So basically, I undo that one.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.660]   And I unplug the five wires.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.660]   I get my old thermostat.
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.220]   I'm like, hey, we have to go back to where we started.
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.980]   And we'll pick this up some other day.
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.860]   But I've got to go to sleep, got to catch some Zs.
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.500]   And so put the old one back up.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.900]   And it doesn't work.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.820]   You know, an irony of ironies,
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.780]   there's another family staying with us this night
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.780]   because their AC was out.
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.380]   How hysterical, how hilarious is that?
[00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.380]   And so they're staying with us
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.540]   because their AC didn't work.
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.700]   And now, and this is like after Monica said,
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.100]   why do you have to do this so late?
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.940]   And I wouldn't do this.
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.540]   And so like, she's like biting her tongue
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.180]   from the big, I told you so.
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.460]   And now the old thermostat doesn't work either.
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.140]   Turns out what had happened was,
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.820]   because I didn't flip the breakers early on,
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.820]   I actually shorted out my main AC unit, okay?
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.380]   I destroyed the very thing I was trying to make better.
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.340]   And as you think about why, it's because, two reasons.
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.020]   One, because I had missed some key instruction early on.
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.780]   I overlooked out of convenience
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.980]   some very important instruction early on.
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.500]   And not only that, but I misunderstood the consequences.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.100]   I thought, oh, you want me to flip the breaker
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.100]   so I don't get shocked.
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.340]   No, I want you to flip the breaker
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.940]   so you don't have to spend hundreds of dollars
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.380]   repairing your AC.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.580]   Oh, so I just misunderstood the consequences.
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.820]   And we ended up in a hot mess.
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.660]   And as, thank you.
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.900]   And as I think about that,
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.220]   and as I think about that, and I look at our country,
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.260]   I'm asking this about our country.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.460]   How did we end up in this hot mess?
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.460]   How did we get here?
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.900]   This is crazy.
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.020]   The most controversial election of all time.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.460]   We're moving toward the date where we vote.
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.100]   Most of us are discouraged, scratching our head,
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.380]   not knowing what to do.
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.020]   Some of us are very opinionated.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.740]   We think we have the right answer.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.980]   And we figured it out.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.220]   And so we're very vocal and we're just kind of discouraged.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.740]   How did we get in this hot mess?
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.740]   And I think it's because we missed some key instructions.
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.820]   And we've misunderstood the consequences,
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.060]   specifically this generation, our generation,
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.060]   your and my generation.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.980]   Call us millennials if you please.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.140]   But I think we've made some mistakes.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.700]   See, last year, marriage, an institution invented by God,
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.580]   was redefined for the first time since creation.
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.140]   We almost lost our religious liberty.
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.900]   Our right to bear arms came under fire.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.740]   A mother's right to end the life of her child in the womb
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.980]   is the holocaust of our day.
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.660]   And our options for presidents are less than desirable.
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.660]   We have a narcissistic reality TV star billionaire
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.540]   and the wife of an adulterous man
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.380]   considered by some to be a criminal.
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.540]   And the biggest concern among millennials
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.780]   is global warming.
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.540]   I'm serious.
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.300]   And I'm not saying global warming's not important.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.300]   Like we should certainly preserve this earth.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.800]   God has called us to.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.640]   But how did we get into this hot mess?
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.580]   And I want to kind of tell you,
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.140]   I want to lead with what I think it is.
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.300]   It's very interesting.
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.540]   I hope you'll hang in there with me.
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.180]   I think it has to do with one of the greatest desires
[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.140]   in the room this evening.
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.060]   Sex.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:53.060]   I think that a huge part of our government's problem
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.500]   actually has to do with sex, how we want it,
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.660]   whenever we want it, wherever we want it,
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.300]   however we want it, without consequences.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.620]   And when I say we, I mean us.
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.820]   Like you and me, those of us here,
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.620]   our generation, this demographic.
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.940]   And so this evening we're talking about
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.700]   how sex has impacted government
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.100]   and why it should matter to us.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.620]   And I know that our desire is to express love physically
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.140]   with whomever we want.
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.360]   And we want to avoid the consequences.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.980]   And I think it's caused some of our political issues,
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.760]   especially on the topic of the redefinition of marriage
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.740]   that occurred on our watch on April 28th, 2015,
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.220]   and the topic of abortion.
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.780]   That honestly I'm encouraged
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.740]   because I think we millennials
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.700]   are actually taking ground on it.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.580]   So listen, let me give this disclaimer up front.
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.940]   Stay with me, hang in there.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.380]   You think you know what I'm gonna say, okay?
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:57.060]   I understand generally who I am speaking to.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.700]   I have given my entire adult life
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.140]   to ministering to and through millennials
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.540]   at a cost to me for the love of you.
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.820]   And the reason I have done so is for three reasons.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.020]   Number one, because I trusted Christ
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.500]   as a young adult in my 20s.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.380]   I came into a relationship with Jesus Christ
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.820]   and it changed everything about my life.
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.660]   Number two, second reason,
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.140]   because I think you are the single most powerful demographic
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.260]   on the face of the planet.
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.460]   If anyone is going to change the world or save the world,
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.900]   it is going to be God working through you.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:39.260]   And number three, because the majority of your peers
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.700]   are following their feelings
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.060]   and doing what they think is wise in their own eyes
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.980]   and they're leaving the church
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.460]   and abandoning a biblical worldview in droves
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.100]   and I believe it will hurt them
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.420]   and I believe it will hurt you and I love you
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.100]   and I don't want you to hurt, so I need you to listen.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.820]   Please, I'm asking you this courtesy, this favor.
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:09.460]   Please listen to me for the next 35 minutes.
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.180]   Give me 35 minutes of your life.
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.900]   Some of you will disagree with me,
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.340]   some of you will hate me,
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.680]   some of you will be very, very angry.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:23.280]   Please give me 35 minutes, hang in with me 'til the end
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.060]   and you can strengthen your argument against me
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.620]   if you'd like.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.580]   If you agree with what I'm saying,
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.620]   you can strengthen your argument with what I'm saying.
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.140]   You may agree with half and disagree with the other half.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.340]   I don't know where you're at,
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.180]   but I wanna talk to those of you in the room
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.660]   that just don't care
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:47.780]   because I don't think you can be a follower of Jesus Christ
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.700]   and not care about these issues.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.300]   And so you're the ones I'm most
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:01.380]   desiring to speak to tonight and if you disagree,
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.780]   I just ask you the courtesy to write down the things
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.740]   that you disagree with and then let's engage
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.560]   in a discussion.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.060]   I'd love the opportunity to learn from you.
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.340]   I'll stay as late as I need to.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.780]   I'll schedule other meetings, I'll take phone calls,
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.960]   I'll read emails.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.480]   I would love the opportunity to learn from you.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.660]   Thank you.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:27.720]   And so tonight we're gonna talk about two things done,
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.140]   two things we've done wrong
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.180]   and what I believe is the solution.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.260]   Specifically how we've overlooked instruction,
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.080]   how we've misunderstood the consequences
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.660]   and what we need to do now.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.860]   Abraham Lincoln said, "We are a government of the people,
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.700]   "for the people, by the people."
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.260]   Here's what that means.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:52.200]   The government should do whatever is in the best interest
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.620]   of the people.
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.300]   And we may disagree what that is,
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.500]   but I thank you ahead of time for listening.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.660]   And so the first point this evening is we've overlooked
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.420]   God's clear instruction.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.780]   We've overlooked God's clear instruction.
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.900]   Do you remember when I shorted out that AC?
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.500]   It's because I missed this one simple instruction
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.520]   that I was to flip off the breaker
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.020]   and I thought it wasn't an important instruction
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.500]   and it led to grave consequences.
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.000]   And so what we've done as a generation is we fed
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.860]   our preferences over God's truth.
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.420]   We followed our heart and sought out our own desires
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.560]   and we've considered his truth an inconvenience,
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.800]   like taking time to flip a breaker.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.600]   James chapter one, verse 21 says,
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.220]   "Therefore get rid of all moral filth and the evil
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.720]   "that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word of God
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.560]   "planted in you, which can save you.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.320]   "Do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourself.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.080]   "Do what it says."
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.280]   Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.840]   is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.120]   and after looking at himself goes away
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.900]   and immediately forgets what he looks like.
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.060]   Here's what James means.
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.200]   Jesus' brother's writing this and he's saying,
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.760]   hey, if you read the word of God
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.960]   and you don't make a change,
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.360]   it's like you looking in the mirror,
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.180]   seeing your hair all disheveled,
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.600]   seeing something on your face
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.080]   and walking away without making a change.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.720]   The word of God is meant to change you,
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   to conform you to the image and the character
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.020]   of his son Jesus Christ.
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.280]   But whoever looks intently into the perfect law
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.640]   that gives freedom and continues in it,
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.600]   not forgetting what they have heard but doing it,
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.240]   they will be blessed in what they do.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.200]   And so primarily when our generation,
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.080]   yours and my generation is trying to figure out
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.520]   what is right, we don't follow James' instructions.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.320]   We don't turn to God's word.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.240]   We don't open the scriptures and say,
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.800]   God, what would you have for me?
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.120]   We follow our feelings and our opinions.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:51.840]   Even when this issue of redefining marriage came up,
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.120]   we said this is about love.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.880]   I wanna make a case that it's actually about sex.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.720]   See, God doesn't have an issue with who you love.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.960]   But any sexual act, listen closely,
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.360]   is condemned in the scriptures when it is not
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.000]   between a married husband and wife.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.960]   I'll give you some scriptures.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.680]   Leviticus 18, verse 22 says,
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.480]   do not have sexual relations with a man
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.960]   as one does with a woman.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.960]   That is detestable.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.440]   And you could argue that this is abolished with the law
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.560]   and this is the Old Testament law,
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.120]   but it's brought back up in the New Testament.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.560]   First Corinthians chapter six, verse nine,
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.320]   or do you not know that wrongdoers
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.640]   will not inherit the kingdom of God,
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.640]   do not be deceived neither sexual and moral,
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.960]   nor idolaters, nor adulterers,
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.080]   nor men who have sex with men.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.280]   You may say that word means something else.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.200]   There is no theological credible scholarship
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.080]   that would support you in that view.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.480]   That word can only mean,
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.040]   it's two words actually in the Greek,
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.160]   that can only mean men having sex with men.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.720]   It's consensual, it's not rape.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.960]   This was written to a homoerotic class
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.160]   or homoerotic culture much more than ours.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.840]   The president of the time, the emperor, had two gay lovers.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.760]   First Timothy chapter one, verse 10 says,
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.760]   we also know that the law is made not for the righteous,
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.280]   but for the lawbreakers and rebels,
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.000]   the ungodly and the sinful, the unholy and irreligious.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.680]   For those who kill their fathers or mothers or murderers,
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.200]   for the sexually immoral,
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.400]   for those practicing homosexuality.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.920]   And then Romans one, I'll get to in a minute,
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.440]   but I want you to know something.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.160]   All these refer to the pursuit of the sexual act,
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.480]   not to the feelings.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:32.360]   It is not sin to be attracted to someone of the same sex.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:37.360]   I'm not gonna argue if you were born that way or not.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.480]   Okay?
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.400]   People are born all kinds of ways.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:46.000]   They're all, since Genesis chapter three,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.440]   people are born with all kinds of ways.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.120]   I have all sorts of desires within me
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.280]   that are not best for me.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.640]   But it's when you take that desire
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.040]   and you do something with it
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.280]   that clearly goes against what the scripture says,
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.680]   you have to ask, what are we doing?
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.400]   So on our watch, we've allowed the government
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.160]   to redefine an institution created by God, marriage,
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.600]   to allow for a sinful act that he clearly condemns.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.000]   And so why talk about this?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.080]   Listen, why not talk about pornography tonight
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.280]   or heterosexual sin or materialism?
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.320]   Can we agree on something?
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.000]   Maybe it's your first time at the porch.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.200]   Can we agree that we talk about those issues
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.000]   100 times to one?
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.520]   Can we agree that every other night you come in here
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.920]   and I'm talking about materialism or pornography
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.160]   or fornication or some other issue,
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.840]   but tonight we're talking about these two issues.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.440]   And those issues have not been before the government
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.680]   like this one has.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.840]   Or this other abomination that is happening on our watch,
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.000]   mostly among your peers and my peers
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.520]   is the issue of abortion.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:06.000]   This is dealing with the perceived consequence of sex.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.200]   Friends, I'm so grieved
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.840]   by the research that was done on this topic this week.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.520]   My heart is completely broken.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.800]   There are over one million abortions a year
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.880]   in the United States of America today.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:27.680]   Yes, today over 2,500 babies were killed
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.280]   at the will of their mother today.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.120]   And if you've made this decision,
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.280]   I know right now you are so uncomfortable.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.960]   Can I just tell you something?
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.400]   I know it's a fourth of the women here
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.600]   and so many of you men have supported this
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.440]   and been a part of it.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.280]   Can I tell you something?
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.840]   I love you, God loves you.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.320]   He's not mad at you.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.320]   He sent his son to die for this.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.920]   Okay, he has a plan for you.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.840]   He has a plan for your children.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.160]   He has a plan for this story.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.520]   He has a plan for your testimony
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.240]   that involved that action in the same way
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.080]   that I talk about pornography
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.240]   and set those engaged in pornography free.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.520]   God working through me,
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.560]   you can set those free by telling your story
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.840]   no matter how uncomfortable it is.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.640]   And God will use it in tremendous and incredible ways.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.280]   But you've gotta stay with me tonight.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.320]   Do not just get so focused.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.080]   Don't get in your head.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.240]   Stay with me word for word as I progress.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.920]   Don't just get stuck in your head
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.480]   and begin to think about the past.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.000]   Look forward, let's look forward together.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   A friend of mine who owned two abortion clinics
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.100]   and profited from the death of 40,000 babies
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.520]   before becoming a Christian was asked,
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.340]   "How do you sleep at night?"
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.580]   And she said, "Well,
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:58.060]   "Jesus either died for all of them or none of them,
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:02.020]   "and I choose to believe that he died for all of them."
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.860]   In reality, the Scripture teaches that he did.
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:10.220]   And so because we are talking about God's word,
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.180]   I need to show you where it says this is wrong.
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.180]   Essentially anywhere the Bible condemns
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.260]   killing another human.
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.620]   Certainly life begins at conception.
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.500]   That's been debated.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.660]   Psalm 139, the author of life said
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.260]   that he formed you in your mother's womb.
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.500]   When John the Baptist, that's Psalm 139.
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.020]   When John the Baptist heard the news of Jesus Christ
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.100]   in the womb of Elizabeth, he leapt, leaped.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.300]   That's Luke chapter one, verse 41.
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.020]   But then there's this, Exodus 21.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.340]   I'll read it quickly.
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.180]   Verse 22, "If people are fighting
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.540]   "and hit a pregnant woman,"
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.660]   interesting that here this part of the law
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.980]   talks about a pregnant woman,
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.540]   "and she gives birth prematurely,
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.880]   "but there is no serious injury,
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.460]   "the offender must be fined
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.300]   "whatever the woman's husband demands
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.500]   "and the court allows.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.560]   "But if there is serious injury,
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.980]   "you are to take life for life, eye for eye,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.380]   "tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.280]   "burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise."
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.700]   God is saying here if you hurt the baby's arm
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.780]   that he cares and asks for justice.
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:15.820]   And the unborn among us, friends, are the least of these.
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.460]   They cannot defend themselves.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.460]   They cannot speak up for themselves.
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.540]   They cannot address injustices against them.
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.140]   They cannot march, they cannot cry,
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.700]   they cannot do these things.
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.660]   And Jesus says in Matthew 25, verse 45,
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.480]   "Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.280]   "for one of the least of these, you did not do for me."
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.580]   Kathy Ireland, a now pro-life advocate,
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.860]   was interviewed by someone and just said,
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.940]   "Are we sure it's a life in there?
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.780]   "I just don't know that we can be sure
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.540]   "that's a human in there."
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.080]   And she responded, "Let me ask you a question.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.820]   "If you are going to tear down a building
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.480]   "and before you hit the button releasing the explosives,
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.940]   "or before you swung the wrecking ball,
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.580]   "someone said, 'I think there might be a life in there,'
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.460]   "would you move forward?
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.020]   "Or would you search that building top to bottom,
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.780]   "making sure there was not a life in there?"
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.700]   It is a scientific fact that every abortion
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.740]   performed in the US is performed on a being
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.300]   so fully formed that its heart is beating
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.580]   and its brain activity can be measured on a EEG machine.
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.860]   We must stop defending this heinous crime against God
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.940]   and do everything within our power to put an end
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.580]   to this Holocaust in our midst.
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:39.540]   And if you've had an abortion, and I know many of you have,
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.180]   you know firsthand how it impacts more than the baby,
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.220]   and your story is powerful.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.200]   Please tell it.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:51.460]   I think one of the reasons that we would engage
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.980]   in these activities against the word of God
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.460]   and the will of God is because we've misunderstood
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.060]   the consequences.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.540]   That's my second point this evening,
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.780]   is that we have misunderstood the consequences.
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:08.460]   See, when I didn't get shocked by installing that thermostat
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.540]   I thought that I had avoided the consequences.
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.260]   In reality, the consequences came much later
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:17.140]   and they were costlier and they were more uncomfortable
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.880]   than I could have imagined.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.440]   And so friends, we are sitting in the consequences
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.700]   of the pursuit of sexual freedom
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.220]   and our efforts to avoid the consequences.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:31.420]   Our sexual freedom has cost us actual freedom.
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.300]   We have celebrated the consequences.
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.940]   Let me read to you from Romans one.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.660]   David started it two weeks ago.
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.700]   He ended here in verse 25.
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.540]   I'll recap verse 24 and 25.
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.060]   "Therefore God gave them over,"
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.160]   talking about his judgment, his wrath on a nation,
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.980]   "gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.860]   "to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:53.820]   "with one another."
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.480]   They exchanged the truth about God for a lie.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.500]   They exchanged the truth about God for a lie.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.820]   Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.300]   Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.000]   for unnatural ones.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.660]   In the same way, the men also abandoned
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.380]   natural relationships with women,
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.860]   natural relations with women,
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.220]   and were inflamed with lust for one another.
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.220]   Men committed shameful acts with other men
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.580]   and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.320]   "Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.620]   "to retain the knowledge of God,
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.460]   "so God gave them over to a depraved mind
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.940]   "so that they do what ought not to be done.
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.660]   "They have become filled with every kind of wickedness,
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.380]   "evil, greed, and depravity.
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.980]   "They are full of envy and murder and strife
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.160]   "and deceit and malice.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.500]   "Their gossips, slanders, God-haters,
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.520]   "insolent, arrogant, and boastful.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.100]   "They invent ways of doing evil.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.480]   "They disobey their parents.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.820]   "They have no understanding, no fidelity,
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.780]   "no love, no mercy.
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.860]   "Although they know God's righteous decrees
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.260]   "that those who do such things deserve death."
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.260]   Listen, listen.
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.400]   "They not only continue to do these very things,
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.680]   "but also approve of those who practice them."
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.020]   They approve of those who practice them.
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.620]   This is an indictment on our generation.
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.660]   This is an indictment on millennials.
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:25.460]   Why would God care about something like homosexuality?
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:29.660]   Because he is a loving God who loves people
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.540]   and he loves relationships.
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.740]   And so let me make this point, if I may,
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:36.660]   over the next few minutes.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:41.660]   Those who identify as homosexual are 150% more likely
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.620]   to deal with depression, anxiety, and alcohol
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:45.620]   and substance abuse.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.660]   That comes from the American Public Health Association.
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:52.180]   The homosexual lifestyle includes a 200% higher rate
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.020]   of suicide.
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.500]   That comes from the American Public Health Association.
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.500]   And so some would say, "Well, this is because the church."
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.340]   Have you heard that?
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.780]   "This is because the church."
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.020]   It is just absolutely not true
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.980]   because in Sweden where there is no church,
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.180]   because in Sweden, the most secularized country
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:12.620]   on the planet, okay, it's 300% suicide.
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.780]   Homosexuality is celebrated in Sweden, okay?
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.900]   Couples can get married there and live completely
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.940]   unpersecuted by the church at all.
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.860]   And the suicide rate has increased.
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.340]   The same in the Netherlands, which has seen higher rates
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.460]   of depression, bipolar, panic disorder, OCD,
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.980]   and psychiatric disorders.
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:32.820]   The 2005 Oxford Journal of Epidemiology found
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:37.820]   that 78% have at least one STD.
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:42.140]   The US CDC said that while only 3%
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.180]   of the American population identifies with homosexuality,
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.700]   this group is responsible for 50% cases of syphilis,
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:53.460]   60% cases of gonorrhea, 90% of gay men report
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.900]   chronic or recurrent viral infection.
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.580]   Over 75% of all HIV cases in the last five years
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.420]   are among the homosexual community.
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:04.380]   Until 1982, AIDS was called GRID,
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.980]   Gay-Related Immune Deficiency Syndrome.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.060]   And why is this?
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.540]   Because a man was not designed,
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.160]   and I'm using that word designed,
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.820]   to have sex with another man.
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.940]   Likewise, with women.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.860]   It goes against the creator's desire,
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.020]   and it is not a political situation,
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.700]   it's a spiritual situation.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.940]   You invite in the wrath of God
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.880]   on an individual in a country, a nation.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.900]   You have to hear me out, you have to listen to this.
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.360]   It's always harmful to go against God's intended purpose.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.740]   In 2005, Oxford Journal of Epidemiology,
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.640]   the American Obituary Report said
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.660]   that a practicing homosexual person's life expectancy
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:00.420]   is 20 years shorter than their heterosexual counterpart.
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.720]   20 years shorter, two decades.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.360]   Only 1% of homosexual men die from old age.
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:12.500]   And some of this is because the promiscuity
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:16.260]   around the LGBTQ community.
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.340]   In a study in the Journal of Sex Research surveyed
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.300]   2,583 couples, not a single couple,
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.960]   not one of the 2,583 sustained a monogamous relationship
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.340]   despite being openly married.
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:29.820]   The average numbers of partners was between 101 and 500.
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.300]   Male couples who identify as gay
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.020]   are 50% more likely to divorce.
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.380]   Couples who identify as lesbians,
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.740]   167% more likely to divorce.
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.540]   And so here's what you're saying,
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:40.840]   'cause some of you, you're angry right now.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.980]   Listen, you would say
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.660]   that they should be able to do what they want,
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.440]   the government shouldn't speak into these such things.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.460]   As someone engages in homosexual activity,
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.740]   they are more likely to be anxious,
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:54.780]   more likely to be depressed,
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.260]   more likely to commit suicide, get sick more often,
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.460]   more likely to be promiscuous and divorced,
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.540]   and cut 20 years off their life.
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.400]   And you would say, "In love, I love them."
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.780]   And I would say, "I love them more than you do."
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.520]   I've sat with them, I've prayed with them,
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.720]   I've wept with them, I've talked with them.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.580]   I've read Scripture with them, I've counseled them,
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.560]   I've listened.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:25.940]   I've been patient, I've heard rebuttals,
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.480]   I've looked at the facts,
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.860]   and I've pleaded the one thing that I can't do is say,
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.860]   "God would say it's okay, keep doing that.
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.700]   "God loves you and you're hurting yourself."
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.660]   And you say, "But I love them,
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.100]   "they should have the freedom."
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.420]   I love them more.
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:45.120]   That's what I am trying to show you.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.180]   God loves them even more than you do.
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:53.200]   I don't want them to die 10, two decades earlier.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.100]   Some say it's hate speech, it's not,
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.860]   it's the opposite of hate speech.
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.940]   The truth sounds like hate to those who hate the truth,
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.060]   a friend of mine said.
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:07.060]   And if you make same-sex marriage a civil rights issue,
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:10.100]   you cannot stop at just same-sex.
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.460]   As I said earlier, people are sexually attracted
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.040]   to multiple adults, people are sexually attracted
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.660]   to children, people are sexually attracted
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:20.660]   to all sorts of things, and so where did their rights end?
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.460]   Ben Carson, black man, said it well, when he said,
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.940]   "Do not regard your sin as my skin."
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.540]   But why do I care what the government does?
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.720]   It's not a theocracy.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.120]   Why should the government speak into this?
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.900]   You have to understand the role of the government.
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:45.860]   It's to reward behaviors that make for a better land.
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.360]   This is why the government rewards a man and a woman
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.620]   staying together in the home.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.280]   The longer they stay together in the home,
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.780]   the more the government rewards them
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:54.960]   with tax benefits and such.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.800]   Why?
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.020]   Because it is a proven fact that
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.220]   when there's a mom and a dad in the home,
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.100]   their kids are less likely to go to prison,
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.620]   they're less likely to be on government financial assistance
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.380]   and so it actually helps the government.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.260]   The government is doing what is in their best interest.
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:14.160]   They actually save money by rewarding this behavior.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.380]   It's like if we said, well, we love ice cream,
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.420]   we all love ice cream, so the government
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.700]   should give us free ice cream,
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.580]   and the government comes and says, okay, you're right.
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.220]   Because you all love ice cream,
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.840]   you can have all the ice cream you want.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.340]   It's free, it's on us.
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.940]   All that does is cost the government
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.740]   and it costs you obesity rates would skyrocket,
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.920]   people would begin to die earlier,
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.460]   and it would not be good for the land.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.180]   And I'm not trying to be silly.
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.460]   I'm trying to show you the government's role
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:44.060]   and why it matters on this issue, on these issues.
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.620]   Friends, emotions have beat out logic on this one.
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.200]   Emotions.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.580]   As millennials have raised up,
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:55.660]   we think we know better than thousands and thousands
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.140]   and thousands of years.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:02.220]   Abortion is obviously also not best for the land.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.900]   For those who have an abortion,
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.020]   the suicide rate associated with an abortion
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:13.020]   is six times higher among the women who choose to abort
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.460]   versus the moms that have the child.
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:18.440]   Six times higher suicide rate.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:22.160]   They have an increased risk of preterm birth,
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.820]   lower fertility rate for women who have had an abortion,
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.120]   a higher fatality rate for infants,
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.020]   born to mothers who have had abortion,
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.260]   and for the child, abortions are not safe.
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.400]   Someone always dies.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:39.640]   And I know that if you had one,
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.960]   you're probably not gonna be able to hear
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.100]   anything else I said.
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.380]   'Cause you're gonna be focused on your consequences.
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.700]   I want to remind you that God loves you,
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.980]   he has a plan for you and he has a plan for your children,
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.860]   and his grace is enough.
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.940]   Please stay in there with me.
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.440]   Less than you say, well, what about rape?
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.940]   Less than 1% of abortions are the decision of a woman
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:58.860]   who has been raped.
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.440]   Less than you say, what about the mother's life or health?
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.760]   Less than 1% of abortions are to save the mother's life.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:10.260]   More than 50% of all abortions are repeat offenders,
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.620]   and the vast majority of abortions are due to inconvenience,
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.380]   well over 90% of abortions.
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.060]   The number one reason is because a baby
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.460]   would impact my school or my work.
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.900]   See, we want sex without consequences.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:29.400]   And so some of you, you're here and you think about,
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.520]   some of you might be thinking,
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.120]   well, what about racial reconciliation?
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.120]   Why didn't that make your list?
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.760]   Why aren't we talking about that?
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.080]   I'd love to remind you that we did,
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.840]   we spent an entire night on that one issue alone
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.600]   just a few weeks ago, and it is an issue,
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.480]   make no mistake about it.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.320]   And I do believe that black lives,
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.640]   absolutely, they do matter,
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.060]   and that's why I'm talking about this,
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.820]   because I wanna show you something.
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:02.100]   Did you know that over 15 million African Americans
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:05.580]   have died by abortion, which is 43 times more
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.840]   than violent crimes since 1973?
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.940]   You see violent crimes, that's the second bar,
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:14.940]   abortion, that's the last one, 15.5 million.
[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.480]   If you believe that black lives matter like I do,
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.580]   you better believe this issue matters,
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.200]   because let me tell you something,
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.520]   the most dangerous place in America
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.660]   for an African American is inside their mother's womb.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:31.500]   And that's the truth, it's statistically a fact.
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:36.000]   And because I believe your lives matter,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.820]   I'm begging you to understand that this matters.
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.860]   That was first said by a black pastor, by the way.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.560]   And my point is this, government unions
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.020]   between same-sex couples do not make for a better land.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.140]   Moms having a choice to end the life of their babies
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.780]   do not make for a better land.
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.740]   And so I know that if you're here
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.500]   and you participated in these things,
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.500]   it feels so unloving to address it in this way.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.300]   And I want you to know it's uncomfortable for me too.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.020]   I stand up here, I'm scared.
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.460]   And sometimes when I'm weak in my flesh,
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.620]   I'm like, what, they're gonna hate me.
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:12.860]   Most of 'em will disagree with me.
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:19.980]   I want you to know, I think it's kept us quiet too long.
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.900]   Being afraid to offend others.
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:27.580]   The Proverbs say, "Faithful are the wounds of a friend."
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.540]   We've gotta be able to talk about this.
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.680]   We've gotta be able to address this issue.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:38.340]   If you're here and you're attracted to the same sex,
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.220]   I'm not trying to change your attraction, man, I'm not.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:44.520]   We do not do reparative therapy here.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.840]   We do not practice it.
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.040]   I'm trying to change what you do with your attraction.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:54.360]   What does Jesus mean when he calls you to die to yourself?
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.760]   Why does he say in Matthew chapter 19
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.500]   that you have an incredible gift to be used for the kingdom?
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.380]   I believe that you do.
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.660]   You are more than your sexual orientation.
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:08.540]   In fact, it's dehumanizing that you want to be identified
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.120]   by your sexual orientation.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:15.060]   And so with both of these issues,
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:18.900]   you're gonna hear this, what people should be able to do,
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.020]   whatever they want to do with their body.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:24.940]   God disagrees.
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:29.720]   In 1 Corinthians 6, 19 and 20, he says,
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:32.580]   friends, do you not know that your body is the temple
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.580]   of the Holy Spirit who is in you,
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.300]   who have you received from God?
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.900]   He says, "You are not your own, you were bought at a price."
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.660]   See, God knows what it's like to lose a child.
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:45.980]   He lost his son on a cross for you, for me, for our sin.
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:49.820]   Do you not know that your body was purchased
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.740]   by the blood of Jesus Christ?
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.620]   You are not your own, you were bought at a price.
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:58.620]   Therefore, honor God with your body because it's his temple.
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:03.360]   This past week, our house was vandalized.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.780]   Specifically, someone had spray painted graffiti
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:08.620]   on our home.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:16.200]   As you hear that, you may think,
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.720]   I have the right to be upset about that.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.400]   Why?
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.380]   Because it's my house.
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:28.120]   When my children were inside, the place where we live,
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.060]   it's our home.
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.720]   And someone came onto our property
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.080]   and they destroyed a part of our property.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:41.040]   And it's okay.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.120]   Got a great sermon illustration out of it.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:49.160]   But God is saying, your body is his temple.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:53.840]   Do not vandalize his temple.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.280]   It belongs to him.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:00.100]   It was purchased by him.
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:05.860]   I know that some of us wanna give people
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:07.720]   the freedom to hurt themselves.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.680]   I'm telling you, I don't think that's loving.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.720]   So what do we do?
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.560]   My third and final point this evening
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.080]   is we must return to God, his word,
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.920]   his desires, and his people.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:25.800]   See, what's happened is we've made following our heart,
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.280]   our God, instead of following God's heart.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.900]   I'm telling you this evening, don't follow a heart
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.360]   that's not chasing after the heart of God.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:38.040]   Do not follow a heart that's not chasing
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.960]   after the heart of God.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.960]   Second Chronicles 7, 14, speaking of the temple,
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.280]   this is before that our bodies became the temple of God.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.800]   Before the Holy Spirit resided in us,
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.800]   Solomon built a temple and dedicated it to the Lord.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.080]   And he said this, "If my people who are called by my name
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.660]   "will humble themselves and pray and seek my face
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.120]   "and turn from their wicked ways,
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.240]   "then I will hear from them and I will forgive their sin
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.600]   "and will heal their land."
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.760]   Can we heal their land?
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.640]   Can we read that together?
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.600]   Can we read that together this evening?
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.640]   Yes, good, okay, me and my friend,
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.240]   we're gonna read this together, ready?
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:20.520]   "If my people who are called by my name
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:25.360]   "will humble themselves and pray and seek my face
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.720]   "and turn from their wicked ways,
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:32.560]   "then I will hear from heaven and I will forgive their sin
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.840]   "and will heal their land."
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.680]   Amen.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.080]   We have to return to God.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.040]   I made a mess of my thermostat.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.520]   I made a mess of my air condition.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.960]   I made a mess of the situation.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.080]   I was in a hot mess.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.560]   I woke up the next morning, I called an expert.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.360]   I begged and pleaded, "Can you please come over today?"
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.600]   He came over, he knew exactly what to do.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.920]   He knew exactly what had happened.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.680]   He knew I had shorted out my AC.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.520]   He went in there, he repaired it,
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.560]   he swapped out the thermostat, he put the nest on.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.240]   He put the nest on, all within minutes,
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.320]   the situation was resolved.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:14.280]   Your sin and the sin of our country is no problem for God.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.160]   He can resolve it in a moment.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.360]   He can touch Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump right now
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.000]   and save them both.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.840]   He can make them the most radical Christians
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.680]   you've ever thought of.
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.400]   He's that big, he can do that.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.160]   He can do incredible things, but are we praying for that?
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:34.400]   Have we spent hours on our knees begging him for that?
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.120]   Have we pleaded with him more than we've posted on Facebook
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.760]   or shared our opinions or shot over a YouTube video?
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.040]   Have we begged God?
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.760]   Have we taken off of work
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.440]   and spent an entire day on our face?
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:50.440]   Lord, please, please, please save our country.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:55.080]   God, help us, we need your help.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.560]   Our problem is not a problem for God,
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.600]   the creator of the heavens and the earth.
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.800]   He can effortlessly remedy this,
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.440]   but we need to start by turning to him.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.280]   I'm just gonna give you some application now.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.320]   One, confess your sins personally.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.640]   Sex outside of marriage of any kind,
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:16.940]   any abortion that you've participated in,
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:20.200]   confess it, repent, turn from it, don't hide it,
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.160]   don't feel like you gotta take it to your grave, you don't.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.880]   God loves you, he's crazy about you, he delights.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:29.000]   The scripture says he delights in forgiving you.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.320]   He delights in it.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.840]   He finds joy when you come to him with your sin
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:34.840]   to forgive you.
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:38.640]   Spend extended time in prayer.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:43.440]   I think you should seriously, prayerfully consider
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.760]   taking a vacation day between now and November 8th
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:52.040]   and going somewhere and praying the entire day,
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.080]   pleading with God.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:57.880]   Your hope is not in a vote,
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.400]   but your vote should reflect who your hope is in.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.160]   Your hope is not in a vote,
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.280]   but your vote should reflect who your hope is in.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.400]   And so to cast a vote, I would not do so
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.000]   without lots and lots of prayer.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.920]   If abortion or same-sex attraction is a part of your journey,
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.640]   please not only receive grace and forgiveness,
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.480]   but tell your story.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.820]   It's a powerful tool in the hands of God.
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.080]   I've seen him do incredible work.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.800]   I've had a front row seat here for the past 10 years
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.560]   watching him do incredible work
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.600]   through people who will tell their story.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:38.000]   And some of you, and I know this is no small ask,
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.200]   but I've gotta ask some of you to do something
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.080]   very difficult and very important.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:47.840]   I need some of you to move to Washington, D.C.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:52.480]   I need some of you to run for politics.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.360]   I need some of you to learn to navigate Washington, D.C.,
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.640]   to begin to study it.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.600]   I know that not all of you can, but if you can, you should.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:04.520]   Some of you are here, you're 27 years old,
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.480]   and eight years from now,
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:08.040]   I would love to personally vote for you
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.680]   for the President of the United States of America.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.960]   And so you need to learn and you need to study.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.680]   And some of you, right now, the Lord may be calling you
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.960]   to something like this, that you would go
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.000]   and spend your entire life
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.640]   to fighting these battles that matter to God.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.440]   And I don't just mean the two that we discussed tonight.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.800]   That you would learn the ins and the outs,
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.800]   that you would redeem a biblical worldview in our land.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:42.440]   We need to learn to winsomely engage on this topic.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.680]   And so when we meet with someone who disagrees,
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.720]   they should know three things.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.560]   They should know, first, that we love them.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.360]   Secondly, they should know that we disagree and why.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.160]   And then thirdly, they should know the hope
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.400]   that the gospel of Jesus Christ offers.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.920]   If they do not know these three things,
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.360]   if it's not clearly apparent in our dialogue
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.360]   or discussion with them, then we failed.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:10.560]   If you're a follower of Christ,
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.520]   you need to know what God's word says.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.840]   This is a game of truth, and I'll be honest,
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.480]   I've taught some of this before
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.840]   in a much more pastoral way, less political way.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.720]   You can go find those messages online.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:25.240]   But the truth is more and more difficult to find.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.040]   But it's always found here.
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:31.080]   It's always found right here.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:37.080]   And so make sure you belong to a church
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.520]   that teaches the whole truth,
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:42.560]   and a community that will help you follow God's heart
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.760]   as opposed to your own.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:49.080]   God working through you is the solution.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.400]   So get ready, friends.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.640]   We, you and me, all of us,
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.880]   God and His sovereignty had you here tonight.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.320]   We have work to do.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:05.240]   Could you imagine a land?
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.280]   Or could you imagine that in our lifetime
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:12.280]   that we would see the last baby killed?
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.040]   That it would never happen again
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.520]   because of God working through your life?
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.880]   Could you imagine in our lifetime
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:23.800]   if we've seen the LGBTQ community infiltrate the church
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.400]   in ways that are positive,
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.760]   that they would stand up and tell their story
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.680]   and talk about how they are resisting
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.520]   the natural urges of their flesh
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.920]   to hold out for something that is better,
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.200]   something that is more godly, an eternal reward,
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.680]   and not doing so out of anger,
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.520]   and not doing so feeling like they got ripped off,
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.920]   but doing so believing that God
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.840]   has something better for them?
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.960]   Can you imagine this land?
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:56.240]   You have an opportunity.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:01.820]   In summary, understand God's clear instruction.
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.880]   Understand the consequences
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.420]   of not observing God's clear instruction.
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:13.420]   And return to God His word, His desires, and His people.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:19.840]   Behind me is the sun over the horizon.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:27.560]   When the Constitution was signed
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.240]   by all the delegates in 1787,
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.280]   Ben Franklin sat there.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.860]   Some of them came in reluctantly.
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:40.200]   And Mr. Franklin was in his 80s.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:44.080]   And as the document was signed,
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:47.440]   he confessed that he had spent many days daydreaming,
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:50.160]   looking at the back of Washington's chair,
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.880]   'cause on the back of Washington's chair was a painting.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.040]   It was a sun over a horizon.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.860]   And Mr. Franklin had wondered,
[00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:01.800]   is that sun rising or is that sun setting?
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:07.780]   And as the Constitution was signed,
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:12.360]   he said that today, over the land of America,
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.200]   I believe it is rising.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.800]   I celebrate with you that it is rising.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.000]   Friends, today, tonight, this evening,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.840]   I stand before you and tell you I believe it is setting.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:34.160]   I believe that we may be the generation
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.960]   that loses our country to the hands of the enemy.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.760]   And I beg you to care,
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:49.680]   to stop following feelings and emotions in your heart
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:55.560]   and care enough what God's word says
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:58.920]   and speak it boldly and winsomely
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.840]   and learn your message and tell your story
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.480]   and engage everyone you can
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:08.240]   and beg and plead for a revival.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.560]   Are you a follower of Christ?
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:16.280]   Then follow Christ with everything.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:20.800]   Follow Jesus with your all.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.760]   Live a life that matters
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:30.120]   and save our land so that the sun would rise again.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.760]   I'm gonna pray that you would.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Father, as we move to singing a song,
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.800]   worshiping you,
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:49.920]   God, the creator of the heavens and the earth,
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:56.000]   Father, I beg you to help us,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.160]   to save us,
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:04.880]   to redirect a stir in our hearts,
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.960]   a vision so much bigger than us,
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.680]   one that we can't lose sight of.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:13.040]   Father, if I've said anything,
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.480]   Holy Spirit, powerful God,
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:19.440]   if I've said anything that is inconsistent with your desire,
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:22.160]   I pray that it would be forgotten even now
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.280]   before anyone gets up from their chair,
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.840]   anyone who's listening, that it would be forgotten.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:31.640]   But God, anything that I said
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.760]   that is completely consistent with your character
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:35.920]   and your will and your desires revealed to us
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.160]   through your scriptures and your Holy Spirit,
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:41.840]   allow it to stir in our hearts and our minds
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:43.360]   until we are moved to action.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:50.480]   Father, help us to defend those
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.320]   who cannot defend themselves.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:57.360]   Father, help us to make what has been said
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:01.240]   to be about love actually about love.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:05.120]   Father, help us to engage the lost,
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:09.040]   heal and strengthen your church,
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.920]   and use us, God.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:18.360]   May millennials be the most powerful force,
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:22.920]   the most powerful demographic of people
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.800]   this world has ever seen.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.520]   In the name of Jesus.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.720]   Amen.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:41.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
