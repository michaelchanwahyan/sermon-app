00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,800
 Across the world, pain comes in many forms.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:23,000
 War, poverty, persecution.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,160
 We hear bad news every day.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,160
 Your ability to worship is restricted or forbidden.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,360
 And in the hardest to reach places in the world,

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,280
 bad news isn't just on social media or TV.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,320
 It's on their streets.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,920
 It's breaking up their homes.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,320
 It's attacking their churches.

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,120
 These distant places are home to billions

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,360
 of people who have never heard the name of Jesus.

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,160
 How will they hear?

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,640
 Who will tell them there is hope for the hopeless,

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,600
 food for the hungry, water for the thirsty?

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,400
 The gospel of Jesus for broken sinners.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,000
 You have heard of it.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,600
 But who will tell them?

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:23,600
 [APPLAUSE]

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,000
 Really good to be at the porch.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,880
 I only have a few minutes tonight

22
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,880
 to talk about the greatest injustice in the world.

23
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,480
 So I'm just going to jump right in, if that's all right.

24
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,760
 Let me tell you where the next few minutes are going.

25
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,280
 At the end of our time together, I'm

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,440
 going to offer you a specific invitation

27
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:04,720
 to stand right where you are in this room,

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,760
 or I know I've prayed over those of you who are in Fort Worth,

29
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,040
 and Houston, and Austin, and Midland, and Scottsdale,

30
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,320
 and Boise, and Tulsa, and Cincinnati, and Des Moines,

31
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,680
 and Indianapolis, and Lafayette.

32
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,040
 So even though you're not in the room,

33
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:30,760
 this invitation is for you to stand right where you are.

34
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:38,640
 If you would be willing to put a stake in the ground tonight

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,880
 and say the following--

36
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,800
 I'm going to put it up here on the screen.

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,960
 If you'd be willing to say, God, I

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:57,480
 will do whatever you call me to do, no matter what it costs,

39
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,240
 to get the gospel to people who have never heard it.

40
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,000
 God, I will do whatever you call me to do,

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,680
 no matter what it costs, to get the gospel to people who've

42
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,240
 never heard it.

43
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:19,880
 So key words in the statement would be God.

44
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,760
 This is you standing before God.

45
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,000
 It's not about standing because somebody else is standing,

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,560
 or you think you should stand, or you feel bad sitting.

47
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:40,920
 It's about you soberly saying to the God who made you,

48
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,480
 who loves you, before whom you will stand one day,

49
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,760
 and to say that you will do whatever,

50
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,800
 so no strings attached.

51
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,760
 God, if that is to pack my bags and move somewhere else,

52
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,000
 anywhere else in the world, I will do it.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,200
 If that is to sell my possessions, any possessions,

54
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:13,240
 if that is to stay single, or if that is to only marry somebody

55
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,620
 else who's saying the same thing,

56
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,680
 it would make no sense to say this and then marry somebody

57
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,040
 who's not saying this.

58
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
 So you're at a minimum reducing the number

59
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,000
 of people you would marry.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,480
 So we're talking about major decisions in your life,

61
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,280
 now, in the future, and the rest of your life.

62
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,960
 This is saying, God, whenever, wherever, however,

63
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:43,400
 whatever you call me to do, no matter what it costs,

64
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
 knowing that there is absolutely no way for you

65
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,360
 to carry out this commitment without cost,

66
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,800
 without sacrifice.

67
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
 This is not for everybody.

68
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,240
 Many of you are not ready to say this, so don't stand.

69
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,080
 We're talking about sacrifice to do what?

70
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:09,360
 To get the gospel, it's the good news of God's love in Jesus,

71
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,680
 to people, to men, women, and kids, and young adults,

72
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:25,920
 just like you and me, who follow this, have never heard it.

73
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:32,800
 And people who've never heard the gospel.

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,400
 I'm gonna show you a map up here on the screen

75
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,640
 that is based on a Research Joshua project,

76
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,520
 and we as Radical have worked with them together on,

77
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,600
 but there's obviously three main colors on this map.

78
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,120
 You've got green, yellow, and red.

79
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,280
 The green areas of this map represent places

80
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,800
 where the gospel has gone, where there are Christians

81
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,880
 in churches spreading the gospel.

82
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,480
 Obviously, it doesn't mean that everybody

83
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,640
 in those green areas is a follower of Jesus.

84
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,000
 We know that. It's not true in Texas,

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,320
 and there's a lot of Christians in churches in Texas.

86
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,520
 So the green areas are places where disciples have been made

87
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,720
 and churches have been planted,

88
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,560
 and there's gospel spreading that's able to happen.

89
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,600
 Yellow areas are places that are less reached by the gospel,

90
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,640
 and it's usually going in one of two directions.

91
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,280
 So either like, picture Europe.

92
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,160
 These are places, some of them,

93
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,280
 where the gospel used to be prevalent

94
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,400
 and has waned in influence,

95
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,960
 and so there's a lot less gospel access now,

96
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,320
 or it could be going the other way.

97
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,120
 The gospel's recently come to a place,

98
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,440
 and it's growing, but it's still not widespread.

99
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,560
 And then there's the red areas on this map,

100
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,080
 and the red areas are where unreached people live.

101
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,560
 And what that word "unreached" means is not just lost.

102
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,120
 It's not just that they are sinners

103
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,200
 who are separated from God by their sin.

104
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,880
 People are just like that in Dallas, Texas.

105
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,480
 The difference is there's Christians

106
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,520
 in churches in Dallas, Texas.

107
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,280
 In the middle of Saudi Arabia,

108
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,280
 there's very few Christians in very few churches,

109
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,400
 and what that means is if you live in Saudi Arabia,

110
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,080
 the likelihood is you've not been reached by the gospel.

111
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,360
 You don't have access to the gospel around you.

112
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,680
 You don't have a Christian or a church near you

113
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,440
 where somebody can share with you

114
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,400
 the good news of God's love in Jesus.

115
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,640
 You're unreached by it.

116
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,800
 Practically, what that means is you'd be born,

117
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,000
 and you'd live, and you'd die,

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,680
 and the likelihood is you'd never hear the gospel.

119
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,320
 This is why we don't say, "I don't know why we talk

120
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,520
 "about unreached people around the world.

121
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,080
 "I mean, there's unreached people in my office,

122
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,600
 "or there's unreached people in my neighborhood.

123
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,200
 "Those people are not unreached."

124
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,480
 You say, "How do you know?"

125
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,600
 'Cause they're in your office or your neighborhood.

126
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,000
 Like, they have access to the gospel.

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,840
 You're it.

128
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,960
 We're talking about people who don't have access

129
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,560
 to the gospel in this red area,

130
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,560
 and that red area includes about 3.2 billion people.

131
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,640
 3.2 billion people who will die

132
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,720
 without ever hearing the gospel

133
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,720
 if somebody doesn't go there,

134
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,200
 or if the few believers who are there

135
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,320
 don't get help and support.

136
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,160
 They're unreached.

137
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,080
 And here's the deal.

138
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,320
 I actually believe we can reach them.

139
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,120
 Not any one of us individually,

140
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,160
 but all of us together as the church.

141
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,400
 Think about the world we live in today,

142
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,600
 globalization, urbanization, the move of people to cities,

143
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,920
 ease of travel, new technologies.

144
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,760
 We have more opportunities to spread the gospel

145
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,120
 in the world than we've ever had before in history.

146
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,760
 The church in the first century could have only dreamed

147
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,520
 about the opportunities we have to reach the nations.

148
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,120
 It took them months to sail from one city to the next.

149
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,760
 You and I can get to the other side of the world

150
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,800
 in a day.

151
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,960
 They had to write letters that would take weeks,

152
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,160
 months to be delivered between social media,

153
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,920
 translation software, the metaverse,

154
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,720
 and we can communicate with people around the world

155
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,480
 in real time from what's in our pocket.

156
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,960
 I look out across this room,

157
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,640
 and I think about others in different places,

158
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,640
 and whether it's some who are college students

159
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,680
 getting degrees that will open doors,

160
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,720
 others who have degrees, have jobs,

161
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,080
 that have opened doors to get into places in the red.

162
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,880
 For any nurses, doctors, medical students,

163
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,480
 I could point you tonight to hundreds of jobs

164
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,120
 right in the heart of the Middle East for you to get,

165
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,160
 where they will pay you to come share the gospel there.

166
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,560
 I mean, they don't know that's what they're paying you to do.

167
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,120
 But the same's true for teachers, engineers,

168
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,040
 entrepreneurs, business leaders, fitness specialists.

169
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,400
 I could go on and on and on.

170
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,480
 In addition to all the jobs we can get here

171
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,960
 in one of the wealthiest places in the history of the world

172
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,680
 that can support work in the red.

173
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,840
 But it all starts with saying,

174
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,320
 God, I will do whatever you call me to do,

175
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,720
 no matter what it costs,

176
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,200
 to get the gospel to people who have never heard it.

177
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,400
 In order to lead to this invitation

178
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,760
 for some of you to stand and to say this,

179
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,400
 I actually wanna do something a little different.

180
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,480
 I wanna flip this idea around for a moment

181
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,480
 and ask the question, what if we don't stand and say this?

182
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,160
 In other words, what happens if we don't do

183
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,760
 whatever God calls us to do?

184
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,680
 What happens if we don't sacrifice,

185
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,000
 we don't get the gospel to people who've never heard it?

186
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 What happens to 3.2 billion people when they die

187
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,840
 if we don't get the gospel to them?

188
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,520
 That's a pretty important question, isn't it?

189
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,840
 For like 3 billion people in the world?

190
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:33,480
 And I think for most Christians in America

191
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,120
 where the gospel has come,

192
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,480
 either we don't realize there are 3 billion people

193
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,560
 in the world who've never heard the gospel,

194
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,480
 or we think they'll be okay when they die,

195
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,560
 they'll go to heaven.

196
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,840
 That's the only answer I can come up with

197
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,920
 for why we are not talking about this

198
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,680
 all the time in our churches

199
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,200
 and everywhere in Christianity today.

200
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,400
 Like if we believed 3 billion people were dying

201
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,320
 and going to hell without ever hearing about heaven,

202
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,960
 I think we'd be talking about that all the time.

203
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,480
 Like we have to do something.

204
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,120
 And not just a few of us here or there, like all of us,

205
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,200
 we gotta do something, we gotta pull our resources together,

206
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,600
 we gotta go, we gotta send, we gotta get behind

207
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,640
 brothers and sisters who are already there.

208
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,760
 Like this is not tolerable.

209
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,320
 We're passionate about justice.

210
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,320
 Is there any greater injustice than 3 billion people

211
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,000
 going to an eternal hell while all the people who know

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,040
 how to go to an eternal heaven sit back

213
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,320
 and do little to nothing?

214
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,920
 Which is, by the way, what we are doing.

215
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,960
 Like we've done the research.

216
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:56,120
 We spend most of our money on ourselves.

217
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,400
 We give some of our money to churches and ministries.

218
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,200
 And we spend most of that money in churches and ministries

219
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,480
 on making ourselves more comfortable in our churches

220
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,960
 and ministries.

221
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,040
 And then there's a small percentage of the money

222
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,600
 that we give to churches and ministries

223
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,400
 that goes toward what we normally call it, like missions,

224
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,040
 overseas to other countries, to work in other countries.

225
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,360
 We give a very small percentage to that.

226
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,280
 But out of that percentage that we give to missions,

227
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,480
 do you know how much of that goes to red areas on the map?

228
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,480
 Approximately 1% of our missions giving.

229
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:49,360
 We spend 99% of our missions giving on green areas,

230
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,320
 Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe.

231
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,560
 I'm not saying it's bad to give to what God is doing

232
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,840
 among our brothers and sisters in green areas.

233
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,480
 But we're fooling ourselves if we think we're passionate

234
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,240
 about giving to missions while we're ignoring

235
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,000
 3 billion people who've never heard the gospel.

236
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,880
 And even missionaries, most missionaries who go,

237
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,280
 go to places that are green on this map,

238
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,240
 which I guess makes sense if the people in the red

239
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,240
 are going to heaven.

240
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,200
 But it makes no sense if they're going to hell.

241
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,800
 So what does the Bible say?

242
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,120
 What does God tell us happens to them?

243
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,040
 I just want to show you what the Bible says about them

244
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:48,480
 in a way that I hope will leave us with a clear answer

245
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,520
 to what happens if we don't do whatever God calls us to do

246
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,760
 no matter the cost to get the gospel to them.

247
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,800
 So could I just encourage you to write this down

248
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,520
 either physically in some way,

249
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,640
 or at least imprint it on your mind and your heart

250
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,920
 so there's clarity about what happens to them,

251
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,840
 to this 3.2 billion people?

252
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:16,000
 So first thing we know about them,

253
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,680
 this is all, if you want to follow along in your Bible,

254
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,280
 I want you to pull it out, Romans.

255
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,800
 We'll start in chapter one and then we're going to be

256
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,440
 in Romans for all these different things

257
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,400
 we're going to learn about them.

258
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,920
 So starting in Romans one, verse 18,

259
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,760
 if you don't have a Bible, you can follow along on the screen.

260
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,200
 So first thing we know about these 3.2 billion,

261
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,680
 they have knowledge of God.

262
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,160
 They have knowledge of God.

263
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,400
 This is Romans chapter one, verse 18.

264
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,240
 The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven

265
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,400
 against all the godlessness and wickedness of men

266
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,160
 who suppress the truth of God by their wickedness

267
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,920
 since what may be known about God is plain to them

268
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,720
 because God has made it plain to them.

269
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,680
 For since the creation of the world,

270
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,240
 God's invisible qualities, his eternal power

271
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,080
 and divine nature have been clearly seen,

272
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,480
 being understood from what has been made

273
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,480
 so that men are without excuse, clearly seen who God is.

274
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,680
 Then it says in verse 21, although they knew God,

275
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,800
 they have knowledge of God.

276
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,480
 All the people in the red, no matter where they live,

277
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,240
 who they are, have knowledge of God.

278
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,800
 God's revealed himself in creation

279
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,320
 to every single one of them.

280
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:36,120
 Of course, they don't all acknowledge or believe in God,

281
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,160
 which leads to the second thing about them.

282
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,240
 They have all rejected God.

283
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,440
 Romans chapter one, verse 21 makes this clear.

284
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,840
 Although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God

285
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,480
 nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile

286
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,400
 and their foolish hearts were darkened.

287
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,240
 Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools

288
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,880
 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images

289
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,160
 made to look like mortal man and birds

290
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,680
 and animals and reptiles.

291
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,640
 Therefore God gave them over

292
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,960
 from the sinful desire of their hearts

293
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,720
 to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies

294
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,680
 with one another.

295
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,080
 They exchanged the truth of God for a lie

296
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,080
 and they worshiped and served created things

297
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,360
 rather than the creator who is forever praised.

298
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,280
 So they all rejected God.

299
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,840
 They've not glorified him as God.

300
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,960
 They've turned aside from him as God.

301
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,240
 And to be clear, this is not just talking about

302
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,000
 them, it's talking about every single person in the world,

303
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 yellow, green, red, including every single one of us

304
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,800
 in this gathering tonight.

305
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,240
 This is the reality of sin in every single person's heart,

306
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,720
 in my heart, in your heart, and in every person

307
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,560
 around the world.

308
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,840
 We have all sinned against God.

309
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,560
 We've turned aside from God's ways to our own ways,

310
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,360
 from God's truth to our thoughts.

311
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,920
 We have rejected God and they have all rejected God.

312
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,320
 Which leads to the third truth about them.

313
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,560
 And again, this is not even just talking

314
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,400
 about those in the red.

315
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,240
 In a way, this applies to all of us.

316
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,240
 None of them are innocent before God.

317
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,520
 Not one of them.

318
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,920
 These initial chapters in Romans are so sobering.

319
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,920
 From Romans 1, 18 to 2, 16, you see the sinfulness

320
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,280
 of Gentiles outside of the covenant people of God.

321
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,640
 Then around chapter two, verse 17,

322
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,240
 all the way to chapter three, verse eight,

323
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,360
 you see the Jewish people, covenant people of God,

324
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,760
 described in their sinfulness.

325
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,640
 And then you get to verse nine, or verse 10,

326
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,680
 it says, "As it is written, there is no one righteous,

327
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,840
 "not even one."

328
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,080
 No one.

329
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,920
 So see the repetition here, who understands?

330
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,480
 No one who seeks God.

331
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,000
 All have turned away.

332
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,400
 They've become worthless.

333
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,740
 There is no one who does good, not even one.

334
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,280
 Could it be any clearer that all people

335
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,000
 are guilty of sin before God?

336
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,760
 And here's why this is so important,

337
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,680
 because I think about how this question is most often asked.

338
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,600
 Somebody will say to me, "What do you think happens

339
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,240
 "to the innocent man or woman or child

340
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,040
 "in X part of the world who never hears the gospel?"

341
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,360
 If you ask me that question, I would say,

342
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,400
 based on the word of God,

343
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,520
 that person without question goes to heaven,

344
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,020
 even though they've never heard the gospel.

345
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:33,200
 If they're innocent, why do they need to hear

346
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,760
 how they can be saved from sin?

347
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,120
 Of course they go to heaven.

348
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,520
 The only problem is they don't exist.

349
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,000
 There's no innocent people in the world

350
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
 just waiting to hear the gospel.

351
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,480
 There's guilty people all over the world.

352
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,480
 That's why they need to hear the gospel.

353
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,000
 See how even when we ask the question,

354
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,640
 we always bias it against God and toward us

355
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,560
 as if God is unjustly putting innocent people

356
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
 in a state of condemnation.

357
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,480
 We have no clue the depth of the sinfulness

358
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,600
 of our own hearts.

359
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,320
 The sinfulness in the world around us.

360
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,080
 There is no one who is innocent before God,

361
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,520
 including every single person in the red

362
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,520
 who is guilty before God, which leads to truth number four.

363
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,520
 They all stand condemned for rejecting God.

364
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,680
 This is the end of this argument,

365
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,720
 this part in Romans chapter three, verse 19.

366
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,000
 We know that whatever the law says,

367
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,360
 it says to those who are under the law,

368
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,640
 so that every mouth is silenced.

369
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,320
 The whole world is held accountable to God.

370
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,200
 And no one, there it is again,

371
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,160
 will be declared righteous in God's sight

372
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,040
 by the works of the law.

373
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,120
 In other words, by what he does.

374
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,960
 Rather through the law, we become conscious of sin.

375
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,560
 Not only are all people guilty,

376
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,440
 but there's no amount of good we can do

377
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,200
 to overcome our guilt.

378
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,960
 All people are condemned for rejecting God.

379
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,960
 And that's true regardless of whether or not

380
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,840
 someone has heard the gospel.

381
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,840
 And this is really significant because,

382
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,360
 well, let me ask you a question.

383
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,120
 Like, think about this with me.

384
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:23,120
 Do you think it would be just for God

385
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,520
 to condemn someone to hell for not believing in the gospel

386
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,000
 if they never had a chance to hear the gospel?

387
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,360
 Do you think it would be just for God

388
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,680
 to condemn someone to hell for not believing in the gospel

389
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,240
 when they never even had a chance to hear the gospel?

390
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,000
 I think the answer to that question is no.

391
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,560
 Not accountable for what they've not heard.

392
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:05,080
 At the same time, that doesn't mean they go to heaven

393
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,240
 because they're condemned for rejecting the God

394
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,520
 that has been clearly shown to them.

395
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,920
 And here's why this is so important,

396
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,320
 'cause people start to think,

397
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,760
 well, maybe, maybe if,

398
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,960
 because they haven't heard the gospel,

399
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,920
 that God will let them into heaven.

400
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,080
 God is loving, gracious.

401
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,400
 We know he wants them in heaven.

402
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,680
 If they haven't heard the gospel,

403
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,920
 maybe he will let them in because they haven't heard.

404
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,560
 But let's think about that for a second.

405
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,800
 If that were true,

406
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,720
 then what is the worst thing we could do

407
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,280
 for all the people in the red?

408
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,920
 Tell them the gospel.

409
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,800
 If they have not heard the gospel,

410
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,000
 and that is some kind of pass into heaven,

411
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,040
 and we get there and we're like,

412
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,560
 I wanna tell you the good news,

413
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,560
 and because we've come with the good news,

414
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,120
 now there's a chance they could go to hell,

415
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,760
 they'd be like, just keep it to yourself.

416
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,040
 And just think about it practically.

417
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,560
 You walk up on the streets of somebody in Dallas,

418
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,040
 you say to someone, have you heard

419
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,080
 the God's love for you and Jesus?

420
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,360
 They say, no, I don't know anything about that.

421
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,280
 If you believe that person is going to heaven

422
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,040
 precisely because they've never heard,

423
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,440
 then what do you say to them?

424
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,200
 Say, well, somebody tries to tell you about Jesus,

425
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,720
 just put your fingers in your ears

426
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,360
 and start yelling really loud and run the other way.

427
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,840
 And this is the whole point of the enterprise of the church,

428
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,800
 this is what we do, this is good news

429
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,520
 that we proclaim to people who have rejected God.

430
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,560
 The point here is that regardless

431
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,880
 of whether or not someone has heard the gospel,

432
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,760
 all people stand guilty before God and sin

433
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,720
 and deserve eternal separation from Him.

434
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,440
 They all stand condemned for rejecting God.

435
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,800
 And at this point, I picture Paul writing the book of Romans

436
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,080
 and it's been two chapters worth

437
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,560
 of just the sinfulness of man,

438
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,000
 all the way to chapter three, verse 20.

439
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,280
 Picture him with tears in his eyes,

440
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,280
 but then I picture him picking up the pen

441
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,280
 and writing, but now, our righteousness from God,

442
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,480
 apart from the law has been made known.

443
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,800
 And this righteousness from God comes through faith

444
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,200
 in Jesus Christ for all who believe.

445
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,440
 There is no difference for all have sinned

446
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,120
 and fall what, short of the glory of God and our.

447
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,680
 Oh, don't just memorize the bad news.

448
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,320
 They are, I think I got it up here,

449
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,480
 justified freely by His grace

450
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,920
 and the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.

451
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,200
 Truth number five, God loves them

452
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,800
 and God has made a way of salvation

453
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,640
 for all 3.2 billion of them.

454
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,200
 God loves them just like God loves us.

455
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,760
 This is the gospel.

456
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,920
 God has made a way for us to be saved from our sin.

457
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:13,480
 I don't assume everybody who's here tonight

458
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,200
 has put your faith in Jesus.

459
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,120
 Hear this good news.

460
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,240
 Maybe this is the first time you are hearing the gospel.

461
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,240
 It's the greatest news in the world.

462
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,200
 Though you have sinned against God

463
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,720
 and are separated from Him

464
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,840
 and deserve eternal separation from Him,

465
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,280
 God has not left you alone in this state.

466
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,560
 God has come to us in the person of Jesus.

467
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,640
 He has lived the life we could not live,

468
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,760
 a life of no sin.

469
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,680
 And then even though He had no sin for which to die,

470
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,680
 He chose to die on a cross to pay the price

471
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,960
 for the sins of anyone who would trust in Him.

472
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,520
 He lived the life we couldn't live.

473
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,200
 He died the death that we deserve to die.

474
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,800
 And the good news keeps getting better

475
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,840
 'cause He didn't stay dead for long.

476
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,400
 Three days later, He rose from the grave

477
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,000
 in victory over sin and death

478
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,800
 so that anyone, anywhere,

479
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,360
 including anybody in this gathering

480
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,720
 and anybody in the red who turns from their sin

481
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,000
 and trusts in Jesus,

482
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,320
 God will forgive you of all your sin

483
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,800
 and restore you to relationship with Him for eternal life.

484
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,080
 (congregation applauding)

485
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,080
 It's the gospel.

486
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,240
 It's the greatest news in the world.

487
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,400
 (congregation laughing)

488
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,040
 And it's not just for us.

489
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,480
 It's for them too.

490
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,680
 Which leads to truth number six.

491
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:37,720
 They cannot come to God apart from faith in Jesus.

492
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:44,320
 This is the way to eternal life.

493
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,840
 Faith in Jesus, verse 27 in Romans 3.

494
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
 "Where then is boasting?

495
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,680
 "It's excluded.

496
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,520
 "On what principle?

497
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,340
 "That of observing the law?

498
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,920
 "No, but on that of faith.

499
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,800
 "A man is justified, made right before God

500
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,080
 "by faith apart from observing the law."

501
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,960
 Not based on what we do.

502
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,040
 Is God the God of Jews only?

503
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,080
 Is He not the God of Gentiles too?

504
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,120
 Yes, of Gentiles too.

505
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,760
 So there's only one God who will justify

506
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,320
 the circumcised, the Jewish people,

507
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,280
 by faith and the uncircumcised,

508
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,480
 the Gentiles, through that same faith.

509
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,600
 This is how they can be saved from their sin,

510
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,080
 by faith in Jesus.

511
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,280
 Which is, well,

512
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:32,240
 3.2 billion people living with all kinds of ideas

513
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,240
 of how to get to God.

514
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,520
 I think about, I think about standing

515
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,120
 in one of those red areas, outside a temple.

516
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,600
 One guy worships at that temple,

517
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,140
 another guy worships at a different temple

518
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,440
 for a different religion.

519
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,720
 And I'm standing there, we're talking.

520
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,800
 And they're talking to me like,

521
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,320
 "Hey, our religions are fundamentally the same.

522
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,860
 "They're just kind of superficially different.

523
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,200
 "Like we all, we may use different terms,

524
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,100
 "we all can't believe the same thing."

525
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,000
 I'm just listening.

526
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,720
 And after a while I said,

527
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,100
 "It's almost like you guys picture God,

528
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,180
 "or whatever you wanna call Him,

529
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,180
 "at the top of a mountain,

530
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,600
 "and we're all at the bottom of a mountain.

531
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,640
 "And you may take this path up,

532
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,680
 "and I may take this path up,

533
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,420
 "but in the end we'll find ourselves in the same place."

534
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,520
 And they smiled, they said,

535
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,020
 "Exactly, you understand."

536
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:21,600
 I said, "Well, what if I told you

537
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,980
 "that the God at the top of the mountain

538
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,680
 "didn't wait for us to find our way up there,

539
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,540
 "but He actually came down the mountain to where we are,

540
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,020
 "and took us up Himself?"

541
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,000
 They said, "That would be great."

542
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,280
 I said, "Let me introduce you to the difference.

543
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,560
 "This is Jesus, God has come to us.

544
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,900
 "It's taken His hand, it's trusting in Him.

545
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,920
 "This is how people can be saved,

546
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,440
 "through faith in Jesus."

547
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,120
 But that brings us back to the question, doesn't it?

548
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,460
 Like how can people put their faith in Jesus,

549
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,580
 when they've never heard about Jesus?

550
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:57,200
 And that's the exact question that Paul gets to

551
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,040
 in Romans 10.

552
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
 So if you've got your Bible, just keep turning over there.

553
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,460
 Romans chapter 10, verse 13,

554
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,460
 "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

555
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,820
 "How then can they call on the one

556
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,560
 "they've not believed in?

557
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,100
 "And how can they believe in the one

558
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,260
 "of whom they've not heard?

559
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,360
 "And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?

560
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,860
 "And how can anyone preach unless they're sent?

561
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,220
 "As it's written, how beautiful are the feet

562
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,660
 "of those who bring good news."

563
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,420
 The picture here is crystal clear.

564
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,060
 People can't put their faith in Jesus

565
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,140
 if they don't hear about Jesus.

566
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:36,260
 And if they can't put their faith in Jesus,

567
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,180
 because they've not heard about Jesus,

568
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,100
 then they can't be saved from their sin.

569
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,320
 That's why when you get down to verse 17,

570
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,500
 you can read it, I don't have it up here,

571
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,020
 but faith comes by hearing,

572
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,320
 and hearing through the word of Jesus.

573
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,600
 So get the picture.

574
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,780
 Three billion people

575
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:56,340
 that can't go to heaven

576
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:01,340
 if they don't hear about the one who makes heaven possible.

577
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,540
 And it's symbol logic.

578
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,800
 They won't hear unless somebody tells them.

579
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,700
 Which leads to the last thing about them,

580
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,320
 and it's where you and I come in.

581
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:21,980
 Jesus has left us in this world

582
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,860
 to get the gospel to them.

583
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:32,300
 Jesus has left you and me in this world

584
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,260
 to do whatever he calls us to do,

585
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,820
 no matter what it costs, to get the gospel to them.

586
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,780
 Right before Jesus went to heaven,

587
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,280
 what did he tell his followers to do?

588
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,660
 One thing, make disciples, where?

589
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,020
 All the nations.

590
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,820
 Not just in one place.

591
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,020
 It's not an option for my people.

592
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,180
 We don't focus just on one place.

593
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,860
 We're going all the places.

594
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:04,020
 All the peoples, nations, ethnic groups of the world.

595
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,420
 You'll receive my power when my Holy Spirit comes upon you,

596
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:11,220
 so you'll be my witnesses to the ends of the earth,

597
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,340
 to all the people.

598
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,780
 Let me show you this in what we just read in Romans 10.

599
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,660
 Look at the verbs in this passage in reverse,

600
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,500
 and as you do, you'll see God's plan

601
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,460
 for the gospel go into the red.

602
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,060
 Watch this, so sent.

603
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:33,880
 So it all starts with Jesus sending his followers,

604
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,060
 and when he sends them to go out,

605
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,780
 what do they go out to do?

606
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,780
 To preach.

607
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,100
 That doesn't mean stand on a stage

608
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,980
 in front of a bunch of people.

609
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,980
 That means just tell somebody, right?

610
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,560
 Speak about the good news of God's love in Jesus.

611
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,940
 Proclaim it.

612
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,780
 So Jesus sends his followers, his followers preach,

613
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,540
 and when they preach, people will hear.

614
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,420
 Makes sense, unless we're preaching to a wall.

615
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,940
 All right, share, somebody will hear,

616
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,220
 and when they hear, what will happen?

617
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,180
 They'll believe.

618
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,860
 Now, we know not everybody who hears believes.

619
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,060
 Obviously, we know that.

620
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,340
 At the same time, think about this.

621
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,260
 Revelation chapter seven, verse nine and 10 says,

622
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,980
 "One day is coming when a multitude

623
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,960
 "that no one could count from every nation,

624
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,600
 "every tribe, every people, and every language

625
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,620
 "is gonna gather around the throne

626
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,580
 "of our God singing his praises."

627
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,460
 You know what that means?

628
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,540
 You can go to any people group in the red,

629
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,300
 any nation, any language in the red,

630
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,560
 you can share this good news.

631
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,020
 You know somebody's coming out.

632
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,180
 Somebody's gonna be there, it's guaranteed.

633
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:43,660
 So people will hear, and somebody's gonna believe,

634
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,140
 and when they believe, they will call,

635
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,700
 and when they call on the name of the Lord,

636
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,860
 they will be what?

637
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,700
 Saved.

638
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,460
 So there's the plan.

639
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,300
 God's designed for the gospel to get to the red,

640
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,680
 so let's look at the plan and just ask the question,

641
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,320
 where is the only place this plan can break down?

642
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,160
 Well, let's start from where we left off.

643
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,120
 Everyone who calls the name of the Lord will be saved,

644
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,840
 so we know that.

645
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,600
 Will those who believe call on his name?

646
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,960
 Yes.

647
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,080
 Will those who hear believe?

648
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,320
 Again, like we said, not everybody,

649
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,200
 but some will, guaranteed.

650
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,880
 Will those who, followers of Jesus,

651
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,700
 who are sent proclaim the gospel?

652
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,660
 Will they hear?

653
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,240
 Yeah, that'll happen as long as we're not preaching

654
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,440
 to a wall.

655
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,420
 The only place where this potentially breaks down

656
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:43,080
 is if those who are sent by Jesus refuse to go

657
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,880
 and proclaim this good news.

658
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,040
 That's the only potential breakdown.

659
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,060
 And we'll ask the question,

660
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,920
 is Jesus still sending his followers?

661
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,680
 Has he taken a generation off?

662
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,580
 Has he said, you know, I'm gonna find another way.

663
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,540
 People say to me, well, surely God has other ways.

664
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,260
 Like he works in dreams and visions

665
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,660
 and all kinds of different places in the world.

666
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,940
 And I could tell you all kinds of stories

667
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,460
 about dreams and visions.

668
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,500
 We see those in the Bible.

669
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,020
 You won't find a one verse in the Bible

670
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,260
 where the gospel is going forward

671
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,020
 apart from a human instrument proclaiming it.

672
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,780
 I got all kinds of stories about dreams and visions

673
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,540
 where God is also providing people.

674
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,860
 God could write Romans in the sky tonight

675
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,020
 and take care of this.

676
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,020
 Everybody be reached just like that.

677
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,740
 But he's chosen not to do that.

678
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,520
 Instead he's chosen in his grace to invite you and me

679
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,440
 to join with him in doing this

680
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,160
 and making the greatest news in the world

681
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,360
 known all over the world.

682
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,620
 And the only potential breakdown

683
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,760
 is when followers of Jesus say,

684
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,000
 no, we're just gonna live our lives

685
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,200
 in places where the gospel has gone.

686
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,320
 And we're gonna turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to them.

687
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,960
 We're basically gonna create a whole culture of Christianity

688
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,000
 cultural, comfortable, casual Christianity

689
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,640
 that revolves around us and ignores them.

690
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,740
 And that's how we're gonna live our lives.

691
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:11,160
 Maybe we'll throw pennies to them.

692
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:16,160
 Maybe a few people will go and do something about that.

693
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,880
 And tonight I'm inviting you to change that.

694
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,880
 I'm inviting you to refuse to settle

695
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,360
 for a casual, comfortable, cultural Christianity

696
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,040
 that turns a blind eye and deaf ear

697
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,760
 to 3.2 billion people on their way to hell

698
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,680
 who need to hear the greatest news in the world

699
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,360
 about how life forever in heaven is possible with Jesus.

700
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:43,160
 You say, well, what can I do to change that?

701
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,200
 I'm only one person.

702
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,640
 Well, of course you are.

703
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,160
 We all are.

704
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,040
 God made us that way.

705
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,440
 But so are they.

706
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,440
 I know I've mentioned 3 billion

707
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,320
 over and over and over again.

708
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,460
 But these are individual people, see them.

709
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:05,040
 We're talking about Hajira in Afghanistan.

710
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,920
 Her people groups Pashtoon,

711
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,260
 largest people group in Afghanistan.

712
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,000
 She and her close knit tribe live by a code

713
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,520
 of protecting each other's honor

714
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,860
 and showing generous hospitality.

715
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,440
 She works hard for her family day in and day out

716
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,560
 in a barren mountainous region where they live

717
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,180
 that is totally unreached by the gospel.

718
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,920
 We're talking about Tahil in Somalia.

719
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,000
 Lives in the capital Mogadishu.

720
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,900
 Port city just north of the equator on the Indian Ocean.

721
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,760
 Most of the men he knows have left Somalia.

722
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,040
 He's stayed in the middle of this impoverished country,

723
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,160
 convinced this is the best way he can care for his parents

724
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,660
 and his wife and his children.

725
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,400
 We're talking about Amir and Aliyah in Yemen.

726
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,600
 Older brother, younger sister.

727
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,040
 Picture childlike zeal for life,

728
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,400
 even though they live in one of the largest

729
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,680
 humanitarian crises in the world right now.

730
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,200
 Surrounded by war and conflict, they were born into it.

731
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,760
 They have parents who are struggling every day

732
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,880
 to find food for them.

733
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:16,840
 And here tonight, in a way maybe you didn't see coming,

734
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,440
 what Jesus is saying about each of them.

735
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,440
 'Cause they all, Hajira, Tahil, Amir, and Aliyah,

736
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,080
 they all have knowledge of God.

737
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,640
 They have all rejected God.

738
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,120
 They're all guilty of sin.

739
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,120
 They all stand condemned before God in their sin.

740
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:42,920
 Yet God loves all of them so much.

741
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,880
 God loves Hajira and loves her.

742
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,600
 God loves Tahil.

743
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,760
 God loves Amir.

744
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,840
 God loves Aliyah so much that he sent his son,

745
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,080
 Jesus God, in the flesh to give his life

746
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,520
 so they could have eternal life with him.

747
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,840
 But they can't experience eternal life

748
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,360
 if nobody tells them about Jesus.

749
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,000
 And Jesus is saying to a room full and other gatherings

750
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,080
 full of young adults who have this good news,

751
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,120
 I've left you here for a reason.

752
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:25,840
 And it's not to waste your life coasting out

753
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,560
 a comfortable Christian spin on the American dream.

754
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,880
 You were created for so much more than this.

755
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,320
 You've been put in a time and a place

756
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,720
 where there are more opportunities

757
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,440
 to get the greatest news in the world

758
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,600
 to people in the world than ever before.

759
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:48,480
 So don't spend your life on stuff that won't last.

760
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,400
 I know it's like college football season.

761
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,960
 We get so consumed with superficial battles.

762
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,000
 They're not real battles.

763
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,760
 They don't matter.

764
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,520
 Open your eyes and see what's worthy of your affections.

765
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,520
 Three billion Hagiras and Tahils and Amirs and Alias

766
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,880
 are on a road right now that leads to hell.

767
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,640
 Nobody's ever told them how they can go to heaven.

768
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,640
 And some of us are still thinking,

769
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,480
 how can that be just of God?

770
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:29,560
 And isn't it just like us in our sinfulness

771
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:36,120
 to point the finger at the supposed injustice of God

772
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,480
 in our minds while we excuse ourselves

773
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,760
 from obeying the command of God,

774
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,880
 clear command of God in our lives?

775
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,320
 I see it.

776
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,320
 Do you want justice?

777
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,920
 Then give your life.

778
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,200
 Do whatever it costs you to do

779
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,440
 to alleviate eternal suffering, eternal poverty,

780
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,520
 eternal slavery to sin for billions of people.

781
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,160
 That's the invitation.

782
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,360
 No matter who you are, regardless of your age,

783
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,080
 your giftings, your wiring,

784
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,320
 no matter what you bring to the table

785
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,160
 to put a stake in the ground tonight

786
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,960
 and say, God, I will do whatever you call me to do,

787
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,320
 no matter what it costs,

788
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,520
 to get the gospel to people who have never heard it.

789
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,440
 So will you bow your heads with me?

790
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,840
 (gentle music)

791
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,040
 I invite you to bow your heads and close your eyes.

792
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,160
 I really wanna challenge you

793
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,800
 to keep your eyes closed during this time.

794
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,720
 Like this invitation is not about anybody else

795
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,200
 but you and God.

796
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,560
 It's not about seeing what anybody else does.

797
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,520
 It's sure not about letting the way they respond

798
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,960
 affect the way you respond.

799
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,000
 Like as best as I can,

800
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,120
 I just wanna help you look to God alone right now.

801
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,320
 In this room and all those other gatherings.

802
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:11,120
 Just see the one who's speaking to your heart,

803
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,440
 tune everyone else out.

804
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,960
 And in just a minute, I'm gonna ask you to stand

805
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,120
 if you would say,

806
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,880
 God, I will do whatever you call me to do,

807
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,760
 no matter what it costs,

808
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,920
 to get the gospel to people who have never heard it.

809
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,320
 And really, I only wanna encourage you to stand

810
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,080
 if you're willing to put a stake in the ground tonight

811
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,320
 and say that before God.

812
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,160
 And some of you, for a host of reasons,

813
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,600
 are not at a point where you're ready to say that.

814
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,480
 Please don't treat this lightly.

815
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,880
 At the same time, others of you

816
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,200
 may have said something like this in the past.

817
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,240
 I want you to feel free to stand and say in a fresh way,

818
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,240
 that stake's still in the ground in my life.

819
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,400
 Here I am, God, whatever you call me to do.

820
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,440
 Obviously, I'm not saying you gotta have it figured out.

821
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,720
 What's gonna flow from this?

822
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,080
 That's the point.

823
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,280
 It's no strings attached.

824
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,560
 Whatever flows from this.

825
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,160
 That you alone know what's going on in your heart,

826
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,160
 your life right now.

827
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,920
 Just pray and God will awaken a church

828
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,200
 to say we're gonna do whatever God calls us to do

829
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,320
 to get the gospel to people who've never heard it.

830
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,120
 And tonight is an opportunity

831
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,760
 for some of you to join in that.

832
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,960
 So God, I pray.

833
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,620
 I pray that you would help every person

834
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:35,620
 in this gathering to respond with honest authenticity

835
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:42,420
 and humble courage in this moment.

836
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,360
 Whether that means standing or sitting.

837
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:51,720
 So right now, before God, just you and God.

838
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:57,120
 If you would say, God, I will do whatever you call me to do,

839
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,220
 no matter what it costs, to get the gospel

840
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,820
 to people who've never heard it.

841
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:07,060
 Would you just quietly stand up where you are?

842
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,220
 Just you before God.

843
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,800
 (gentle music)

844
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:33,200
 Oh God,

845
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 before you, I pray that you would be pleased

846
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,480
 and glorified

847
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:52,840
 and surrender if brothers and sisters

848
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,740
 all across this gathering and trust in different places.

849
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:02,960
 God, I pray for them.

850
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 I pray that you would give them deeper

851
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,400
 and deeper and deeper knowledge of understanding

852
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:20,200
 of your great glory and their great need

853
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:26,920
 for your grace in their lives

854
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,240
 and the nation's great need for your grace in their lives.

855
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,400
 God, that you would grip them with an urgency

856
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,280
 that says, I got a mist, I got a few years here

857
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,640
 on this earth to live for the glory of my God.

858
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,240
 I wanna make this mist count.

859
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,440
 It's like a vapor here one second, gone the next.

860
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,760
 God, I pray that you would lead, guide,

861
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,400
 direct their steps in the days ahead

862
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:02,160
 to however, wherever they can most faithfully make disciples

863
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,920
 who make disciples of the nations.

864
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,920
 Whether that's staying in Dallas the rest of their lives,

865
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,720
 according to the leadership of your spirit, if that's so,

866
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,520
 praying and giving and going as they have opportunity

867
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,600
 and being a part of getting behind work and the red,

868
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,400
 living, God, I pray that you would deliver them,

869
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,480
 give them holy discontentment with casual,

870
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,000
 comfortable, cultural Christianity.

871
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,200
 May they not settle for it.

872
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,000
 May they leave it behind in any way

873
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,680
 and the battle against it, may they live

874
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,360
 in all that obedience to you using time,

875
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,800
 treasure, talents for your glory among the nations.

876
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,440
 God, I pray that trust, you're gonna send some of them out

877
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,360
 to move to places in the red.

878
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,200
 You're gonna open doors for nurses and doctors

879
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,400
 and engineers and teachers and lawyers and business leaders

880
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,400
 and all kinds of people to go in all kinds of different ways

881
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,000
 and God, I pray, we pray tonight

882
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,880
 that there would be people in the red

883
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,600
 who hear the gospel for the first time

884
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,520
 from lips in this room, from feet,

885
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,040
 bringing the good news to them.

886
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,960
 God, we ask that boldly before you,

887
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,960
 would you cause unreached people to be reached

888
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,080
 because of what you are doing by your spirit

889
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,320
 in this place tonight?

890
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:27,400
 God, I pray that you would give them increasing faith.

891
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,880
 If we can trust you to save us

892
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,520
 for the next 10 trillion years,

893
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,840
 we say we can trust you to lead us on this earth

894
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,280
 and not be afraid of what you might lead us to do.

895
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,760
 And God, I pray, I pray that over those who are sitting

896
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,240
 for any number of reasons, God, I pray for anyone

897
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,920
 who's yet to put their faith in Jesus.

898
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,680
 God, I pray that they would feel right now

899
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:53,160
 your love for them, that you would draw them

900
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,960
 to your love for them in Jesus.

901
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,200
 You'd grant them a heart of humility to trust in you.

902
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,920
 God, others who are for any number of reasons,

903
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,040
 holding onto this, concerned about that,

904
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,000
 just not ready to say this, God, I pray,

905
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,800
 I do pray that you would draw them into faith

906
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,920
 with every facet of their lives in you.

907
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,800
 An awareness of the beauty of this gospel,

908
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,080
 not just for them, but for the nations.

909
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,480
 And that you would just work in their heart,

910
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,760
 however is best to draw them to yourself

911
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,120
 and into your mission in the days to come.

912
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,280
 God, we praise you that we are among those

913
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,880
 who have been reached by the gospel.

914
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,560
 Why were we not born in the red, living in the red?

915
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,680
 We had nothing to do with where we were born.

916
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,480
 This is only your mercy that we're in this room,

917
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,320
 in this gathering, right?

918
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,000
 We praise you for your mercy,

919
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,560
 and we pray that your grace toward us

920
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,880
 would be the great effect for your glory through us

921
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,960
 among the nations.

922
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,120
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

923
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,920
 Can I invite everybody to stand?

924
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:15,880
 We're gonna sing a song of praise,

925
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,960
 honor and glory.

926
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:25,200
 Our God has invited us into this mission.

927
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,760
 Mission, at the same time I do,

928
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,440
 I think we have something to put on the screen

929
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,640
 that has a QR code, maybe.

930
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,200
 There it is.

931
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,200
 I would just say, for those of you in particular who stood,

932
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,800
 if there's, yeah, if you click on this QR code,

933
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,480
 it's just a simple page that says,

934
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,720
 all right, you stand, what's step number one?

935
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,680
 And what does that look like from here?

936
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,400
 And what does tomorrow look like?

937
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,960
 What does tonight look like?

938
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,240
 And so if you want to click on that QR code,

939
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,920
 just a way to kind of help put next steps to that.

940
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,760
 And I know there's all kinds of steps, Lord willing,

941
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,480
 that you can take in local church, this local church,

942
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,480
 or any local church that you're a part of.

943
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,440
 So let's praise the God who's worthy,

944
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,480
 not just of our glory, but worthy of the glory of all

945
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,040
 the nations of the earth.

946
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,640
 ♪ Oh Lord ♪
