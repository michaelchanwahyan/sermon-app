[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:20.780]   - I remember when we started this deal,
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.180]   we had this vision for young adults
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.540]   that you would trade in the American dream
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.480]   and whatever it is the enemy is tempting you with
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.760]   out there in the world in Dallas and Fort Worth
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.920]   and wherever you would gather and you would say,
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.080]   hey, I'm just gonna trade that for giving my life to Jesus.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.920]   I just have a little time here, you know, 20 years,
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.000]   30 years, 50 years, 60 years, 80 years, whatever it is.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.440]   And then I'm gonna be somewhere forever and ever and ever.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.120]   I pray that's with God forever and ever and ever
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.240]   looking back on the treasures that you were able
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.080]   to store there with him.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.200]   And there's this weird thing happening in Christendom today
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.440]   in the evangelical world today,
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.480]   where we began to trade our worship for the world
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.360]   and we come into the church and we begin to worship pastors.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.520]   And so there's this weird thing going on right now,
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.640]   the celebrity pastors, you know, that's just a weird thing.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.620]   If you've written a book or you speak in conferences,
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.680]   what happens is there's a temptation in Christians
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.600]   to worship a person rather than the creator.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.320]   And I will tell you, I'm not impressed.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.840]   There's a lot of terrible books on the bookshelf.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.560]   So I'm not impressed when someone writes a book
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.980]   or has a large following.
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.240]   There's lots of heretics that have a large followings.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.240]   I am unbelievably impressed when someone lives 69 years,
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.800]   most of which they walk faithfully with Jesus.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.360]   I am unbelievably impressed when the spirit of God
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.160]   calls someone into such a deep dependence on them
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.120]   that they would have 33 years of preaching
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.920]   from the pulpit without moral failure.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.140]   When their relationship with God marks their lives
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.680]   much more unseen than what is seen
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.920]   as we've recently talked about in Matthew.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.360]   And so for my limited time with Pastor John Piper,
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.200]   that is what I've seen.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.440]   That is the reputation that goes before him.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.240]   That is what I've heard from mutual friends.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.240]   And so would you guys celebrate with me
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.340]   that the Lord would share with us tonight, Pastor John Piper.
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.500]   (audience applauding)
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.500]   (audience cheering)
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:34.320]   - Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.200]   I say to the Lord, you are my Lord.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.880]   I have no good apart from you.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.240]   As for the saints in the land,
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.740]   they are the noble in whom is all my delight.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.960]   Those who choose another God multiply their sorrows.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.320]   Their libations of blood I will not pour out
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.040]   or take their names upon my lips.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.280]   The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.580]   You hold my lot.
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.320]   The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.180]   Indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.840]   I bless the Lord who gives me counsel.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.560]   In the night also my heart instructs me.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.240]   Because you are right at my right hand,
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.160]   I shall not be moved.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.320]   Therefore, my heart is glad and my soul rejoices
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.680]   and my whole body dwells secure.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.220]   For you do not give me up to shield
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.700]   or let your godly ones see the pit.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.520]   You show me the path of life.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.880]   In your presence is fullness of joy.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.640]   At your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.120]   So if you have a Bible or a phone with a Bible on it
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.420]   or an iPad with a Bible on it,
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.420]   I want you to open it to Psalm 16, which I just recited.
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.120]   We'll have some of it on the screen up here,
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.320]   but if you can follow it on your own,
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.920]   I think it will make more of an impact
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.440]   because we're gonna look at this Psalm
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.060]   in great detail for the next hour.
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.880]   Let me set the table for you before I pray
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.300]   and ask God to come and do mighty things among us.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.240]   And the reason I feel an anticipation
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.700]   that he's going to do remarkable things
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.680]   is because the way he has set up this evening.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.840]   So two weeks ago, I was in the Boundary Waters
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.680]   in Northern Minnesota fishing with my son
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.320]   and six others.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.280]   And one of those others was a 20-year colleague
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.840]   whom I love, who has been the worship leader
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.280]   at our church for 20 years.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.880]   And when we got back to the Outfitters,
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.480]   he was to call home and the phone call
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.480]   was that his son had died at 22
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.460]   without the slightest history of trouble.
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.380]   He was in Northern Ireland doing a mission trip
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.420]   and simply fell over.
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.100]   And with his sister at his side, met Jesus.
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.440]   The funeral was last Friday, four days ago.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.580]   And little did we know that Alex,
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.140]   before he had left for Northern Ireland,
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.960]   had told his small group what he wanted in his funeral.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.020]   He didn't think he was going to die,
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.840]   but he said, "Here are the songs."
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.400]   We sang all the songs that he chose.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.740]   And here's the text that I want, Psalm 16.
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.680]   That's the psalm that I was asked to speak on months ago
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.280]   at this event.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.160]   And so last Friday, in front of about 1,000 young people,
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.520]   mainly, I was doing what I just did,
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.480]   praying over these people, Psalm 16.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.600]   And now I'm here speaking to several thousand people,
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.020]   not too much older probably than Alex.
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.120]   Psalm 16.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.120]   And in my judgment, God is setting that up
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.000]   to burden me for you in a way that he wouldn't
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.240]   or couldn't any other way.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.240]   You have no idea whether you will live out this week.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.320]   None.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.480]   He had no history whatsoever.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.240]   And to this moment, we do not know why he died.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.920]   Let's pray.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.900]   So Lord, I believe this is a divine appointment for many.
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.300]   Whether it be the case that some here
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.160]   will not live out the week
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.400]   or whether they will live 60 more years.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.480]   It's a divine appointment and the weight I feel
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.420]   for this psalm to come to reality in their lives
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.440]   is very great.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.320]   And so I invite you, Holy Spirit, to come.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.040]   In the name of Jesus, I plead with you to come.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.860]   Don't leave me to my resources.
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:24.640]   I look away from myself and I ask that these friends
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.600]   would do the same.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.240]   May they look away from themselves
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.240]   and all their performances and look wholly to you
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.160]   to speak to them now.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:44.100]   So that what David is and sees in this psalm,
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:49.080]   they would be and see and feel.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.600]   I ask this in Jesus' powerful name, amen.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.560]   Let me give you the main point as I understand it
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.240]   in one sentence.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.880]   So I'm gonna try to sum up the main point
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.360]   of all 11 verses in one sentence.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.300]   It goes like this.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:14.300]   God will bring you body and soul
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:22.360]   through life and death into full and everlasting pleasure
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   if God is your safest refuge and your sovereign Lord
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:39.920]   and your supreme treasure and your trusted counselor.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.200]   I know it's a long sentence.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.640]   So I'm gonna say it again and then we're gonna move
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.300]   through the entire psalm verse by verse
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.880]   and you will watch for whether I'm right
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.480]   to sum it up this way.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.320]   Goes like this.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.320]   God will bring you body and soul
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:13.640]   through life and death into full and everlasting pleasure
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.200]   if God is for you your safest refuge,
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:33.260]   your supreme treasure, your sovereign Lord
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:38.900]   and your trusted counselor.
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:45.260]   And so if he's not, my prayer is that as God speaks
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.420]   through this psalm, he would become that for you.
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:54.420]   A few of you who really know your Bible well
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:10:01.560]   might hear that summary in one sentence and say to me,
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.080]   are you going to take into account
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:12.860]   what the apostle Peter over in Acts chapter two
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.220]   in the New Testament makes of this psalm?
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.720]   Because Peter says that verses nine to 11
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:30.080]   are a prophecy of the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:37.780]   Hey, you didn't mention that in your main point.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.120]   Why not?
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.200]   'Cause that's the one thing he picked out of the psalm
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.020]   to mention.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.840]   And my answer is number one, yes, I am going to deal
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:56.400]   with what Peter makes of this psalm in Acts two.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.000]   And number two, the reason I don't say
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.900]   that the resurrection of Jesus is part of the main point
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.780]   of this psalm is because I don't think it is.
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:14.280]   But rather is a massive and unshakable,
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.040]   argument for the main point of the psalm.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:23.360]   And if that sounds strange to you,
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.740]   that something is massive and unshakable and great
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.040]   and glorious as the resurrection of the son of God
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:37.040]   from the dead should be an argument under a main point,
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.120]   supporting it, just know this,
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.680]   that one of the great and amazing
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.200]   and wonderful things about the Bible
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.720]   is that again and again and again,
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:59.400]   glorious things, massive, unshakable, beautiful,
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.920]   awesome realities are made to serve practical,
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.960]   personal main points in texts.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.520]   That's amazing and that's true all over the Bible.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:19.720]   So yes, we will get to Peter's application
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.760]   of verses nine to 11 in the resurrection
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.200]   and we will discover it is not the main point of this text.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:33.560]   The main point of this text is that God will bring you
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:39.120]   body and soul through death into full
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.400]   and everlasting pleasure if he is your treasure
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:48.600]   and refuge and sovereign and counselor.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.320]   That's the main point.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.600]   So let's try to think David's thoughts after him now.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.280]   My goal when I read the Bible
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.880]   and when I interpret the Bible
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.240]   is simply to try to get inside the head
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.400]   and especially in the Psalms,
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.920]   get inside the heart of the writers
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.680]   and think the way they think.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.920]   Follow their reasoning,
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.480]   have emotions that correspond to their emotions
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.480]   as they are seeing truth and responding to it
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.480]   with a spirit inspired power and guidance.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:31.440]   This Psalm begins verse one with David's petition
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.720]   and that's an important word.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.720]   This is a petition, a request, a prayer, a plea.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.440]   Preserve me, oh God.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.160]   That's a prayer, right?
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.760]   God, preserve me.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.760]   Now you don't know yet from what or for what.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:02.040]   All you know is this Psalm begins, save me,
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.720]   preserve me, protect me, keep me.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.520]   And you have to just suspend judgment for a few minutes.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.120]   We will see it from what?
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.560]   What are you worried about?
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:25.560]   Preserve me, oh God is the way he begins
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.520]   and that petition colors everything in this Psalm
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.560]   as we will see.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.560]   And now he moves forward.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.760]   What does he do in moving forward?
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:41.760]   He begins declaring and exalting in what God is for him.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:49.520]   And he does that for seven verses.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:54.520]   He declares and he exalts in what God is for him
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:59.440]   and the effect that has on his petition
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.120]   by the time he gets to verse eight is stunning.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.360]   It's amazing.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.360]   So let's follow him as he does this.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.720]   Verse one, preserve me, oh God,
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:18.680]   for in you I take refuge.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:26.640]   Because I take refuge in you, preserve me.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.320]   I take refuge in you, therefore preserve me.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.960]   So you see the way the two,
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:38.080]   the declaration, you are my refuge.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.960]   He is hoping with all his might
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.960]   will have an effect on God to incline God to preserve him.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.680]   That's what for means, right?
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.520]   Preserve me for, preserve me because.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.000]   I'm taking refuge in you.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.200]   So you see me taking refuge in you
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.200]   as my safe place and you will therefore preserve me.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.320]   Will you not God?
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.760]   So the first thing he does is declare
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.480]   and exalt in God as his refuge, a safe place.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.680]   So I'm turning to you.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.040]   I'm not turning to other places for safety.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.640]   You are my safest place.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.960]   Verse two, I say to the Lord, all caps, Yahweh.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:38.080]   Whenever you see all caps, Lord in the Bible,
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.120]   it's because behind it is the Hebrew proper name
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.720]   for God, Yahweh.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:49.840]   I say to Yahweh, God, you are my, small cap,
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.400]   small letters, Lord, Adonai.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.560]   Yahweh, you are my, Adonai.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.560]   Yahweh, you are my Lord, my master, my sovereign.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.120]   That's what he's saying.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.800]   The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.800]   the God of the Exodus is his master, his sovereign
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.600]   and he exalts in it.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.280]   He doesn't just state it as a doctrinal fact.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.780]   God is sovereign over me.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.040]   You are my sovereign, my Lord, my master.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.400]   I exalt in you as my sovereign.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:33.400]   So now we have, you're my refuge and you're my sovereign.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:39.000]   Verse two, middle of the verse, second half of the verse,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.640]   I have no good apart from you.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:49.920]   God is his highest good or my language,
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.560]   God is his supreme treasure.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:59.320]   All other goods in life are good because of God.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:04.200]   God is his supreme treasure over everything
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.060]   and in everything.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:11.760]   I have no good unless you're in it.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.200]   I have no good apart from you.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.640]   You are my good, my ultimate treasure.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.440]   So now we have God as his refuge
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.000]   and we have God as his sovereign
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.960]   and we have God as his treasure.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:33.840]   He's exalting in what God is for him as he moves forward.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:39.780]   Verse four, verse three, he underlines now
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:44.780]   and emphasizes this supreme value that God has
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:49.240]   by saying what it is about people that makes him glad.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:55.120]   See, I'm gonna underline how precious you are to me, God,
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.280]   how you're my only and highest good,
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.260]   no good except when you're in it.
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.560]   I'm gonna do this by talking about how I relate to people,
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.100]   what makes me happy and glad about people.
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:11.640]   And so he says, as for the saints in the land,
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.540]   that is, holy ones, godly ones,
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.760]   the ones who treasure God and live for him.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.620]   As for the saints in the land,
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:22.620]   they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight,
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:32.480]   all my pleasure, all my joy,
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.940]   which does not mean that he delights in the saints,
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:41.400]   the godly ones, instead of God or above God,
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.340]   but because of God.
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.240]   In other words, as he contemplates
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.040]   all the kinds of people in the world,
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.840]   all the worldly people, all the powerful people,
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.360]   all the influential people,
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.580]   all the people that could scratch his back,
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.160]   he says, there's one kind of people
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.480]   that make me really, really glad,
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.040]   people that treasure God.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:15.280]   And I wonder if you're sitting there thinking,
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:21.000]   I don't like the Christians I know,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.920]   and I have more fun with all my unbelieving friends.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:37.160]   If that's you, I think you should ask two questions.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.800]   One, do you know any Christians?
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:46.520]   I mean, Christians?
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.320]   I don't mean churchgoers.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:55.880]   I mean radical people who lay their lives down
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.880]   because Jesus means everything to them.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.300]   They are servants of the world
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.820]   because Jesus has moved into their lives,
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.120]   turned everything upside down,
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.440]   broken them free from their love affair with the world
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.440]   and their ego and power and money and sex
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.120]   and they're radical people.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.800]   You don't know anybody?
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.680]   Maybe you don't know anybody like that to dislike.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.440]   That's the first question you should ask.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.560]   The second question you should ask is,
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:32.360]   why would it be that you, a professing Christian,
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:40.480]   would find more joy in people
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:46.560]   who find no joy in what is your primary joy?
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.160]   [audience laughing]
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.060]   What would that mean?
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:57.200]   Those are the two questions you should ask.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.640]   Verse four, he underlines again
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.460]   his radical preference for God over all things.
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:13.400]   "The sorrows of those who run after another God
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.200]   "shall multiply.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.300]   "Their drink offerings of blood I will not pour out
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.880]   "or take their names upon my lips."
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.280]   In other words, I am so totally satisfied in God,
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.360]   I am so totally sold out to God,
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.160]   so totally in love with God,
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.160]   so totally there beside God is my pleasure.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:41.340]   If another God comes along and offers me anything,
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.680]   not only will I not pour out any libations
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.000]   of worship to this God,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.320]   I won't even take his name on my lips.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.380]   I will not give him the honor of naming him
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.120]   because how much folly is there
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.400]   in turning away from the fountain of living waters
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.640]   to embrace a God who leaves you only
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.280]   with sorrows in the end?
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:08.640]   They multiply their sorrows who go after other gods.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.680]   I will have none of it.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.040]   I have found the fountain of living waters.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.680]   I will not turn away.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.580]   So this is another way of underlining
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:22.360]   how supreme the treasure of God is to him.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.800]   Verse five, first half of the verse,
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.240]   he returns, he's gonna start repeating now.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.080]   He returns to the level of chapter two,
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.240]   I mean verse two, second half of the verse.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.840]   He had said, "I have no good apart from you."
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.600]   And here he says, "The Lord is my chosen portion
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.520]   "in my cup."
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.300]   So back there in verse two, he had said,
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.960]   "I have no good apart from you."
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.180]   And here in verse five, he says,
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.360]   "The Lord is my chosen portion in my cup."
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.400]   So there's a table spread in front of him, as it were.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:02.040]   With delectable, hundreds of delectable portions.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.180]   And cups filled with the finest wine.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:12.000]   And he looks and says, "There he is, God."
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.240]   And this cup, God.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.560]   God is my chosen portion and my cup.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.180]   You can spread before me all the portions
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.060]   you want in this world.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.680]   You can spread all the cups with every imaginable taste
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.680]   in this world.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:31.680]   I choose God as my portion and my cup overflowing is God.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.280]   Which is just another way of saying,
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.480]   he's my highest treasure.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.820]   He's my supreme good.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.960]   Second half of verse five.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.800]   "I say to the Lord," this is what he had said
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:53.800]   back in verse two, "I say to the Lord, you are my Lord."
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.880]   Here, he says it in another way.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.880]   In the second half of verse five, "You hold my lot."
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:07.520]   You hold my lot.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.480]   What does that mean?
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.600]   It means when the dice are rolled
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.880]   and the straws are drawn
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:22.040]   and the wheel is spun,
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:28.080]   what happens to me, God decided would happen.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:33.400]   You hold my lot.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:41.920]   And so my main point includes
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:46.240]   if you embrace him as your sovereign Lord.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:50.500]   Verse six.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.960]   He exalts him what this means for him.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.640]   If God is that sovereign, that he holds the dice,
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.480]   he holds the straws, he holds the wheel,
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.600]   he holds everything and determines what lot I draw.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.880]   What does that mean for him?
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.500]   It means this, the lines have fallen for me
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.840]   in pleasant places.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.180]   Indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.820]   Now here we gotta do some hard thinking.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.680]   What kind of lines are you talking about?
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.840]   Lines, lines, lines have fallen for me.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.840]   What lines, like fishing lines or clothes lines or,
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.840]   no, border lines, border lines, boundary lines.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.600]   The lines have fallen for me to enclose me
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.840]   in pleasant places.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.100]   Yes, in there I have a beautiful inheritance.
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.680]   Here's the catch.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.840]   Probably when you read that,
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.840]   you might think of places as geography in Palestine
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.820]   where he lived.
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:02.240]   And you might think of the inheritance as the land.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.800]   Here's the, it might include that.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.800]   But here's the problem with that.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.800]   The Hebrew word translated pleasant places
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.400]   is the same single word in verse 11
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.620]   translated pleasures.
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:28.720]   In your presence are pleasures forevermore.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.800]   And so a natural way,
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.540]   if you wanted to keep the translation consistent,
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.720]   would be to say in verse six,
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.060]   the lines have fallen for me in pleasures.
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.400]   And if you said what pleasures?
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.000]   Well, it would be the pleasures of verse 11.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.600]   At your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:55.500]   And the border lines around me are God's,
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.360]   you hold my lot.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.880]   You define for me the borders that hedge me into God
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.880]   as my pleasure.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.920]   Just like verse 11 is going to say.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:12.560]   I doubt therefore that he's talking about real estate here.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.880]   I got no problem with God being good enough
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.960]   to give you a home.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.320]   Provide you maybe even from your parents
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.560]   an inheritance of a parcel of land.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.120]   Wonderful, amen.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.160]   I just don't think that's what he's talking about here.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:33.860]   I think he's saying, since God holds my lot,
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:37.060]   the thing he does that is greatest
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.900]   with his sovereignty for me
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:43.000]   is that he circumscribes with these boundary lines.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.320]   He circumscribes my life and he pushes me
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.360]   into the center where there is fullness of joy,
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.360]   namely God himself.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:57.200]   That's my understanding of verse six.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.960]   And therefore, there's not much difference
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.640]   between the sovereignty of God and exalting in it
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:10.640]   and the supreme treasure of God and exalting in it
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.240]   because God says here, I hold your lot,
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:18.240]   the lines have fallen for you in pleasures that are me.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.040]   Therefore God's sovereignty for me means
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.300]   I make myself your treasure.
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.880]   With all my might and my sovereign power,
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.540]   I make myself your treasure.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:33.280]   So my enjoyment of the sovereignty of God
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.520]   is that it is exerted mightily on my behalf
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.520]   to make sure God stays my treasure, my pleasure.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:53.000]   He is our treasure.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.320]   And now we're going to see that he is our counselor.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:05.960]   Verse seven, he goes one step further
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.180]   in exalting in what God is for him.
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:13.600]   God is not only refuge, treasure, sovereign,
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.880]   but now he's counselor.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.840]   I bless the Lord who gives me counsel.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.540]   In the night also my heart instructs me.
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.900]   Now that's not a small add-on.
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:29.600]   And the reason I say it's not a small or insignificant add-on
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:34.600]   to refuge, sovereign, and treasure
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.800]   is because trusting God as your counselor
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:48.600]   affects how you experience God as your refuge
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.840]   and as your treasure and as your sovereign.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.840]   Let me just illustrate what I mean by that.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:00.840]   God is a refuge in part by the way he counsels us.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.480]   In part by the way he counsels us.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:11.440]   God's being a refuge for you is not automatic.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.700]   It's not mechanical.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:16.640]   It's not like you pay zero attention
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.340]   to his word and his counsel,
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:22.240]   and you simply find yourself safe.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.120]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.880]   If you find yourself in danger,
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.080]   danger of harm, danger of a sin,
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.640]   danger of some absolutely foolish way of life,
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.440]   and God comes to you with his counsel,
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:41.920]   he's telling you how to find refuge.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.760]   Don't go there.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.000]   Don't do that.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   So his counsel is the means of his becoming refuge for you.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.680]   This is dynamic.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.960]   This is interactive.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:58.080]   God's word are his counsels to us,
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.600]   and his word is the path of life, not death,
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.080]   the path of safety, not destruction,
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.880]   and therefore he's becoming a refuge for us
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.000]   all the time as he speaks to us.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.380]   Or treasure.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.800]   How does his being a treasure for us
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.880]   relate to his being a counselor for us?
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:24.240]   Well, because you don't only treasure God
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.800]   because of his character,
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:32.840]   righteous and just and true and gracious and loving
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:38.360]   and wise, you also treasure him
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:41.600]   because of his teachings, his words.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.520]   Remember the soldiers who came back and they said,
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.000]   "Why didn't you bring Jesus?"
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.700]   And the soldiers said, "Nobody speaks like this man."
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.600]   His disciples were constantly jaw-dropping
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.640]   at the kinds of things he said.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:01.520]   His counsels were stunningly satisfying and beautiful.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.280]   So he's our treasure, not only in the way he is,
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.800]   but the way he talks to us.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.280]   And so being our counselor intersects
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.680]   with his being our treasure.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.800]   And the same thing is true about his sovereignty.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.760]   God is sovereign over you.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.800]   Sometimes in spite of you,
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:30.120]   just cuts you off at some stupid direction you're going
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.460]   and you didn't approve of it at all and he rescues you.
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:39.720]   Other times he exercises his authority and sovereignty
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.240]   through his counsel to you.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:49.720]   God uses means as well as acting sovereignly
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.920]   apart from means.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:58.920]   So the first seven verses are first,
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.960]   "Preserve me, O God, preserve me, O God,
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.480]   "for in you I take refuge.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.960]   "Preserve me, O God."
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:09.960]   And then four declarations and exaltations.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:14.460]   You're my refuge, my safe place.
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:18.940]   You're my sovereign, my Lord, you hold my lot
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:22.640]   and you are my treasure supreme.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.120]   I have no good apart from you and you're my counselor.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:34.440]   Now, what in the flow of that worship
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:39.000]   happens to his petition?
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   When you get to verse eight.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.200]   "I have set the Lord always before me."
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.600]   That's what he's been doing.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:54.040]   "Because he is at my right hand, this refuge,
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.240]   "this sovereign, this treasure, this counselor,
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:01.240]   "because he's at my right hand, I shall not be shaken."
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.540]   That's not a request anymore.
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:08.600]   That's an affirmation.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.840]   So the way I understand verses one through eight
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:18.360]   is that what begins as an aching longing,
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:23.360]   "Preserve me, O God," ends with, "I will not be shaken.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.760]   "I will be preserved.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.380]   "I will be kept.
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.100]   "He will not let me be lost."
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:35.100]   And the pathway from the petition, aching and longing,
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.820]   to the assertion and the affirmation and the confidence
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:43.740]   is heralding and exalting in what God is for us.
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:48.740]   And I would simply commend to you that way of praying.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:54.140]   Because almost all my beginnings in prayer
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:55.660]   begin the way his does.
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:00.140]   I seldom begin a worship service
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:04.380]   or a time of prayer in solitude red hot for God.
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.820]   Totally confident, this is gonna go well.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.740]   This day, he's in charge.
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:09.580]   It's gonna go right.
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.120]   He'll give me his guidance.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.500]   My prayers don't begin that way.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.940]   They begin, "Help!"
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.420]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.820]   Which is the way he began, right?
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.660]   "Preserve me, O God."
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:20.600]   And then what do you do?
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.520]   You stop and wait for a confidence to happen?
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.380]   You do what he did.
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.820]   You do what he did.
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.060]   You declare, you can do it alone,
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.380]   you can do it in a small group,
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:33.620]   you can do it as you sing.
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:37.300]   You declare what he is for you.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.860]   And you exalt in what he is for you.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.020]   And after you do that through safe refuge
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.380]   and highest treasure and sovereign Lord
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:51.040]   and trusted counselor, confidence is rising.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:56.380]   That's the way the Psalm flows, it seems to me.
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:02.900]   Now, on the basis of that confidence,
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.060]   we arrive in verse nine
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:08.180]   as the great high point of the argument,
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.740]   the therefore of joy.
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:17.820]   Therefore, verse nine, therefore.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.380]   Let me just, make sure you see this.
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.740]   I'm gonna draw it for you in the air, all right?
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.220]   This is the way I think.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:27.900]   Here's the petition.
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:34.620]   Here is him rising in exaltation
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:36.380]   in what God is for him.
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.300]   And here is, I'm confident.
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.180]   I will not be shaken, verse eight.
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:46.760]   So help me, you are my God in all these ways.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.100]   I am confident, therefore.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.500]   Whenever you see a therefore, it's going up a level.
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.620]   So here's a level, here's a level,
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.300]   and you've got this little post here.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.580]   You can draw the little legs on the post if you want to,
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.820]   like this, and this is a pillar holding up a great truth.
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:07.820]   And the truth is, my heart is glad.
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.300]   My heart is glad.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:14.660]   My whole being rejoices.
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.740]   And so joy, so far, we've got nine verses,
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:22.740]   and the argument has built up to the top level here of joy.
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:30.020]   So the petition leads to the exaltation
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.420]   in what God is for him,
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.620]   which leads to confidence that he will not be shaken,
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:39.420]   which leads to pervasive and deep joy.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:42.460]   And now we are at the point
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.960]   where we're gonna get the answer to the question,
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:50.820]   what was he seeking preservation from?
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:59.900]   Because this joy here in verse nine,
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:04.780]   verse nine, is not only supported,
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:06.980]   okay, here we are back at my drawing, watch.
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:12.820]   It's this top level of joy is not only being supported
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:16.260]   by this massive confidence that I will not be shaken,
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.940]   and my petition has become a confidence.
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.380]   I will be preserved, I will not be shaken,
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.500]   therefore I'm happy.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.780]   Notice the little word that begins verse 10.
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.820]   Somebody just shout it out, read it.
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.020]   For, am I right?
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:47.340]   You will not let me be handed over.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:52.660]   My flesh dwells secure, safe,
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.340]   for you will not abandon my soul to shield,
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:00.100]   for, because you will not abandon my soul to shield,
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.220]   or let your godly ones see corruption,
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:05.360]   that is, I will not dissolve in the grave,
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.820]   you make known to me the path of life.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.440]   So on this side of the platform of joy,
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.420]   you come down with a for.
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.980]   You got a therefore over here,
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.480]   confident, will not be shaken,
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:22.380]   therefore, joy, because,
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:25.700]   because you will not abandon my soul to shield,
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:29.140]   or let your holy ones see corruption.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.500]   Now here's what this says to me.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.260]   I wanna know, David, what you were talking about
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.660]   back at the beginning when you said, preserve me.
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.340]   I wanna know in what sense you will not be shaken.
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.860]   What were you concerned most about here?
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:43.540]   And I think verse 10 tells us.
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.400]   I don't wanna die.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:51.980]   I don't want to be dissolved.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:55.380]   I don't want for death to end at all.
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:01.380]   And his joy in verse nine is based
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:05.740]   on the confidence on the one side
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:06.860]   that he will not be shaken,
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.780]   and that is spelled out on the other side
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.100]   with the because clause of verse 10,
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.240]   because you won't abandon my soul to shield.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:18.960]   You won't let your holy ones see corruption.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.380]   You will make known to me the path of life.
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.480]   That's what he was concerned about in verse one.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.540]   Preserve me, oh God, from death.
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.260]   Don't give me up to death.
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.620]   Don't let me be shaken out of the land of the living.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.180]   I want to live.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.900]   I want to live forever.
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.360]   I love you.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.500]   You're my refuge.
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.380]   You're my treasure.
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.920]   You're my sovereign.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.420]   You're everything to me, my counselor.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.980]   And I want that to be true forever.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.220]   I don't want to perish.
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:59.320]   I won't be shaken.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:04.180]   And therefore, I am glad because,
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.980]   because you won't abandon my soul to shield.
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:13.300]   You won't let your godly ones see corruption.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.980]   So he is absolutely sure
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:21.500]   that he will not be destroyed by death.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:24.300]   It says in Psalm 49, 15,
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:28.020]   God will ransom my soul from the power of shield
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.780]   for he will receive me.
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.100]   Or Psalm 73, 24,
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.660]   you guide me with your counsel.
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:37.220]   Afterward, you will receive me to glory.
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:42.620]   So because God is his portion here as refuge
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.220]   and sovereign and treasure and counselor,
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:49.220]   God's going to be his portion in all those ways forever.
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:52.540]   David is confident that that's the case.
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.480]   So let me state my main point again.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.880]   See, if you agree,
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:01.820]   God will bring you body and soul,
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:03.980]   body and soul,
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.120]   my flesh dwells secure.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.380]   You will not let me see corruption.
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:13.780]   God will bring you body and soul
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.220]   through life and death, through life, through death,
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.660]   into full and everlasting joy.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.620]   Verse 11, in your presence is fullness of joy.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.420]   At your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.740]   God will bring you into full and lasting pleasure
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:30.580]   if God is your safest refuge,
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.900]   your highest and most supreme treasure,
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.700]   your sovereign Lord and your trusted counselor.
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.220]   I think that's the main point of the Psalm.
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:49.440]   And of course, we have left out Peter in Acts 2.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:58.060]   Now, I don't want to run to Acts 2
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:00.700]   and lay it on this Psalm
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.700]   before I let David have a chance here.
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:08.060]   I think sometimes we do that.
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:13.260]   We say, okay, the New Testament gives the key
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.260]   to unlock the deeper meaning of the Old Testament,
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.540]   which it certainly does,
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:21.260]   and we take the key and we fling open the door
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.460]   before we even look in the room,
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.740]   before we even look at the door,
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:26.180]   before we look at the lock,
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:31.100]   before we let David have his whole say.
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.860]   This is what I've been trying to do.
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:37.660]   Nathan, the prophet, came to David
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:42.300]   in 2 Samuel 7, verse 12, and he said this.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:47.780]   "When your days are fulfilled
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:51.420]   and you lie down with your fathers,"
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:56.540]   this is the prophet talking, it's not opinion.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:01.540]   "David knew he would lie down with his fathers
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:05.500]   and face decay."
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:06.860]   He knew that.
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.980]   "It was told him by God,
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:15.540]   you will die and lie there,
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:19.020]   just like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob.
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:22.780]   "When your days are fulfilled
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:25.700]   and you lie down with your fathers,
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:30.260]   I will raise up for you offspring after you
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.180]   who will come from your body
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:37.380]   and I will establish his kingdom.
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:41.820]   He shall build a house for my name
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:46.820]   and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever."
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:54.700]   So David knew that he would die,
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.500]   that he would lie in the grave like his fathers,
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.540]   but that God would set one of his descendants
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.660]   upon his throne and this descendant
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:07.540]   would not be simply one of a succession of kings
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:08.900]   on the Davidic throne.
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:12.860]   He would end all succession
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:17.580]   because he and his throne will reign forever,
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:22.140]   which means somehow this king is going to triumph
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:25.060]   over this horrible enemy that has brought an end
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:26.820]   to every single king.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:30.780]   Death is not gonna have victory over him.
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.580]   It's not gonna have dominion over him.
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:37.580]   Somehow he is not going to be lying in the grave
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.140]   like I am with my fathers
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:44.380]   for decade and century after century.
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.340]   He knew that.
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:47.580]   He knew that was gonna happen.
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:52.100]   A Messiah, a king of kings, a king of David,
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.380]   a son of David would come.
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.580]   He knew this.
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.480]   You don't need anything in the New Testament to know that.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:02.940]   David knew this from prophetic truth,
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.900]   which is what makes the fulfillment
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.640]   in the New Testament so glorious.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:12.100]   David lived in the consciousness.
[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.060]   I will die down with my fathers.
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.740]   I will dissolve in the grave.
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.880]   One will come after me who will not suffer dissolution
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:19.720]   like me.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:20.540]   He will not decay.
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:22.060]   His throne will be forever.
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.540]   And so here's my question.
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.540]   What does verse 10 mean?
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:31.980]   In view of being aware of that, David is aware of that.
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:36.980]   And he writes this, "For you will not abandon my soul
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:41.300]   "to Sheol, the place of the dead,
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:47.260]   "or let your Holy One see the pit or to see corruption."
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:52.100]   What does he mean?
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:55.520]   He knows he's gonna see corruption.
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:04.620]   So Peter in Acts chapter two says this.
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:09.260]   This is his thinking.
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:12.700]   David did see corruption.
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:17.580]   He did see the pit of dissolution.
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:18.580]   He knew he would.
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:23.580]   And so verse 10 goes beyond what would come true for David.
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:29.420]   Goes beyond what would come true for him,
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:32.500]   even in the resurrection after he was dissolved,
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.740]   put back together in the resurrection of the dead
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:37.300]   at the end of the age, like the rest of us
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:38.640]   who are believers.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:42.180]   It went beyond that and said,
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:45.180]   you won't even see corruption.
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.300]   Now here are Peter's very words.
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.840]   This is Acts chapter two, verses 30 to 32.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:55.660]   And this tells you why I thought the way I thought.
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:49:00.660]   Being there for a prophet and knowing that God had sworn
[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:04.540]   with an oath to him that he would set one
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:07.180]   of his descendants on his throne,
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:12.740]   David foresaw and spoke about the resurrection
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:15.180]   of the Christ, the Messiah,
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:19.140]   that he was not abandoned to Hades,
[00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:22.900]   nor did his flesh see corruption.
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:26.580]   This Jesus, God raised up.
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:31.540]   And of that, we are all witnesses.
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:36.880]   So this Psalm,
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:44.180]   David begins with a petition, preserve me, oh God.
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:50.620]   It moves to an unshakable confidence in verse eight
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:52.540]   and part of verse nine where he says,
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:54.420]   my flesh will dwell secure.
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:50:00.060]   And yet David knew he would die.
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:03.900]   He knew he would also be rescued from death
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.780]   for eternal joys at God right hand.
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:08.980]   And he knew that there would be a Messiah
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:13.140]   who would not die the way he died, not lie in the grave.
[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.940]   And he knew that somehow that Messiah
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:19.460]   who would bring death to an end in the succession of kings,
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.380]   death would be no more.
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:24.380]   That event and his own experience of pleasures
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:27.140]   forevermore at God's right hand had to be related
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.300]   to each other and he didn't know how.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:35.660]   Peter, more clearly than anybody in the New Testament
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:36.500]   said it this way.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:41.180]   This is Peter's first letter, chapter one, verse 11.
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:46.140]   The prophets searched and inquired carefully,
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:50.700]   inquiring what person or time the spirit of Christ
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:53.180]   in them was indicating when they predicted
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:56.580]   the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories.
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:58.700]   But they didn't know.
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:06.060]   David saw through a glass so darkly, he didn't know.
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:09.220]   I'm gonna live forever somehow and yet I'm gonna die,
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.780]   I'm gonna rot in the grave and yet I'm gonna have joy
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.380]   at God's right hand forever.
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:16.420]   There's coming one after me who will be from my seed.
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.740]   He will not be just a succession of kings.
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:20.380]   He will stop the succession.
[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:22.140]   He will live forever, he will conquer.
[00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:26.300]   He will not be dissolved and they cannot be related.
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:30.300]   Somehow that relates to me because that happens.
[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:32.900]   This is gonna happen and I don't see it.
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:35.780]   And that's where it's left in the Old Testament.
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:39.900]   It was revealed to them, going on in first Peter,
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:43.540]   it was revealed to them that they were serving you
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:45.060]   who have been preached the gospel
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.820]   so that we on this side of the grave,
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:49.820]   we know how they fit together.
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:55.940]   We know that David and all those who trusted
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:59.100]   the promise of Christ and you and all of you
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:03.020]   who trust the person of Christ are united to Christ
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:05.700]   so that when Christ triumphed over death,
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:09.220]   you triumphed over death and you with David
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.580]   will not be left in Sheol,
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:13.980]   but you will enter into the path of life
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.540]   that leads to everlasting pleasures
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:19.420]   forever more at God's right hand.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:24.420]   We know that now that Jesus allowed himself,
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:28.660]   in fact, he chose to be swallowed up by death
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:33.660]   for sinners like us, but inside the belly of that fish,
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:39.220]   he poisoned it to death and it vomited him back out
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:44.660]   into life and death died because Christ poisoned it
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:48.940]   from the inside out so that everyone who is in Christ
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.660]   will not be destroyed by that monster,
[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:55.500]   but will be set free into everlasting life.
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:53:00.460]   That's what we know now more clearly than David knew,
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:02.740]   but oh, what he knew.
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:04.580]   So we're closing with this.
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:10.820]   If it's true, and I'll just read Romans 8, 11 here.
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:15.380]   If it's true, if the spirit of him who raised Jesus
[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:20.380]   from the dead dwells in you, you got that?
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:25.980]   If the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you,
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:32.100]   he who raised Jesus from the dead will give life
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:36.900]   to your mortal bodies also through the spirit
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:38.060]   who dwells in you.
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:44.740]   So here's your question in closing.
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:51.100]   What are the marks of the person who has the spirit
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:53.780]   that raised Jesus from the dead?
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:59.100]   Because if you are that person, you will rise from the dead
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:02.380]   and you can be the most radical human being in the world
[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:04.980]   because your death problem is over.
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:13.580]   My answer is the marks of the person
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:19.260]   who have the spirit of God is exactly the same today
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.900]   as it was in Psalm 16.
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:30.660]   Namely, God is your safest refuge.
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:36.800]   God is your supreme treasure.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:42.000]   God is your sovereign Lord.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.980]   And God is your trusted counselor.
[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:53.740]   And you now know that he will be forever
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:58.740]   because you hold fast to Jesus who by his death
[00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:03.560]   and resurrection made all of that possible.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:08.540]   Let's pray.
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:13.820]   So Father in heaven, I ask now that by the Holy Spirit
[00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:17.200]   who raised Jesus from the dead, you would come.
[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:24.740]   And as we sing one more time, the magnificent refrain
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:30.140]   of Psalm 16 that in your presence is fullness of joy
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:33.220]   at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:38.380]   You would grant every heart in this room
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:45.220]   to cleave to you as a refuge.
[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:48.740]   May they flee from every other refuge.
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:51.960]   May they hold fast to you as their highest good
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:56.620]   and their supreme treasure and turn from every other treasure
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:58.340]   as a competing God.
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:03.180]   May they hold fast to you as a God who holds their lot
[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:07.140]   and is their sovereign King and Lord.
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:13.300]   And may they fly to you even now as a trusted counselor
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:19.540]   who this very night will tell them by your word
[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:22.500]   what they should do for life.
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:27.780]   I ask this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:34.140]   - Jesus' brother James says, don't just listen to the word.
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:38.580]   He said, look deeply into it.
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:41.380]   And he said, you should look at it like a man
[00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:46.380]   who looks in a mirror and when he examines himself
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:50.040]   against the word of God, he sees something out of place
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:52.940]   that he would change it, that he would do what it says.
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:55.860]   This morning I was praying for you guys,
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:57:00.860]   reading in Jeremiah and the prophet Jeremiah just says,
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:03.220]   you've deceived yourself.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:07.500]   You haven't listened to the commands that the Lord
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.700]   of our God has laid before you.
[00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:13.300]   And then that kind of took me on a rabbit trail
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.660]   of really examining some terrifying scriptures.
[00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:20.020]   Matthew 25, verse 45 just says,
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:21.840]   whatever you have not done for the least of these,
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:22.740]   you have not done for me.
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:26.420]   And then Matthew 7, 22 and 23 says, depart from me.
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:28.540]   Though you say, Lord, Lord, I didn't know you.
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:32.860]   And then first Corinthians five says,
[00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:35.260]   with a man that participates in these things,
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:37.080]   don't even eat with such a brother.
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:39.760]   If he calls himself a brother, a Christian.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.680]   And then again in first Peter four,
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:49.700]   it just says, exhorting or admonishing rather,
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:55.500]   the one who says they have believed upon the gospel
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:58:00.160]   but does not follow through with what the gospel says.
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:03.880]   Then I thought about us here in Dallas
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:07.860]   and friends in Fort Worth and really young adults,
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.820]   20s and 30 somethings all over this world
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:12.740]   who have deceived themselves to believe
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:16.540]   they are followers of Jesus
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:18.340]   and yet they're not following Jesus.
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:22.020]   That they would cry out to the Lord and you, I take refuge.
[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:23.880]   And yet they have not taken refuge.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:28.200]   And I don't say that to scare you at all,
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:33.760]   except that the spirit of God might scare you.
[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:39.580]   And so I hope that you can take that into a relationship
[00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:43.100]   with him or at least have you examine yourself
[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:45.100]   against what he has put in front of us this evening.
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:46.740]   And so thank you Pastor John Piper
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:48.940]   for sharing from the word with us tonight.
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:52.440]   (congregation applauding)
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:57.140]   And what's gonna happen now
[00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:59.180]   is there's gonna be a bunch of people in red shirts
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:00.380]   that just say the porch on them
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:03.180]   and those are just ministers of the gospels.
[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:04.860]   They're gonna be here to pray or wanna talk to someone.
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.740]   They're here, up here is the easiest place to find them.
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:10.300]   They're at the welcome center, they're all out there.
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:12.120]   You can just go up to someone in a red shirt and just say,
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.820]   hey, can I talk to you about something
[00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:15.420]   to which they would take great delight in,
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:17.580]   having a conversation with you.
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:19.540]   If you're here and you're in search of deeper fellowship
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:21.820]   with other Christians, followers of Christ,
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:23.180]   you say, I look at my friends
[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:25.540]   and I can't delight in the people of the land
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:28.340]   because the people in the land don't know Christ.
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:31.340]   I don't know anyone that knows Jesus or walks with Jesus.
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:33.220]   If you're a guy and you walk down this hallway,
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:34.380]   there's a room out there
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:36.620]   and that room will be full of other guys who say,
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:39.340]   hey, I'm looking to build healthy relationships
[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:41.260]   with other men who follow Christ.
[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:44.100]   And if you're a girl and you walk down this way right here,
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:46.580]   there's a room over there full of girls who say,
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:49.360]   hey, I would like to build healthy relationships
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.780]   with other women who follow Jesus.
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:55.020]   And so we would love to facilitate that here every Tuesday.
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:57.340]   If there's any way we can serve you,
[00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:58.900]   we desperately wanna do that.
[00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:00.240]   We're so glad that you would entrust
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:06.080]   Tuesday night to us and we will see you next week. Have a great week of worship.
