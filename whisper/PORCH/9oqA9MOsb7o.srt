1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,300
 - Welcome to the porch, we're so excited.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,300
 My name's David Marvin.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,060
 I could not be more thrilled to introduce to you a panel

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,060
 unlike any panel we've ever had before.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,620
 And so some of these faces you'll probably recognize

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,100
 and some of them you may meet

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,580
 or will be meeting tonight for the first time.

9
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,080
 So I'm gonna let our panel introduce themselves.

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,100
 You'll probably recognize Shane, Shane and JP,

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,580
 but Shane, why don't you start

12
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,580
 and you can introduce to us your better half,

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,140
 her lovely wife.

14
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,100
 - My name is Shane.

15
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,340
 And--

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,580
 - I think we got that.

17
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,540
 - This is Beth, my wife.

18
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:42,260
 She is the most beautiful woman in the whole world.

19
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,380
 - I'm not sure you're following instructions here.

20
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,220
 - And.

21
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,420
 - Okay, perfect.

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,820
 (laughing)

23
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,140
 That was really touching.

24
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,740
 So good luck, Shane.

25
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,260
 - So my name is Shane.

26
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,780
 This is my wife, Kelly.

27
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,860
 She's married the most beautiful man in the whole world.

28
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,100
 (laughing)

29
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,100
 - Wow.

30
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,660
 - I tell her you're welcome twice a day.

31
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,920
 (laughing)

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,340
 - All right, my name is Shane.

33
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,580
 (laughing)

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,380
 And it's just incredible just to be one of the greatest

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,140
 Christian vocalists in the world.

36
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,420
 And so I wrote you a song.

37
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,420
 ♪ The very first time ♪

38
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,980
 ♪ That I saw your green eyes ♪

39
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,100
 Kind of blue.

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,600
 ♪ Blue eyes ♪

41
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,020
 This is my wife, Monica,

42
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,660
 and it's fun to be here with you.

43
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,700
 Okay.

44
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,900
 - Powerful.

45
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,140
 So what I thought we'd do

46
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,340
 and what we're gonna have each couple do

47
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,820
 is kind of share briefly their story.

48
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,000
 And we even have some pictures of each couple

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,940
 from back in the day,

50
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,900
 which should be, if nothing else, entertaining.

51
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,940
 And so we're gonna look at those

52
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,240
 and why don't you guys start us out?

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,220
 How'd you meet?

54
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,500
 As we kind of explore for the last few weeks,

55
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,460
 if you haven't been with us,

56
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,380
 we're in this series called Battle of the Sexes,

57
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,980
 which is all about dating, marriage, sex, relationships,

58
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,100
 and really man and woman interacting.

59
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,060
 And so tonight, we're finishing,

60
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,820
 we're doing a panel to just address some of the questions

61
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,420
 that we did not cover,

62
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,100
 either because we didn't have the ability

63
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,820
 to take up an entire message for them

64
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,900
 or they just weren't on our radar,

65
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,540
 but thanks to you, they now are.

66
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,660
 So in order to get to know the couples,

67
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,700
 we just asked if they would prepare

68
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,520
 to be able to share briefly kind of their story,

69
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,140
 how they met and how long you've been married

70
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,540
 and where you are right now.

71
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,100
 - We, well, we've been married for six years,

72
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,980
 coming up in just a couple of weeks.

73
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,960
 And we met out on the road on tour.

74
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,220
 (laughing)

75
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,220
 - I'm not sure what to do with that.

76
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,060
 - I don't even know.

77
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,380
 - This is gonna be such a chain reaction.

78
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,900
 - This is what happened when you met?

79
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,940
 - No, that's the wrong picture.

80
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,300
 Is there another one?

81
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,540
 No, that's the wrong one.

82
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,500
 That's our family now.

83
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,700
 - That's the day you met.

84
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,180
 - She kissed me the first time we met.

85
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,220
 It was weird.

86
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,040
 No, you know, touring,

87
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,940
 Beth, her goad name is Bethany Dillon.

88
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,840
 - Because she's also a recording artist.

89
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,440
 - She is a famous Christian singer.

90
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,680
 (laughing)

91
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,160
 And no, she came on tour with us

92
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,800
 and going out on tour on a tour bus

93
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,280
 is a super unique situation

94
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,920
 because there's 12 bunks, there's 14 people,

95
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,600
 and you're out on the road for two months.

96
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,120
 And so we didn't share about that.

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,360
 I don't know why you said that.

98
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,360
 But no, it's just such an interesting--

99
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,300
 - The math is breaking down a little bit.

100
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,140
 - Yeah, well, you know--

101
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,960
 - 14 people.

102
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,700
 - I wanted to clarify.

103
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,540
 - We're all a little confused.

104
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,360
 - Yeah.

105
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
 - We're just going right past it.

106
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,460
 - We're just going right on past it.

107
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,260
 - So you met, you dated on a tour bus.

108
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,100
 - We didn't date.

109
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,380
 We didn't date, which that was lesson number two.

110
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,820
 Don't date on a tour bus.

111
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,820
 - We're all confused.

112
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,500
 - I know, we should have gone first.

113
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,340
 - You're married, though.

114
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,380
 That's where we met.

115
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,220
 - All right, I'll tell our story.

116
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,460
 So we met on the road.

117
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,460
 (audience cheering)

118
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:31,660
 And we're friends, and then liked each other,

119
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,160
 and then dated each other.

120
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,940
 And I lived in Ohio.

121
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,500
 I'm from Ohio, and he was here in Dallas.

122
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,300
 And it was kind of a long process

123
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,920
 from being friends to dating

124
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,600
 because there's an age difference between us

125
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,400
 of about 20 years, not really.

126
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,860
 But I'm just kidding.

127
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,040
 Not that much.

128
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,880
 - But close.

129
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,400
 - But close, no, not, no, anyway.

130
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,280
 - It's a decade.

131
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,280
 - So it took, I think it took a while

132
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,560
 for us to say that we liked each other

133
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,640
 and stop the texting and actually talk on the phone

134
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,960
 and make plans to see each other.

135
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,520
 And so, yeah, and then we dated for, right?

136
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,360
 'Cause I need to tell that.

137
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,880
 So we dated for almost a year,

138
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,060
 and then we were engaged for about 10 months.

139
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,680
 And then, yeah, we've been married for six years.

140
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,040
 We've got two kids, Lucy and Haven,

141
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,120
 who are awesome, and they're three and one.

142
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,360
 - Who we saw a second ago.

143
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,200
 - Yeah.

144
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,040
 - So beautiful.

145
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,280
 - I love it. - Not us, but yeah.

146
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,520
 - Amazing, okay, so I'm sure we'll hear more

147
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,240
 kind of as a question that's about your story

148
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,080
 and how those intersect.

149
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,960
 But what about you guys?

150
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,560
 So you guys met a long time ago in high school, right?

151
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,320
 - High school, yeah, we met in high school.

152
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,160
 So picture this.

153
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,160
 (audience laughing)

154
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,440
 Chemistry class.

155
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,000
 (audience laughing)

156
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,440
 Test tubes and love.

157
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,560
 (audience laughing)

158
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,080
 We served up a beaker of love.

159
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,200
 No, we didn't, we didn't date.

160
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,920
 We didn't date then.

161
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,920
 Kelly, we met in high school.

162
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,000
 She dated a buddy of mine, and then we didn't talk.

163
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,680
 (audience laughing)

164
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,680
 No, seriously, I didn't know the Lord in high school.

165
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,480
 I got saved my senior year in college,

166
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,840
 and Kelly knew the Lord in high school,

167
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,520
 at least the part that I knew her.

168
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,160
 She claims that we weren't friends,

169
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,080
 but in my mind, we were friends.

170
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,120
 (audience laughing)

171
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,520
 But I was at A&M, and she was at Baylor.

172
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,120
 (audience cheering)

173
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,440
 Yes, so we were, so anyway,

174
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,360
 I ended up getting saved my senior year,

175
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,240
 and went to Baylor for this thing,

176
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,480
 and we just happened to run into each other,

177
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,800
 and I was like, man, I need to talk to you.

178
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,080
 So she was the only, really the only Christian girl

179
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,920
 that I knew, and so I was like,

180
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,240
 man, my options are really small.

181
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,640
 (audience laughing)

182
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,400
 I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm so kidding.

183
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,240
 That's stupid.

184
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,120
 - This panel's going--

185
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,320
 - I'm available for marriage counseling.

186
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,400
 - Better than we thought.

187
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,720
 (audience laughing)

188
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,800
 - Anyway, so no.

189
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,840
 - It's turning out to be a bad idea.

190
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,720
 - Seriously, check this out.

191
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,600
 We were, I didn't really know any Christian girls,

192
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,200
 but I had this dance coming up called Ring Dance at A&M.

193
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,160
 And you got that picture?

194
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,080
 Throw that one up.

195
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,600
 Come on, guys.

196
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,480
 You knew it was coming.

197
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,600
 Anyway, so we went on, our first date

198
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,880
 was this thing called Ring Dance.

199
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,720
 - There it is.

200
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,200
 Are you sure that wasn't high school?

201
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,160
 - That was our first date, right there.

202
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,360
 April 26, 1997, is that right?

203
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,400
 I think it's right.

204
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,240
 Is that right?

205
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,160
 So we went on a date, and I was in love,

206
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,000
 and we dated for about eight months or so.

207
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,280
 Then she broke up with me, and here's a good dating tip.

208
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,800
 When she was breaking up with me,

209
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,440
 she lived in the, what were the apartments called?

210
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,280
 The Village at Baylor.

211
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,320
 She was like, "We need to break up."

212
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,000
 I'm like, "Oh, man, I'm not hearing that from the Lord."

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,600
 But anyway, she broke up with me.

214
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,960
 As I'm saying goodbye, like this is the final goodbye,

215
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,080
 she sticks her head out the door, and she goes,

216
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,960
 "I love you," shuts the door.

217
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,120
 Did you know that?

218
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,960
 You knew that, right?

219
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,040
 - I think that's gonna be a good thing to talk about

220
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,560
 when guarding the heart and all that.

221
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,120
 - Yeah. - That was the first time.

222
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,880
 - That was the first time she told me she loved me.

223
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,720
 "I love you," shut the door.

224
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,680
 - And locked it. - Locked it.

225
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,680
 - See you later, forever. - I was like.

226
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,800
 I'm calling the police.

227
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,480
 - Ask, seek, knock.

228
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,080
 - Yeah, so anyway, all that to say,

229
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,840
 after a few years, we ended up reconnecting.

230
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,400
 She went abroad for a few years, came back,

231
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,240
 and now we ended up reconnecting,

232
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,720
 getting engaged after about four months.

233
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,320
 We're married, now we're married almost 12 years,

234
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,880
 this coming up, in May.

235
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,520
 12 years, we have three girls,

236
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,200
 Olive, Lillian, and Emma, Rose.

237
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,200
 And Olive is seven, Lily is three,

238
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,360
 and Emma's nine months.

239
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,880
 So that's it, I'll shut up.

240
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,320
 There they are. - There they are.

241
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,880
 - I love it.

242
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,440
 We've been married nine and a half years,

243
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,280
 and we met in college.

244
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,120
 She was my best friend's sister,

245
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,360
 and so we were at a party, at an apartment,

246
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,200
 it wasn't really a party,

247
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,160
 we were hanging out at an apartment,

248
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,120
 and I told him, hey, his sister wanted to come over,

249
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,320
 and he was like, oh man, my sister wants to come over,

250
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,880
 and I was like, man, I'd like to meet your sister.

251
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,800
 And I had no idea how badly I wanted to meet his sister.

252
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,560
 And basically, we were not Christians,

253
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,880
 if you know my story, if you've been hanging out

254
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,080
 with us for a while, and so it was just kind of,

255
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,520
 it was everything not to do,

256
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,800
 that's pretty much Monica and I's story.

257
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,600
 I moved to Dallas, she stayed in Waco,

258
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,040
 we started dating in a committed relationship,

259
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,000
 it was manic highs and lows, I love you, I hate you.

260
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,320
 I probably went through depression in that time,

261
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,800
 just from being here and not really knowing anyone,

262
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,840
 and just kind of holding onto that Waco,

263
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,560
 that college lifestyle.

264
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,160
 And then I was at a bar, hungover,

265
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,320
 I was at a bar, invited to church, came, hungover,

266
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,840
 trusted Christ, radical life change, talked to her,

267
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,480
 I said, you know, who do you believe,

268
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,520
 what do you believe about God,

269
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,080
 and we had talked about God before,

270
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,440
 and she had straightened out morally before I did,

271
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,120
 and so she kind of got on the straight and narrow,

272
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,240
 and didn't think partying was still fun like I did,

273
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,480
 and she just matured, you know,

274
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,640
 and so she articulated the gospel,

275
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,600
 we both kind of knew the gospel,

276
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,960
 and she articulated the gospel,

277
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,280
 and I said, okay, I believe that too,

278
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,440
 we need to figure this deal out,

279
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,000
 and God just kind of came in our lives,

280
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,600
 and we were not pure by any stretch of the imagination,

281
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,160
 and then we stepped into that world,

282
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,120
 and said, okay, now we need to stop all things sexual here,

283
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,960
 which was incredibly difficult, as you can imagine,

284
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,120
 and so then shortly thereafter,

285
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,360
 you know, the way that that works out,

286
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,840
 once you cut off the physical,

287
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,640
 I mean, we were engaged very shortly thereafter,

288
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,960
 (audience laughing)

289
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,760
 'cause my friend Paul says,

290
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,040
 it's better to marry than to burn,

291
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,040
 and so we did, we were engaged for four months.

292
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:40,400
 - Is she having more? - She's counting, she said.

293
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,040
 Yeah, four, five months, so we were engaged five months,

294
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,120
 and then married, and I'll tell you more about this later,

295
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,200
 but essentially, Christ was at the center of our lives

296
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,480
 at that time, but there was just a lot of baggage,

297
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,600
 and so we spent about three years in our marriage

298
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,280
 really healing from all of the baggage

299
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,520
 that we brought into it,

300
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,240
 which was pretty difficult times, frankly,

301
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,440
 and so today, we have two little girls,

302
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,800
 Presley and Finley, and then a 17-month-old in Weston.

303
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,400
 I don't know if we have those, do we show any pictures?

304
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,480
 So there's the family.

305
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,400
 That's good.

306
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,720
 - Well, that really transitions,

307
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,200
 or your story's a perfect transition

308
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,600
 to one of the first questions that's come in,

309
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,000
 which is about if two believers are dating,

310
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,240
 and they're not initially sexually pure,

311
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,120
 but are now wanting to pursue purity,

312
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,800
 what are some practical steps to help with this?

313
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,920
 And really, your story answers the second question,

314
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,340
 and is it even possible to have a healthy relationship

315
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,240
 after sexual impurity, which could still lead to marriage?

316
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,320
 So practical steps on a couple

317
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,880
 that's had sexual past together,

318
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,480
 like they've made a mistake, but they're saying,

319
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,240
 hey, we wanna fight, and we wanna pursue purity,

320
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,320
 what would you say are some steps that helped?

321
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,080
 - Yeah, I just think once you start pursuing Christ,

322
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,200
 you become a new creation, right?

323
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,580
 And so God's bigger than that,

324
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,320
 but you have to pursue him, ultimate in your life.

325
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,560
 In 1 Corinthians 6, it just says,

326
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,080
 flee sexual immorality.

327
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,760
 And so the easiest way to flee sexual immorality

328
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,880
 is to Matthew 6, 33,

329
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,160
 seek first his kingdom and his righteousness.

330
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,000
 And all that other stuff, he's gonna add to it,

331
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,960
 he tells you, but if you seek him first,

332
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,000
 and so I'm not talking about

333
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,400
 check the box Dallas Christian,

334
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,760
 like I'm going to church and the porch on Tuesday,

335
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,440
 I'm talking about the trajectory of your life

336
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,460
 is pursuing the creator of the heavens and the earth,

337
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,600
 that's why you were created.

338
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,960
 Once you begin doing that,

339
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,200
 we had a guy tell us this in premarital counseling,

340
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,680
 he just says, hey, stop pursuing each other,

341
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,800
 'cause we were, you know,

342
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,080
 just pursuing each other with everything.

343
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,160
 He says, stop pursuing each other

344
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,360
 and start pursuing the Lord together.

345
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,440
 And I thought that was such stupid advice

346
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,880
 until it was really what saved us.

347
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,280
 I mean, it was what gave us marriage

348
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,460
 and preserved our marriage,

349
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,360
 is when we started pursuing God ultimately,

350
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,740
 see, when you pursue each other, it's hit or miss,

351
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,120
 but when you pursue God ultimately,

352
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,240
 you're constantly growing closer and closer together,

353
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,200
 and you're trusting the spirit to make you

354
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,280
 and conform you to the image and the character of Jesus.

355
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,240
 And so two human beings cannot get along.

356
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,000
 I mean, we don't do that well,

357
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,680
 particularly when you're male and female,

358
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,640
 you're so different,

359
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,040
 but when you're pursuing the Lord

360
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,440
 and he's making you both like Christ,

361
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,120
 all of the sudden there is a spirit of oneness that happens.

362
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
 What would you add?

363
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,340
 - Yeah, I think just, and even in hearing that question,

364
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,080
 and when Jonathan, or sorry, I call him Jonathan, not JP.

365
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,800
 And so when he came to me last week

366
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,040
 and just said, "Hey, we're gonna do this panel,

367
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
 "here's what we're thinking."

368
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,040
 And I just immediately was like, "Oh no, that's not me."

369
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,560
 And just really feeling inadequate to get up here

370
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,440
 and talk on just dating and what that looks like,

371
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,020
 because we just did everything wrong.

372
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,580
 I mean, the Lord did grab hold of our hearts,

373
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,760
 and so thankful for that.

374
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,240
 And so the one thing that we didn't even do,

375
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,920
 he did, is just redeem us.

376
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,280
 And so no matter where you are, or where you've been,

377
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,720
 or what you've done, I mean,

378
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,800
 he is more powerful than any of it.

379
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,920
 And he redeems and he saves.

380
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,680
 And the verse that I think of is,

381
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,020
 "While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."

382
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,760
 And so it is not what you're gonna be,

383
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,920
 or what you were, but where you are right now.

384
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,440
 I mean, he just comes in and redeems and makes new.

385
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,920
 - Yeah, and I just pursue him ultimately,

386
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,600
 would be what I say, and he can.

387
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,880
 If you're not gonna pursue him ultimately,

388
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,080
 break up right now.

389
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,480
 Like, don't waste any more time.

390
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,880
 - Excellent.

391
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,920
 Okay, so this question would probably be good for you guys,

392
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,160
 'cause I'm sure you had to do this.

393
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,080
 But we talk about guarding against sexual impurity.

394
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,600
 How do you guard your heart emotionally?

395
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,800
 And being in a bus, I'm sure you either

396
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,840
 did this well or didn't.

397
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,320
 And so maybe you can speak to how

398
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,080
 you would answer that question.

399
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,760
 (audience laughing)

400
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,760
 - There's actually one night that was really weird, 'cause--

401
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,280
 (audience laughing)

402
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,520
 Shane and I, we were bus drivers.

403
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,680
 So most of the time, most of our lives,

404
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,760
 we've been driving a bus.

405
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,000
 So he would drive at night, till like a tour,

406
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,960
 yeah, the tour bus, till like 3 a.m. or 4 a.m.,

407
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,600
 and then I would get up in the morning,

408
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,680
 and I would finish the drive at like 6 o'clock.

409
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,140
 Well, I'm a really light sleeper,

410
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,020
 and so I just, we would go all day.

411
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,400
 We would play every single day, or six out of seven days.

412
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,960
 And so we would just be traveling across the country,

413
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,320
 and I would go to bed at one or two in the morning,

414
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,680
 and then Shane would be driving, so that's terrifying.

415
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,520
 Because he would be watching a DVD,

416
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,560
 the computer screen would be up,

417
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,640
 he'd be on the phone, be playing a video game,

418
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,480
 and driving a bus full of people.

419
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,920
 And so I would just be terrified.

420
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,800
 And so I started to take Ambien to help me sleep,

421
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,440
 which totally worked.

422
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,160
 But so I took Ambien one night,

423
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,920
 and then I tried to go to bed, and--

424
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,960
 - Do we need to preface anything here?

425
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,120
 - Like something would happen,

426
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,560
 and I would turn into like Shane-bian.

427
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,960
 (audience laughing)

428
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,480
 And I don't even remember this,

429
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,840
 but there was one night where I started

430
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,160
 messing with, playing with Beth's toes.

431
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,480
 (audience laughing)

432
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,320
 - What?

433
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,160
 - Someone else was there.

434
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,200
 This is so weird.

435
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,000
 I feel like I'm just getting more and more scared

436
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,440
 of your answers, the longer we're on this.

437
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
 (audience laughing)

438
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,200
 - No, I would just say, I would say,

439
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,680
 I would say, you know, self-control.

440
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,480
 (audience laughing)

441
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,760
 No, seriously, seriously.

442
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,840
 Like, man, you wanna guard, you wanna guard--

443
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,920
 - It sounds like, you have self-control.

444
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,080
 - Well, the toe incident was, yeah, it was wrong.

445
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,400
 I repented.

446
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,440
 - Shane, I got self-control out of that.

447
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,200
 That's what I heard, self-control.

448
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,920
 (audience laughing)

449
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,760
 - No, I would just say--

450
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,280
 - He was there too, so that was a camera.

451
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,120
 - Yeah, self-control.

452
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,360
 I mean, you know, our version of dating,

453
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,320
 you guys have done such a great job of teaching on dating.

454
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,320
 And we have a tendency to adopt

455
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,520
 all of our culture's ideas of dating.

456
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,880
 And so it's like, you know, hang out with a girl,

457
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,880
 hold hands, kiss, connect the dots, you know,

458
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,960
 touch the toes, you know.

459
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,320
 It just, it goes there.

460
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,440
 Just don't do that.

461
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,320
 I mean, just don't do that.

462
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,600
 Why would you, I mean, like, yeah,

463
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,280
 I would just say, if you treat,

464
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,680
 like do some of the things that we've heard

465
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,280
 the last few weeks, like if you haven't heard it,

466
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,200
 just go back and podcast it.

467
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,160
 If you treat a woman like your sister,

468
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,520
 it helps with the guarding of the heart thing, you know.

469
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,560
 Because you don't have to, you haven't crossed

470
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,480
 all these sexual boundaries that you have to,

471
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,440
 that you have to all of a sudden go, oh, you know,

472
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,920
 I did that, and see you later.

473
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,320
 And, you know, on top of a whole--

474
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,360
 - But what about emotional guarding?

475
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,080
 - And it sounds like you guys communicated,

476
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,000
 you reached a point where you said,

477
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,200
 hey, we can't just text any longer.

478
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,920
 We're gonna communicate really well

479
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,240
 on where we're going and what's going on,

480
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,760
 which probably helped at some level guarding the heart.

481
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,760
 - I would say he's hilarious and so, you know,

482
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:33,080
 so wise, like the Lord really, for all of his funniness

483
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,360
 and quirkiness, when I think about our story,

484
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,960
 like, and before that even, he was on the road a lot

485
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,560
 as a single man, and there are a lot of stories

486
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,000
 of girls who had crushes on him or would talk to him,

487
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,600
 and he really had to, like, be disciplined

488
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,760
 in guarding people's hearts as far as, like,

489
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,440
 length of conversation or being in the same room

490
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,320
 with someone or being in the same car on a road trip

491
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,600
 or I've heard as his wife multiple stories.

492
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,760
 So I know that the Lord really gave him

493
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,040
 a lot of grace in that and so then when we started

494
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,480
 liking each other and then dating long distance

495
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,560
 and there was almost an impatience in me

496
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,840
 of wanting him to just, like, cut to the chase

497
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,960
 and say, I love you, I wanna get married

498
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,280
 because I felt that in my heart,

499
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,400
 but then, like, later on in our,

500
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,720
 in, like, further down the road and we are engaged,

501
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,320
 like, it took him a long time even to just talk

502
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,880
 about marriage, like, he didn't, which this isn't a rule,

503
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,680
 but he didn't wanna talk about marriage

504
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,680
 until it was like, I've got a ring for him

505
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,680
 because it was like, I wanna guard your heart.

506
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,600
 Like, I don't want, I don't wanna, like,

507
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,520
 string this out and play this out in your mind

508
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,000
 and in your heart and we're far apart

509
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,640
 and, you know, not guard my heart.

510
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,640
 And so I would say that he did it really well

511
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,760
 as far as just being thoughtful

512
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,600
 about what we even talked about

513
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,360
 and the way that our time together looked and, you know.

514
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,320
 - Yeah, that's excellent, love it.

515
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,320
 Well, this next question says, and so E,

516
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
 maybe you and Kelly can speak to this one.

517
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,760
 Is it ever okay for a girl to nudge

518
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,420
 or slash pursue a boy she's interested in?

519
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:27,120
 (congregation laughing)

520
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,960
 - Uh.

521
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:39,200
 Well, you know, I mean, I think it's weird.

522
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,000
 (congregation laughing)

523
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,560
 - Can I say something? - Yeah.

524
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:50,640
 - Okay, I like this question because Shane would be

525
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,640
 like the poster boy for what it looks like to pursue a girl.

526
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,320
 And I'm gonna get teary a little bit.

527
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,120
 (congregation laughing)

528
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,800
 He is a beautiful man.

529
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,800
 - The book's coming, the book's coming.

530
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,640
 - Oh, hi.

531
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,000
 - I'm just kidding. - You're welcome.

532
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,840
 - Yeah.

533
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,360
 Anyway, I just wanna start too

534
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,480
 with just a verse that's coming to mind.

535
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,400
 And in looking back, I just see that this,

536
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,080
 that God's word proves itself true.

537
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,640
 And it usually happens in our humanity to look back

538
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,980
 and go, oh yeah, you were right, Lord.

539
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:34,760
 But in Ephesians 5:33, I think it says,

540
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,000
 wives or husbands love your wives,

541
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,380
 wives respect your husbands.

542
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:46,380
 And I can see how in the way that you pursued me,

543
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,880
 in the way that we're created,

544
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,200
 or a woman's heart wants to be pursued.

545
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,280
 We wanna be loved and men wanna be respected.

546
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,760
 And so backing up, so I was at Baylor

547
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,720
 and Shane was at A&M and I worked at a coffee shop

548
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,680
 at Common Grounds and it's still cool.

549
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,520
 And I am a morning person, so I took the morning shift

550
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,480
 at 6 a.m., opened the coffee shop.

551
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,480
 And Shane would leave A&M, I guess you had to leave

552
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,120
 at like 4.30 in the morning to get to Common Grounds

553
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,500
 an hour and a half later by six to meet me there

554
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,480
 to help me open the coffee shop.

555
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,000
 And he would help me sweep and mop up

556
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,320
 and get ready for the day.

557
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,200
 And then I had an eight o'clock class

558
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,260
 so then he would leave.

559
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,320
 And then another time we were,

560
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,320
 or I was pulling an all-nighter in Baylor's library

561
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,040
 and just up typing a paper down in the basement

562
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,520
 where all the computers were back then.

563
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,360
 And I'm sitting there typing and I look over

564
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,400
 and there's Shane and he goes to A&M

565
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,480
 but he's at Baylor's library.

566
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,520
 And I look over and I'm like, Shane, Shane,

567
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,440
 what are you doing?

568
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,000
 He's like, oh hey, what's up?

569
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,440
 [audience laughing]

570
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,320
 And you're not even supposed to be able to get

571
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,920
 in the library unless you're a Baylor student.

572
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,400
 So he would just maneuver, he would place himself

573
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,440
 at different places around campus.

574
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,800
 I'd be running the bear trail.

575
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,920
 And he drove this big red truck

576
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,700
 and my accountability partner's like, isn't that Shane?

577
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,540
 [audience laughing]

578
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,040
 And I'd be like, yeah, it is, what are you doing here?

579
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,120
 >> It's kind of psychotic, it's kind of stalkerish.

580
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,200
 [audience laughing]

581
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,440
 But she was into me, you know?

582
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,000
 So it made a difference.

583
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,360
 >> But anyway, all that to say is that

584
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,120
 he really pursued me.

585
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,120
 There were just endless stories that I could tell

586
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,520
 to people about and they could see

587
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,240
 that this person is pursuing you.

588
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,480
 This person loves you, he likes being around you,

589
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,520
 he respects you, all of this.

590
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,800
 And even if I wasn't that into him,

591
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,280
 I mean, it really made me go, wow,

592
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,120
 this person really likes me, this person really loves me.

593
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,840
 There was no doubt about it in my mind

594
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,280
 that I was being pursued.

595
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,080
 And then the very natural response to that is,

596
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,960
 do I want to be pursued?

597
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,180
 Do I like this?

598
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:36,180
 And so, you know, then I could say no or yes.

599
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,560
 And I did like it and I did like him,

600
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,000
 and so I allowed that.

601
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,280
 And now that we've been married for 11 years

602
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,900
 and we have three children and life is messy

603
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,240
 and I'm changing diapers and the girls are sick,

604
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,400
 or you know, it just, you have layers and layers

605
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,720
 of these roles now as a wife and a mother

606
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,320
 and all of these things and life gets hard.

607
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,280
 And even when we conflict, I can think back

608
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,160
 to where we started and there's a confidence

609
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,440
 in knowing this man pursued me, he loved me,

610
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,040
 and he loves me, and that's where we started.

611
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:21,040
 So, I just think back to being single

612
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,640
 and wondering who my husband would be one day

613
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,480
 and for all you girls out there that, you know,

614
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,480
 are single and I just know it's in every girl's heart

615
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,640
 to be pursued and you wanna be sure.

616
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,800
 You don't wanna be married five years in

617
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,760
 and have a conflict and go, you know what?

618
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,880
 You never loved me anyway.

619
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,340
 You didn't pursue me, you know?

620
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,420
 And 'cause that's where you go, you go back.

621
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,000
 When you're having a hard time, you go, okay,

622
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,760
 why am I married?

623
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,600
 Oh yeah.

624
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,880
 Anyway, there you go.

625
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,360
 I love you.

626
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,200
 - Okay.

627
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,760
 So, no, but tons of good stuff.

628
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,980
 Like, you responded and you communicated,

629
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,240
 hey, keep pursuing me, which is big 'cause when guys pursue,

630
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,400
 girls need to say either stop or yes.

631
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,640
 - Yeah, I think there's just a level of,

632
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,340
 I think just in general, I think our culture is,

633
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,240
 they're big feelers.

634
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,660
 I mean, I think we're all kind of feelers

635
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,560
 and we wanna feel it out.

636
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,660
 We don't wanna put ourself out there

637
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,240
 because we're scared of the rejection

638
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,480
 or we're scared of hurting someone's feeling.

639
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,220
 Girls, hurt their feelings, they'll be fine.

640
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,480
 You know, hurt their feelings.

641
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,560
 It's not worth it.

642
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,600
 It's not worth dragging some poor dude along

643
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,560
 that you're like, ah, you know, I guess he's,

644
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,920
 you know, he's somebody.

645
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,760
 That's ridiculous.

646
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,600
 Don't do that.

647
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,340
 And guys, vice versa.

648
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,860
 It's just like, man, don't hang out with her

649
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,840
 'cause she's fine.

650
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,800
 If you're not pursuing her, you know she likes you

651
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,560
 and you know if he likes you.

652
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,320
 To think that you don't is great.

653
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,680
 You know, you always hear people talking like,

654
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,040
 ah, we're just hanging out.

655
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,280
 I don't like him, but he's fun.

656
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,960
 Pays for dinner, come on.

657
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,720
 You know, like, I think the reality is

658
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,640
 it's just like usually somebody's liking somebody, you know?

659
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,700
 And I think we all kind of glaze over that,

660
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,700
 but I think you guys know what the other's intent is

661
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:26,000
 and I think as long as you are clear,

662
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,520
 I think you can save friendships

663
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,360
 and you can save a lot of heartache

664
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,740
 if you just, you are clear.

665
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,240
 You can't be responsible for if somebody else is clear.

666
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,440
 You know, it's just like if you're a girl

667
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,400
 and you got the dude that's taking you out

668
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,960
 for 16 Dutch dates, you know,

669
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,560
 and you're like, are we doing this?

670
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,440
 And if he's like, you know, hey man,

671
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,720
 you know, we're just having a good time.

672
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,440
 Get rid of that jerk, you know?

673
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
 It's just like, come on.

674
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,840
 And guys, vice versa.

675
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,480
 You know, I mean, I just think,

676
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,880
 just be honest with each other about where you are,

677
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,320
 you know, emotionally and like, man, I'm in this thing.

678
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,120
 I'm pursuing you, you know?

679
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,120
 And if not, you know, go see a movie by yourself.

680
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,420
 (congregation laughing)

681
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,180
 - Really good, anything you'd add?

682
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:13,940
 I know you've said before, maybe not ask out,

683
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,640
 but put yourself in front of them

684
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,140
 or you wouldn't say that's what it is.

685
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,620
 - Yeah, I just think, I think, man,

686
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,580
 a good play is the serving, you know,

687
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,340
 serve somewhere, serve together.

688
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,300
 You don't have to, okay?

689
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,660
 Like, trust God, God's big.

690
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,860
 He controls everything.

691
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,980
 Like, don't lose sight of that.

692
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,900
 Like, God really does control everything.

693
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,980
 He's sovereign and he loves you.

694
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,900
 He loves you more than you'll ever get your mind around,

695
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,420
 that he loves you, he has a plan for you.

696
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,660
 Don't give up on him, okay?

697
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,420
 And so, serve somewhere.

698
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,100
 I mean, continue to be faithful, continue to pursue him.

699
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,820
 And you know, he does have a plan for your life.

700
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,660
 And you don't have to be bold and,

701
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,940
 I mean, if you ask a dude out,

702
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,180
 you're probably gonna end up with a passive guy.

703
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,780
 And I see that all the time and it's just a train wreck, so.

704
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,060
 - Yes, and I think, too,

705
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,780
 I would just add to that,

706
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:02,220
 that I was talking with a friend

707
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,740
 just the other night about this,

708
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,420
 just in that, you know, if you see a guy,

709
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,260
 if you're a girl and you see a guy and you're like,

710
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,580
 oh, I really like him, you know,

711
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,020
 I would love for him to ask me out.

712
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,300
 And I feel like you start going down a path

713
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,740
 of almost fantasizing, oh, well,

714
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,020
 I wonder what it'd be like to date him.

715
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,100
 And I wonder, you know, what this is like

716
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,140
 and I wonder what that is like.

717
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,940
 And instead of doing that, like, absolutely,

718
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,780
 you can pull out qualities of godliness

719
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,220
 that you see in, you know, whoever it is,

720
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,020
 but don't make it a personal thing where it's,

721
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,020
 oh, I've gotta have that guy.

722
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,260
 And so there might be qualities in that guy

723
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,140
 that you're like, you know what,

724
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,580
 I would love to marry a man that has that quality,

725
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,020
 but just not making it personal.

726
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,980
 And that helps to guard, I think,

727
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,060
 a woman's heart, just in that.

728
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,780
 - That's great, excellent.

729
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,900
 So next one is for you guys.

730
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,740
 Can you go on a date with several people

731
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,740
 or can you date at the same time several different people?

732
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:06,260
 - Well, I would say it depends on how you define date.

733
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,900
 I think that if you're, you know,

734
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,540
 seeking a relationship, then no.

735
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:17,140
 You know, the Bible tells us to, you know,

736
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,740
 even just the golden rule of loving others

737
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,500
 as you would love your, or love others

738
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,060
 as you would be loved, as you would wanna be loved.

739
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,220
 And it's just not loving to anyone,

740
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,500
 to yourself or to other people.

741
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,500
 If you're in a relationship with more than one person,

742
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,020
 I would say, you know, just a casual date

743
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,060
 that is nothing, you know, it's just,

744
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,260
 hey, do you wanna hang out or do you wanna grab coffee?

745
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,780
 Or I think it depends on how you're defining date

746
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,620
 that I would say.

747
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,900
 - Yeah, can you go on a date, you know,

748
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,540
 can you go on a date this week with a date,

749
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,900
 hey, sorry, not interested, next week,

750
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,140
 can you go on a date, hey, sorry, not interested?

751
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,500
 Here's what I'd say, everything you're doing,

752
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,100
 you're earning reputation, you need to know that.

753
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,860
 And so, man, the circles of which

754
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,180
 you can actually marry someone,

755
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,300
 they're really small circles.

756
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,820
 I mean, the whole world, and then like the ones

757
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,380
 who really follow Jesus, that's a really small circle.

758
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,100
 And so all of a sudden, you're the guy that's like,

759
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,740
 yeah, man, you know, girls are like,

760
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,260
 oh, you know, he asked out my best friend last week

761
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,060
 and my other best friend this week and me, you know,

762
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,700
 and so then you're that guy.

763
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,260
 So be careful, 'cause you're earning reputation.

764
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,500
 It depends on how you date.

765
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,380
 And so if you're there and you're leaving them

766
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,980
 better than you found them, then she would just say,

767
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,820
 hey, you know what, I'm bummed that there's not

768
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,700
 a second date, but I can't hold anything against you

769
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,900
 based on the way you talked to me,

770
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,980
 the way you were honest with me,

771
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,940
 you looked me in the eyes, and you told me,

772
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,780
 you kind of, you didn't leave me to wonder.

773
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,300
 But can you date multiple people at one time?

774
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,660
 I would say that doesn't honor God.

775
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,700
 Romans 12, nine says that love must be sincere.

776
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,740
 Paul says to the Philippians,

777
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,100
 do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit.

778
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,340
 We see throughout the scriptures,

779
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,220
 consider others more important than yourselves,

780
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,300
 or as Monica said, love others how you wanna be loved,

781
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,140
 give to other people.

782
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,180
 And so nobody wants to be the person

783
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,220
 that's kind of dating, so I mean, you know what I mean?

784
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,620
 Like we see, I know we see that on TV,

785
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,180
 where one person's dating a bunch of people at one time,

786
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,060
 and it looks ideal and it looks okay.

787
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,700
 It's not okay, it was never God's ideal.

788
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,600
 It was never, ever, ever God's ideal.

789
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,020
 - Amazing.

790
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,860
 So this one's come up a few times,

791
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,020
 just been texted in, thoughts,

792
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,260
 and we've touched on this a little bit at the porch,

793
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,520
 but online dating.

794
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,060
 So do you guys have thoughts on what is appropriate

795
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,820
 and not appropriate, and how would you handle,

796
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,140
 specifically it's come in, hey,

797
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,520
 what are your thoughts on online dating?

798
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,660
 Any advice on how to handle online dating?

799
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,700
 What, is online dating okay?

800
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:42,220
 - I have no idea.

801
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,860
 (audience laughing)

802
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,260
 I have a good friend, I have a good friend who

803
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:52,740
 doesn't have, or doesn't even put himself in a position

804
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,220
 to have a lot of avenues to meet people.

805
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,220
 And so online dating is a commonplace for him,

806
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,460
 but it doesn't usually end up very good.

807
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:06,500
 And so I'm a bad person to ask, I really don't know.

808
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,860
 I would assume that there is a whole bunch of stories

809
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,700
 that have made it and have been God-honoring.

810
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,620
 I just don't know one, so.

811
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,580
 - Two things I'd say, here's what I'd tell you.

812
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,620
 So there's just two things you can live by, okay?

813
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,660
 Don't date a stranger, okay?

814
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,700
 And so what I mean by that is,

815
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,060
 you should have some level of information about someone

816
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,300
 before you engage with them,

817
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,860
 and before you're alone with them at Starbucks or wherever,

818
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,640
 you should know, hey, this person's sold out for Christ.

819
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,500
 They have an honorable reputation.

820
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,620
 And then I would say, so one, don't date a stranger.

821
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,860
 Two, profiles lie, okay?

822
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,500
 And so I can be whoever I wanna be online.

823
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,740
 Don't get catfished, right?

824
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,220
 I mean, that's happening.

825
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,060
 And so I can be online and be like,

826
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,380
 oh man, I just got back from starting an orphanage in Haiti

827
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,940
 and I saved kittens from burning buildings

828
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,740
 and I love Jesus with all my heart,

829
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,220
 and I could be a serial killer.

830
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:09,220
 And so just be wise in the way that you go about that.

831
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,980
 Here's the biblical perspective on online dating,

832
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,980
 there's not one.

833
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,220
 And so God doesn't say, hey, thou shalt not.

834
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,100
 I'm not gonna tell you thou shalt not, but be wise.

835
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,980
 Don't date a stranger, profiles lie.

836
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,140
 - Amazing.

837
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,980
 Well, how about this?

838
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,300
 We've talked about this a little bit earlier

839
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,500
 about how specifically the question is,

840
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,540
 Psalm 37 promises the desires of my heart.

841
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,940
 Does this include desires for a husband and for children?

842
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,700
 How do I know if marriage is a part of God's plan for me?

843
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:46,060
 - I would say that I think that desires to be married

844
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:50,460
 and be a parent are godly desires,

845
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,860
 especially as a believer.

846
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:57,260
 One of my dearest friends is, I grew up with her,

847
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:01,380
 and she's single and actually lived with us.

848
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,940
 She was living overseas and came back and lived with us

849
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,100
 for a year at our house,

850
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,660
 which was a wonderful year to get to hang with her.

851
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,020
 And she has a huge desire to be married.

852
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,660
 And then even more so when she lived with us,

853
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,940
 I was pregnant for our second while she was living with us

854
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:25,500
 and had our second within that span of a year.

855
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,140
 And so she was involved in the nitty gritty of,

856
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,900
 you know, just like everyday married life, being a mom.

857
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,860
 She got really connected with the girls

858
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,820
 and was really honest with me.

859
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,820
 You know, she had some hard days of like,

860
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,580
 I really desire this.

861
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,860
 And I would say that she, for me,

862
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,300
 because I got married young,

863
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,260
 and so it's just been good for me

864
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:52,260
 and such a learning experience of trusting the Lord.

865
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,760
 And she's just set a really good example, I feel like,

866
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,300
 as far as desiring those things,

867
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,860
 but those things not being ultimate things.

868
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,980
 Mark Driscoll, the pastor of a church called Mars Hill

869
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,940
 in Seattle, has said a few times

870
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,220
 that good things can quickly become bad things

871
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,980
 when they become ultimate things.

872
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,400
 And so I just see her, I mean, it's a process.

873
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,300
 She's not everyday like, I wanna be married and a mom,

874
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,260
 but whatever, I just love the Lord.

875
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,180
 I mean, it's a wrestling in her heart

876
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,580
 because it hasn't happened

877
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,300
 and there's nothing on the horizon.

878
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,100
 And she's awesome, you know, and she's pursuing the Lord

879
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,300
 and she's being, you know, faithful.

880
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,140
 I mean, messy faithful, like I'm messy faithful,

881
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,100
 but she's being faithful and loves Him

882
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,460
 and is in community and serving and in the Word

883
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,180
 and praying and doing all the right things,

884
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,260
 all the checks, you know, and it's not happening,

885
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,760
 and that's a desire of hers.

886
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,820
 But I feel like the Lord is just teaching her a lot

887
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,660
 about contentment in Him and also being honest

888
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:59,340
 because those aren't bad things to desire.

889
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,020
 I think it's just a hard place to be in.

890
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,740
 And so even though I'm not single,

891
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,620
 I feel like she's living that out in a good way

892
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,900
 because He's what satisfies our hearts

893
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,980
 'cause she saw firsthand in our house, like,

894
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,980
 oh, being a wife, even to Shane Bernard,

895
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:19,020
 even though he's awesome, being a wife and being a mom

896
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,740
 doesn't make you happy perfectly all the time, you know?

897
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,860
 Like, Beth doesn't have an awesome day every day

898
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,940
 because she's married and she's a mom.

899
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,060
 Like, she knows that, but she saw that.

900
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,460
 And still she desires that.

901
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,700
 And so I think it's that cyclical, like,

902
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,340
 yeah, He satisfies her heart

903
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,420
 and He's also put the wiring in her of like,

904
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,900
 I wanna be a mom.

905
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,620
 I wanna walk alongside someone.

906
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:47,340
 And so anyway, I just think she's faithfully walking

907
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,340
 that out and I'm really encouraged by it.

908
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,660
 - Yeah, that's great, Beth.

909
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,820
 I would say, truly, Psalm 37 says,

910
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,820
 "Delight yourself in the Lord

911
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,460
 "and He will give the desires of your heart."

912
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,980
 And we love that second part

913
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,580
 and we forsake that first part.

914
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,620
 And so Psalm 37 is not a promise

915
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,780
 that if you want a husband and children,

916
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,860
 that you will have that.

917
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,820
 There are a lot of things that I want that I don't have

918
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,340
 and there are a lot of things that I want that are unhealthy.

919
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,620
 And so specifically, that first part

920
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,420
 is delight yourself in the Lord.

921
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,260
 And as we see in Luke 11, Jesus says,

922
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,740
 "Hey, this is how you pray."

923
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,820
 And at the end of it, it says,

924
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,460
 "Your father desires to give you good things.

925
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,380
 "He's a perfect, loving Father in heaven

926
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,660
 "whose all power is His."

927
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,720
 And at the end of it, it says,

928
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,900
 "This is how He answers your prayers.

929
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,140
 "He gives you more of His Spirit."

930
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,180
 And so as you bring your request to God,

931
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,940
 there isn't a lining of the heart that happens

932
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,540
 and He gives you more of Him.

933
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,780
 And I promise you, that's better than a husband.

934
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,260
 And so you live in a broken world.

935
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,520
 I mean, there are good things that you desire.

936
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,900
 We see in the Proverbs that, you know,

937
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,900
 he who finds a wife finds a good thing,

938
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,500
 that marriage is a good thing.

939
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,980
 But it's not promised to you and you're gonna be okay.

940
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,580
 And if you trust in Christ, you're gonna die

941
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,660
 and you're gonna go to heaven.

942
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,180
 And I'm still really confused

943
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,940
 when heaven stopped being good enough.

944
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,860
 Like we put so much stake on this life

945
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,260
 and the German shepherd, the picket fence,

946
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,460
 the house in Frisco, you know,

947
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,260
 the spouse, two kids, boy and girl.

948
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,120
 Listen, you get heaven at the end of this deal

949
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,060
 and you're not even married in heaven.

950
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,180
 Marriage is an ultimate.

951
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,980
 God tells us you're not married in heaven.

952
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,380
 And so, listen, here's what just happened.

953
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,940
 Yeah, right, Joker, you're married.

954
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,340
 You know, your wife's sitting right next to you.

955
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,460
 How can you tell us that?

956
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,900
 I get it, I spend a lot of my time with single people.

957
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,400
 Okay, a lot of my time.

958
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,160
 You're not a lesser than.

959
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,260
 You're not in a waiting room.

960
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,300
 You're not in a holding tank, okay?

961
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,940
 You will never in your entire life

962
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,660
 be able to be used more for the kingdom

963
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,100
 than you are right now.

964
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,900
 Check out what Jesus says in Matthew 19, you know?

965
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,080
 He says, "It's good to be single

966
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,520
 "for the sake of my kingdom."

967
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,560
 And so, you've got resources that, frankly,

968
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,760
 I've got three kids and responsibilities

969
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,640
 that do weigh me down, not that they're bad things,

970
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,000
 but I have responsibilities that you don't have.

971
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,320
 And I do, I think my greatest regret,

972
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,680
 our greatest regret as single folks

973
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,440
 is, man, we just wish we would've used that life

974
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,260
 for pursuing God rather than the bar or the next thrill.

975
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,260
 - So, this is one that just came in for you guys.

976
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,380
 What do you do if you're dating someone

977
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,180
 who's not a Christian?

978
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,740
 Do you stay with them and try to bring them to God

979
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,940
 or do you break it off?

980
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:22,340
 - You just taught on this.

981
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,620
 I gotta be careful.

982
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:27,360
 I think you break it off, that's what I think.

983
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,140
 I mean, we're not to be unequally yoked with somebody.

984
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,140
 I mean, you can't, Kelly and I talked about this

985
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
 we have for years.

986
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,220
 It's just like we have a standard that we hold to

987
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,320
 and that's the word of God.

988
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:45,440
 We have a high priest, we have a mediator,

989
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,080
 we have Christ dwelling within us.

990
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,120
 And to spend a life with somebody

991
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,560
 who doesn't operate on the same plumb line,

992
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,880
 who doesn't have the same standard,

993
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,880
 because when I'm not loving Kelly well,

994
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,740
 which is often, she can hold me up to the standard

995
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,160
 that I know and that's Christ.

996
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,740
 And if you, I just don't, for me,

997
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,980
 if my wife didn't know the Lord,

998
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,100
 I just don't know what I would do.

999
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:22,600
 It would be because Christ teaches us how to forgive.

1000
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,860
 Christ teaches us how to love.

1001
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,580
 Christ teaches us how to abstain.

1002
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,880
 Christ teaches us how to speak.

1003
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,200
 I mean, the word of God in our hearts

1004
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,280
 and the spirit within us is the only way

1005
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,280
 that we have a chance to experience marriage

1006
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,640
 in the way that it was meant to be experienced.

1007
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,760
 I mean, you can have a friend.

1008
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,080
 I mean, we all know our friends who are married

1009
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,400
 and seem to have great relationships

1010
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,360
 that don't know the Lord.

1011
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,760
 I mean, people make it.

1012
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,520
 I'm not saying that they don't.

1013
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,500
 But to experience marriage the way that it was meant

1014
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:04,500
 to be created apart from the spirit of God is impossible.

1015
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,300
 I believe it's impossible.

1016
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:11,220
 And I just, I thank the Lord that I have a wife

1017
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,540
 who loves Jesus more than she loves me.

1018
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:18,440
 It's the greatest gift that I've ever been given.

1019
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,140
 And I hope that for all of you

1020
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,120
 because you've seen them go bad.

1021
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,520
 All of you have seen them go bad.

1022
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,160
 And without the standard of Christ in our life,

1023
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:36,200
 the chances are great, you know?

1024
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,880
 'Cause it's hard anyway.

1025
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,480
 That's the truth.

1026
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,560
 - That's really good.

1027
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,520
 Really, anything--

1028
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,920
 - And I would say just to the ladies that,

1029
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,260
 I mean, even in marriage, you know,

1030
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,540
 there are disappointments and we all come into marriage

1031
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:55,200
 thinking that it's one way and then the reality of marriage

1032
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,740
 is something totally different.

1033
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:02,740
 And it's better, but it's different than the expectations

1034
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,720
 that you project on this relationship

1035
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,320
 from the time that you're a little girl.

1036
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,360
 And the first year of our marriage,

1037
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,240
 at the end of the first year,

1038
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,240
 when we sat at Bob's Dickenshop house to celebrate,

1039
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,120
 I just was bawling.

1040
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,720
 I mean, just reality check.

1041
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,880
 I was bawling not because he's a bad husband

1042
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,520
 or wasn't what I thought he would be,

1043
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,760
 but because I was disappointed in the reality

1044
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,320
 of what marriage really looked like.

1045
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,760
 It was real and he was still the same person

1046
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,400
 and I was still the same person,

1047
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,320
 but it wasn't like all of our problems went away

1048
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,220
 and we just lived happily ever after.

1049
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:51,640
 You know, it was more like a mirror held up

1050
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,360
 to your selfishness.

1051
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,240
 And in dating and in engagement,

1052
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:01,440
 I thought I was the nicest person on earth

1053
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,860
 and I thought he was the sweetest,

1054
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:07,360
 most romantic, pursuing man on earth.

1055
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,800
 And then after a year of marriage, I was like,

1056
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,880
 oh, this is what it is.

1057
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,380
 Not in a bad way, but that's just the reality, you know,

1058
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,920
 and tagged onto that, I just wanna say that

1059
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,420
 because of the reality being better,

1060
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,780
 believing God's word to be true in the midst of going,

1061
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,060
 this doesn't feel better

1062
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,020
 than what I thought marriage would be,

1063
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:36,020
 that pressed me in to Jesus

1064
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,940
 and that pressed me into God's word

1065
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:40,260
 and I found some treasures there

1066
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,460
 that if he didn't know the Lord in the first place,

1067
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,300
 I couldn't cling to, which is where it says,

1068
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,140
 wives, submit to your husbands,

1069
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:53,140
 and it compares us to Christ submitting to the Lord

1070
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:56,460
 and it says, submit to your husband

1071
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,580
 so that if any of them, the husband,

1072
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,980
 is not obedient to the word,

1073
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,020
 which there'll be times when they're not,

1074
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:08,020
 if any of them are disobedient to the word,

1075
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:12,260
 you will win them over without a word

1076
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,540
 by your chaste and respectful behavior

1077
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,500
 and that was so powerful to me

1078
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,700
 because I realized that in my disappointments

1079
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,100
 or in the things that I saw in him,

1080
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,620
 that I was like, I didn't know this,

1081
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,060
 like, Lord, what am I supposed to do now?

1082
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,660
 He wasn't everything that I thought,

1083
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,740
 just like I'm not,

1084
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,260
 I wasn't the nicest person he thought either.

1085
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:39,380
 I realized I have an advocate in my marriage.

1086
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,620
 Like, the Lord can speak to him.

1087
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,420
 I don't have to be his boss.

1088
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,740
 I don't have to be his Holy Spirit

1089
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:52,620
 and I cannot tell you how many times at night

1090
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:57,980
 we lay in bed after I talk to a friend

1091
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,580
 that married an unbeliever

1092
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,740
 or there's just distress in marriage,

1093
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:05,980
 I say, Shane, I'm so thankful.

1094
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,100
 I'm so thankful that you love Jesus

1095
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,460
 and you're submitted to him

1096
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,020
 because it takes all the pressure off.

1097
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,180
 You don't have to marry the perfect person.

1098
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,900
 You don't have to be the perfect person

1099
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,740
 but if you're both, like JP said,

1100
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:24,340
 you're both pursuing Jesus,

1101
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:28,140
 then you have the same advocate who's for you

1102
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,460
 and when the person next to you

1103
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:34,140
 isn't doing what he's supposed to do,

1104
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,580
 this is what the word says you're supposed to do

1105
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,820
 and you're not doing it and that's not fair.

1106
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,660
 That's how I felt, like, wait a minute.

1107
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,860
 This wasn't what I signed up for.

1108
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:49,620
 Then I can go, oh, Jesus says I can win him over

1109
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,820
 without a word.

1110
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,460
 I don't have to be a knack.

1111
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,740
 I don't have to force him.

1112
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,380
 I can go to my advocate

1113
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:01,540
 and if you both don't know Jesus,

1114
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,740
 if you're in a relationship

1115
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:06,140
 or you're dating someone that doesn't know Jesus,

1116
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:10,260
 then that person doesn't have the same resources

1117
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,020
 that you do and you need to cut it off.

1118
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,620
 That's the most loving thing you can do

1119
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:18,140
 if you're in a relationship with an unbeliever.

1120
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:18,980
 - That'll preach. - It's break up.

1121
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,140
 - That'll preach, love it.

1122
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,940
 - Because that brokenness will lead them.

1123
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,740
 They'll see that they're broken

1124
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,020
 and that brokenness will lead them to Jesus

1125
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,860
 and if the Lord wants you to be married,

1126
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,300
 he can bring it back around

1127
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,940
 'cause we broke up and it was over

1128
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,980
 and the Lord brought it back around.

1129
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,820
 So that's all.

1130
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,300
 - I'll just say too, I don't know if you can,

1131
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,140
 it is like the greatest,

1132
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,100
 you've heard Shane say it

1133
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,660
 and I've heard JP say it personally to me several times,

1134
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:54,300
 but just to have someone who loves Jesus

1135
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,820
 more than they love you.

1136
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:58,340
 I mean, someone who loves Jesus

1137
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,620
 and who surrendered to Jesus,

1138
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,980
 there's just nothing greater

1139
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,860
 and if you're in a relationship,

1140
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,460
 we all know what it's like,

1141
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,860
 oh man, they've won my heart.

1142
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,620
 We all know that pull

1143
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,180
 when there's an attraction with somebody

1144
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,100
 and man, I can't do anything about it.

1145
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,820
 We just say maybe just don't trust your heart.

1146
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:20,900
 Inform your heart with the word of God

1147
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,580
 and with community, with a loving community

1148
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,540
 'cause it is almost impossible

1149
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,460
 to not follow your heart in those situations.

1150
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,380
 This situation that came in,

1151
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,700
 whoever you are, you're going,

1152
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,540
 I hear what you're saying,

1153
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:37,980
 but it's impossible for me to not want to love this person.

1154
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,340
 And I would just say, just don't follow your heart.

1155
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:44,340
 Your heart is wicked above everything else,

1156
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,300
 it says in Proverbs.

1157
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,420
 And so inform your heart with the word

1158
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:51,020
 and sometimes it just means doing what you don't want to do

1159
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,180
 and trusting that God is better.

1160
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,780
 - Love it.

1161
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,300
 Okay, so we'll do two more.

1162
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,380
 This one, I think you guys could speak to well.

1163
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,740
 It just talks about, there's been several that say,

1164
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:08,020
 how do you date and deal with your baggage

1165
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,060
 and when do you need to break up

1166
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:12,900
 because of the other baggage that a person is bringing in

1167
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,740
 or that you're bringing in as it kind of comes

1168
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:15,820
 to the surface?

1169
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,740
 And so what do you do with that?

1170
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,620
 Does it mean that you have to break up?

1171
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,580
 And how do you work through that?

1172
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:25,180
 - There was a message we did,

1173
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,660
 I think it's called Baggage Claim.

1174
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,380
 It was in Boy Meets Girl series

1175
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,420
 and I just share some of Monica and I's story.

1176
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,220
 But you have to deal with your baggage.

1177
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,940
 I mean, whatever, I've never met,

1178
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,580
 I mean, we meet with tons of single folks,

1179
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,260
 we'd meet with people who are engaged,

1180
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,740
 we'd meet with lots of married people.

1181
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,420
 I've never met with, I've said this before,

1182
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:44,100
 I've never met anyone with marriage problems.

1183
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,660
 There are always single problems brought into marriage.

1184
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,180
 And so you've got to, that baggage,

1185
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,580
 that thing that you're holding onto

1186
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,500
 that you're gonna try to hide,

1187
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,340
 that abortion, that rape, that abuse,

1188
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:00,980
 that pornography, that sexual promiscuity,

1189
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:05,980
 that homosexual tendency, that whatever that is,

1190
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,420
 that's gonna destroy your marriage

1191
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,940
 before you even meet the person you're going to marry.

1192
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,900
 So like in the future, like that's already done

1193
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,580
 until you have sought healing in that

1194
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,300
 and pursued Christ in that.

1195
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,580
 And so we're not up here like trying

1196
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,100
 to put a heavy yoke on you guys.

1197
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,700
 There's about 3,000 folks here.

1198
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,540
 Nothing would bring me more joy

1199
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,780
 than 1,500 healthy marriages, like nothing.

1200
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,660
 Like that would, like we talk about all the time

1201
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,500
 changing the world.

1202
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,900
 If there were 1,500 healthy marriages

1203
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,500
 that came out of tonight, right,

1204
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,540
 and I don't mean necessarily every boy and girl

1205
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,620
 just hooking up, you guys know what I mean.

1206
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:41,140
 But if there were 1,500 healthy marriages

1207
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,220
 that came out, I mean, we would change the world.

1208
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,180
 You would make disciples, your kids would grow up,

1209
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,420
 they'd have, I mean, you would change the legacy

1210
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,060
 of the brokenness in your family.

1211
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:52,380
 But you've got to start working on that now.

1212
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,100
 And so I would just say if you're in a relationship

1213
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:58,580
 and the path, the course you're on

1214
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,860
 is not dealing with the baggage

1215
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:02,060
 but continuing to fall into it, break up,

1216
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,620
 hey, get well, and like, hey, I'm enabling you,

1217
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,020
 so you go get well.

1218
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,580
 And then if the Lord brings us back together, great.

1219
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,180
 But I'm not counting on that.

1220
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,940
 I'm gonna go and I'm gonna pursue him

1221
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,420
 and you need to go and pursue him.

1222
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,180
 And I'm enabling you or causing you not to pursue him.

1223
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:18,260
 So this is over.

1224
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,460
 - And you're not gonna be the one

1225
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,820
 that's gonna change your boyfriend or girlfriend

1226
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:27,220
 or spouse, like it is the Lord who's gonna do that work.

1227
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:31,860
 And how great that if you realize that when you are single

1228
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:35,100
 that you're not in that marriage, thinking,

1229
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,420
 you know, or even praying.

1230
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,260
 I feel like one of the questions maybe was about,

1231
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:44,100
 just about praying for your spouse and what that looked like

1232
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:48,140
 and it's great, like to pray for them

1233
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:50,580
 to be who God wants them to be,

1234
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,780
 but not who you want them to be.

1235
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,540
 And you're just not the one that's gonna change them.

1236
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,900
 It's gonna be the Lord.

1237
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,060
 - That's excellent, excellent.

1238
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:01,260
 So there may be a scenario where they are in community

1239
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,700
 and their community is helping them work

1240
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,700
 through their baggage.

1241
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,820
 And honestly, their community may be better able

1242
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:10,620
 to speak into whether or not this is a deal breaker

1243
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,860
 or hey, you're healing.

1244
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,620
 - Yeah, community's gotta play, here it is.

1245
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:15,580
 Community's gotta play a role in that.

1246
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,940
 It's this simple.

1247
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,580
 People tell me all the time, I'm struggling with pornography.

1248
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,580
 I say all the time, no, you're not, you're not struggling.

1249
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,780
 You're just looking at porn.

1250
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,900
 That's different.

1251
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,020
 Like struggling looks like creating barricades

1252
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,020
 so that you can't get to it though you want to.

1253
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,260
 That's struggling.

1254
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,380
 Looking at it is different than struggling, okay?

1255
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:35,420
 And so if you're looking at it, break up.

1256
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,580
 If you're struggling well, you're building barricades,

1257
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,420
 you're not looking at it though you want to

1258
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,820
 and you're having God deal with that desire

1259
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,660
 and you're pursuing him and you're victorious

1260
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,580
 in your pursuit of him, awesome.

1261
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,380
 And so replace pornography with whatever is that struggle,

1262
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:52,380
 eating disorder, materialism, whatever it is.

1263
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,540
 I mean, if you're working and growing in that, great.

1264
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:58,940
 If you're not, there's no better time to work on that

1265
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:01,220
 and community's key, as David said.

1266
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,060
 - That's excellent.

1267
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:03,580
 So this will be the last question.

1268
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,940
 But really, all of these questions

1269
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,220
 can be answered in community.

1270
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,900
 I mean, a lot of them, there's no mystery or secret.

1271
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,580
 It's amazing and godly.

1272
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,300
 I know personally all of you to be.

1273
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,980
 A lot of these scripture can just address fairly clearly

1274
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,260
 and you guys don't have any secret keys or sauce

1275
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,100
 that allows you to do them.

1276
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,580
 So if you asked a question, we didn't answer it,

1277
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,460
 we would love to and we'd encourage you

1278
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,300
 to go to your community.

1279
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,820
 If you don't have one, we'd encourage you

1280
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,620
 to be plugged into a body and have community.

1281
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,660
 And so this question, there was a number of questions

1282
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:37,340
 that came in just about the crazy teaching last week

1283
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:41,060
 that was at the porch and this pastor who had gone rogue

1284
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:43,780
 up here and taught this ridiculous bomb

1285
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,460
 of a message on divorce.

1286
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,820
 And so JP, could you add any clarity

1287
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,940
 to just divorce, remarriage,

1288
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:54,820
 and what does the Bible say about it?

1289
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,980
 - We have removed him from, no.

1290
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,500
 (congregation laughing)

1291
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,940
 - This will be my last porch here.

1292
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,340
 - This is actually a farewell party.

1293
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,180
 I mean, here's what I would say.

1294
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,660
 I listened to the message yesterday.

1295
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:06,980
 I was so encouraged, bro.

1296
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,300
 So encouraged by the way you handled that text.

1297
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,580
 It's such a hard topic and people hate you for it, man.

1298
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,620
 I mean, they will.

1299
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:16,980
 No one likes to be told things different

1300
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,020
 than the desires of their heart.

1301
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:23,020
 And so that message, thank you for handling that well, yeah.

1302
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:28,460
 (congregation applauding)

1303
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,300
 - I mean, it was really hard.

1304
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,780
 It's been a hard week for our whole team

1305
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:32,780
 because of how much.

1306
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,740
 - Here's why, here's why it's been a hard week.

1307
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,660
 So we got lots of emails.

1308
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,360
 You quantified lots, like a dozen.

1309
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,940
 (congregation laughing)

1310
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,580
 And let me just say this real specific.

1311
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,420
 - Painful dozen.

1312
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,140
 - Let you into our world.

1313
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:47,660
 They're long emails.

1314
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,580
 You know why they're long?

1315
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,260
 Because everybody, and this is not a judgment.

1316
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,900
 So like if you sent that email, know that.

1317
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,840
 Like we love that you sent that email.

1318
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,600
 But I wanna give the rest of you a perspective

1319
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,740
 into those emails.

1320
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:02,140
 They're all long because everybody wants to tell you,

1321
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,140
 hey, this is my story.

1322
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,020
 And your story matters.

1323
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,980
 I want you to know that God cares about your story.

1324
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,420
 But what you're doing, you're justifying.

1325
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,380
 You're saying, hey, this is why.

1326
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,740
 Man, my husband was abusive.

1327
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,100
 My wife was abusive.

1328
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,580
 She cheated on me with my best friend.

1329
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:19,700
 Her and the pastor, you know, whatever that was, right?

1330
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,140
 And it's like, this is my story.

1331
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:22,860
 You don't understand.

1332
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:23,820
 This is my story.

1333
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,060
 You don't know what happened to me.

1334
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:26,900
 It's different.

1335
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:30,200
 And I would just say, God's so much bigger than that.

1336
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,620
 And what I heard David say, very appropriately,

1337
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,820
 and I support him 100% because he's teaching the Word.

1338
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,340
 And a lot of people, like people wrote in,

1339
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,980
 like what's Watermark's real stance on divorce?

1340
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,700
 It's like, well, it's just the Bible.

1341
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,900
 Like, Watermark's stance is just what the Scripture says.

1342
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,060
 It's not that Watermark's stance, it's the Bible's stance.

1343
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:47,900
 You know?

1344
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,260
 There's not like this unique, and yeah,

1345
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:51,180
 not all churches are going to teach that.

1346
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,580
 You're gonna have churches that have said,

1347
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:56,620
 hey, bought into cultural, have a cultural worldview.

1348
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:01,020
 But here's what I would say, is you've gotta ask the question.

1349
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,540
 What I heard David appropriately say,

1350
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,140
 is you need to wrestle with this.

1351
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:07,060
 So if divorce is a part of your story,

1352
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,560
 you more than anybody else should be an expert

1353
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,620
 on what the Scriptures say about it.

1354
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,500
 And so wrestle with those Scriptures,

1355
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,860
 because the Scriptures have a lot to say about it.

1356
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:19,500
 In Matthew 19, Matthew 5, 1 Corinthians 7.

1357
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,860
 We have a lot of Scriptures to inform

1358
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,200
 our idea of what that looks like.

1359
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,340
 I believe David handled that text really, really well.

1360
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,140
 And so what happened is some of you heard,

1361
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,060
 I need to go and reconcile to my spouse

1362
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:35,180
 who was abusive and crazy and Satan himself in the flesh.

1363
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:38,540
 And I would say, I want you to understand

1364
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:42,780
 that the only options are not divorce or be abused.

1365
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,900
 Those are not the only options.

1366
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,500
 I mean, and so nobody, it is not God's desire

1367
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,620
 that you would be in an abusive relationship.

1368
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:50,920
 That is not God's desire.

1369
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,220
 But it may be God's desire to save your abuser.

1370
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,340
 I was an abuser, okay?

1371
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,340
 I was an abuser, like that's my, I mean,

1372
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:02,220
 I was an adulterer in the form that I was a sex addict,

1373
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,140
 looking at porn all the time,

1374
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,860
 verbally abusive, playing mind games with her.

1375
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,780
 I mean, I was that person.

1376
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,740
 And the Lord changed me, and so whoever you were,

1377
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:11,740
 God is big enough.

1378
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:14,500
 So you ask yourself this hypothetical question.

1379
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:18,100
 What could bring God the most glory?

1380
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,540
 And I promise you, you show me the most wicked,

1381
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,220
 evil man in the world, and I'll show you God,

1382
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,660
 someone who God can take and make a missionary out of.

1383
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:26,860
 See, also the Apostle Paul,

1384
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:30,940
 who killed Christians, women, and children, okay?

1385
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,380
 And so I'm just, we're just,

1386
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,260
 we're not trying to put a heavy yoke on you.

1387
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,340
 We're saying, hey, as you pursue God's best,

1388
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:38,500
 you're going to win.

1389
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:43,500
 God's best is your best, all day, every day, I promise you.

1390
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,740
 And so I know that that's frustrating.

1391
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:47,260
 I know that you hear that, and we,

1392
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,140
 David, I know you've had some great meetings with folks.

1393
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,420
 I mean, some of you, I'm so proud of you.

1394
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:53,060
 I mean, some, there were folks who were angry,

1395
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,140
 and then we met, and it was just like, you know what?

1396
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,100
 I'm gonna start praying for my ex-husband.

1397
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,020
 I'm gonna start praying for my ex-wife.

1398
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,860
 I'm gonna start praying the Lord would save 'em,

1399
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,300
 and change their hearts.

1400
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,020
 And I think God is up in heaven,

1401
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:08,460
 saying that's what honors me, and that honors me.

1402
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:10,020
 And so just wrestle with the text.

1403
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,820
 If you, if divorce is a part of your story,

1404
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,660
 you should be an expert on the topic.

1405
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,780
 I'm going to go ahead and tell you.

1406
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,860
 There are tons of churches that would just say,

1407
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,860
 oh yeah, no big deal, divorce, no big deal.

1408
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,620
 And I'm just, I'm telling you as lovingly as I can,

1409
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,540
 it's just not what the Bible says.

1410
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:27,100
 It's just not what God says, so.

1411
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,740
 - And that's, what you just said, though,

1412
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:31,380
 is maybe the first step in pursuing reconciliation.

1413
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:34,420
 I think a lot of people who had an abusive relationship

1414
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:37,260
 heard you need to pursue reconciliation,

1415
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,900
 is we're telling them to walk back into an abusive,

1416
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,580
 violent, and we're just saying, hey,

1417
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:44,280
 that may look like praying, God, save him,

1418
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,660
 while I stay physically separated from him.

1419
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,260
 - Pray for them, be in community,

1420
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,940
 have your community speak into this.

1421
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:52,580
 I mean, it's not, we would not advise you to leave here

1422
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,220
 and run back to that abuser and say,

1423
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,980
 hey, I'm here, I'm back, you know.

1424
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,780
 That's not the counsel.

1425
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:01,020
 And so be wise in that, and if we can speak more,

1426
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,020
 if we can speak more clarity into that,

1427
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,260
 just know that we're willing to, we'd love to, okay?

1428
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,300
 And we know that everybody's story's unique,

1429
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,660
 and we can imagine, we can think with our minds,

1430
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,900
 but here's the absolute worst case scenario.

1431
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,480
 You're not gonna surprise us.

1432
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,760
 You know, my husband was a murderer and crazy,

1433
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,900
 and he lied to me, he was a con artist,

1434
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,700
 and I would say, man, out of everybody in the world,

1435
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,680
 you chose that one, and so we just need to think through

1436
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,100
 what God would do now or could do now

1437
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,580
 to bring glory to himself.

1438
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:29,760
 I'm not trying to make you feel guilty.

1439
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,900
 There's no guilt here.

1440
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,620
 I'm just saying, let's follow the Spirit

1441
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,380
 and see what God could be doing,

1442
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,260
 what he might be up to, 'cause I've seen him

1443
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:37,940
 do some crazy things.

1444
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:41,420
 He took this sex addict, crazy fool,

1445
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:42,660
 and made him a pastor.

1446
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,820
 Not that that's the end all, be all,

1447
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,140
 and he's still at work in my heart,

1448
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:49,220
 but he can do some crazy, crazy things.

1449
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:51,980
 And so, I'll just wrap this up.

1450
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,620
 I'll say this.

1451
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,300
 Thank you guys for being here

1452
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,060
 and just sharing wisdom with us.

1453
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:00,220
 (audience applauding)

1454
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:06,060
 I remember, if you've been with us for a while,

1455
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:09,420
 you've heard this story, but I remember our wedding day,

1456
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:14,420
 and it was 2004, and I remember being up there.

1457
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:17,860
 I love Jesus.

1458
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:21,540
 She came down the aisle, and I just was like,

1459
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,740
 man, I got the prize.

1460
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:27,860
 And the guy up there, we read some scriptures to each other.

1461
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:29,780
 We talked about how much we love God

1462
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:30,620
 and how much we love each other.

1463
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,740
 And I remember, you may kiss your bride,

1464
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:35,060
 and they played that music, and we walked down the foyer

1465
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:37,540
 at Truett Seminary there on Baylor's campus.

1466
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:38,980
 And we were sitting in the foyer,

1467
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,500
 and I held you in my arms,

1468
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:43,500
 and I remember praying over us, and just where I was,

1469
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,940
 and I remember praying specifically,

1470
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:47,220
 Lord, thank you so much that you allowed me

1471
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,420
 to escape the consequences of my sin.

1472
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:53,360
 God, I mean, just how merciful are you

1473
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,500
 that you allowed me to escape the consequences of my sin?

1474
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,540
 And specifically, I was thinking like a child

1475
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:02,220
 without a wedlock or an STD or a psycho ex-girlfriend

1476
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:03,460
 waiting to kill me outside.

1477
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,940
 Like, those were the things that were going through my mind.

1478
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,500
 And I was just like, you know, there's none of these things.

1479
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,940
 Like, God, I win, you know?

1480
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,220
 Your grace is enough, and your grace is sufficient.

1481
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:14,740
 And we got into two years of marriage,

1482
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:18,860
 and I realized how messed up I was because of my past.

1483
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,340
 And like, I had no idea how to love this woman.

1484
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:22,900
 I had no idea.

1485
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:23,940
 I didn't know the first thing.

1486
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,940
 I never, I had, I mean, I had every relationship

1487
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:27,780
 I'd ever been in.

1488
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,100
 I broke up as soon as it went south

1489
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,420
 and jumped into another one.

1490
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:31,660
 I was so codependent.

1491
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:34,940
 And now I'm in this covenant relationship with her,

1492
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:37,980
 with God, and I have no idea how to be here.

1493
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:39,220
 And it was a complete mess,

1494
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:41,500
 and the divorce word was being thrown around,

1495
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,340
 and we were fighting all the time.

1496
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:47,100
 And I mean, it was absolute torturous misery.

1497
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,220
 I mean, me, not even her, me.

1498
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:52,100
 I mean, we're both broken, but mostly me.

1499
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:56,220
 And so I want you to know

1500
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,540
 that you're not getting away with it.

1501
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,420
 No one does.

1502
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:01,220
 You're not getting away with it.

1503
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:02,660
 And I don't say that so that you feel guilty.

1504
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:03,820
 I say that because there's nothing

1505
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:05,500
 that would bring me more honor.

1506
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,420
 There's nothing that would bring me more joy

1507
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:10,180
 than 1,500 healthy marriages walking out of this room.

1508
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:13,340
 And it's game time, folks.

1509
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,460
 This was a fun series.

1510
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:17,460
 It's time to pursue God with all your lives.

1511
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,500
 We will change this world if you do that.

1512
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:22,180
 We will wreck shop in this place.

1513
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,780
 God will change this world through you.

1514
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,580
 But there is some growing up that has to do,

1515
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:29,340
 that has to happen.

1516
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:31,820
 And so bring him your junk right now.

1517
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:32,740
 I don't care who you are.

1518
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:34,300
 I don't care what you've done.

1519
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:35,500
 He can handle it.

1520
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,460
 You bring it to him right now.

1521
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:37,620
 You say, God, I'm done.

1522
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,300
 Man, I know that I have not been respectful

1523
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,900
 and honorable to your daughter, my sister,

1524
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,900
 who you told me is like my sister.

1525
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,660
 I know that I have not fleed sexual immorality.

1526
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,860
 God, I know that I am a codependent.

1527
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:51,180
 Lord, I know that I have been promiscuously,

1528
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,700
 I have been promiscuous with my words and my heart,

1529
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:58,260
 maybe not even sexually, maybe not even physically,

1530
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,820
 but I have let my heart drift.

1531
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:01,660
 I've been in an imaginary relationship with,

1532
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:03,780
 God, I know I've sinned against you in these ways.

1533
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,820
 Father, would you fix this?

1534
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,540
 And if you're not in community, get in community.

1535
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:08,700
 That's key.

1536
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,860
 And begin to confess your sins

1537
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,060
 and watch him change your life.

1538
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:14,500
 He did that for us.

1539
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,520
 I know he did that for you guys.

1540
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,980
 And I know you guys have always been holy,

1541
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:20,060
 so we're glad you're here.

1542
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,340
 - No, the toe thing.

1543
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:22,660
 You didn't hear about the toe thing?

1544
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:23,740
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

1545
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,220
 And we do need to-- - And we champion.

1546
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:26,700
 - We do need to talk about that toe thing.

1547
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,500
 That was off script, Shane.

1548
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,420
 - Beat it dirty.

1549
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:32,260
 - Hey, but we love you guys.

1550
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,100
 Let me pray.

1551
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:35,980
 And after we pray, you guys do a song

1552
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,700
 and we'll just close and end in worship.

1553
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:38,700
 Is that cool?

1554
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:39,980
 Okay.

1555
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:40,820
 Father, we do.

1556
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:46,980
 But I pray that everyone here that desires a spouse,

1557
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,380
 Lord, that we would give them one.

1558
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,420
 Someone who loves them,

1559
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,180
 someone who loves you more than them.

1560
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:55,540
 And Father, before you do,

1561
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,340
 would you make them someone who loves you

1562
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:01,180
 more than they love their spouse?

1563
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:05,220
 And Father, there's some folks here,

1564
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:06,420
 we've been saying some crazy things

1565
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:07,740
 and Jesus was thrown out a lot.

1566
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,380
 And there's people here that don't know

1567
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,460
 you through your son.

1568
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:12,720
 Lord, would you save them?

1569
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,980
 Father, would your spirit convict hearts,

1570
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:20,420
 folks who slept with someone last night or this weekend,

1571
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:23,340
 and someone who looked at porn yesterday.

1572
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:26,500
 Lord, would your spirit just,

1573
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,740
 would you just give them a new heart?

1574
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:30,620
 There's no, listen, Christ died for that.

1575
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:34,500
 You don't, you tell us in Paul's letter to the Corinthians

1576
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,220
 that you're no longer counting our sins against us.

1577
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:38,460
 How crazy is that?

1578
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,380
 It's incredible.

1579
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:42,980
 So Lord, thank you just for the way that you love us.

1580
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,820
 Thank you for the son that you gave for us.

1581
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:48,540
 Thank you for the things you've done for us.

1582
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,660
 And Lord, we'd love to sing to you

1583
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:51,620
 and pray that you'd be honored.

1584
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:53,180
 I pray that our lives would be songs to you,

1585
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:55,420
 but right now we just wanna sing to you.

1586
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:56,620
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1587
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:00,200
 (congregation applauding)

1588
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,780
 (upbeat music)

1589
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:12,780
