[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.020]   - Love it, welcome friends in the room
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.060]   and friends in Fort Worth and in Houston
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.460]   and friends just joining us from wherever you are at.
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.300]   How y'all doing?
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.460]   What a March Madness bracket busting weekend.
[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.340]   Hey, I don't know if you had a chance
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.020]   to be a part of anything related
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.240]   to the past weekend's holiday.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.500]   Anyone celebrate, you know what holiday it was?
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.300]   St. Patrick's Day.
[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.020]   What a weird holiday.
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.980]   Can I get an amen for some?
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.020]   I mean, and maybe it doesn't seem weird at all to you
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.420]   and just the green beer feels normal
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.260]   and pinching people wherever that thing comes from
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.180]   and wearing green and celebrating the Irish
[00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.220]   and having horrible traffic if you live anywhere
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.660]   near Greenville around here.
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.820]   But what becomes increasingly weird
[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.060]   is if you compare it to the original purpose
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.740]   of that holiday, which is St. Patrick.
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.300]   And I don't know if you know the story of St. Patrick,
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.340]   but it has nothing to do with green beer
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.380]   or anything like that.
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.200]   St. Patrick was a guy who really lived a remarkable life
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.500]   that God used to transform an entire country.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.500]   St. Patrick, or Patrick, was born around 400 years AD
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.900]   or 1600 years ago.
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.420]   He was a guy that lived, he wasn't even Irish.
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.340]   He was born in Great Britain and around the age of 40,
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.880]   he got a vision from the Lord, he would say,
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.420]   that he felt like Jesus was calling him
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.180]   to go to the nation, or to the island of Ireland.
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.020]   It wasn't even a nation at the time.
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.260]   It was just a bunch of like pagan different people groups
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.900]   running around and around 400 AD.
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.120]   And he got a vision that God wanted him to go over there
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.980]   and to share the message of Jesus with these people.
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.260]   He felt like he was called to go over there.
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.420]   And so he goes over there, and for three decades,
[00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.660]   he goes all throughout the nation,
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.860]   and he teaches and invites these Irish people groups,
[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.040]   these pagan Irish people, to come to know the one true God
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.040]   and to come to know Jesus.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.300]   And he leads thousands and thousands of people to Christ.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.380]   One historian said that when he arrived in Ireland,
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.860]   he found it entirely pagan, but when he was done,
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.020]   he found it and left it entirely Christian.
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.920]   He truly transformed this entire nation.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.520]   He risked his life over and over and over again.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.660]   I mean, he's an amazing guy that God used
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.180]   to really spark a crazy revival, widespread revival,
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.340]   all throughout the nation.
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.280]   And for 30 years, he led over 160,000,
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.840]   think about this, his ministry,
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.240]   160,000 people to Christ.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.400]   He started 300 churches all over Ireland.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.200]   And here's what happened next,
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.380]   is God didn't just use him to change Ireland.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.200]   What happened is all of the kind of Christian converts,
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.560]   or conversion converts, there we go,
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.960]   to Christianity that were a part of kind of his lineage
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.780]   ended up going back to Great Britain,
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.720]   which had been run over by pagan ritualistic
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.260]   and nature worship and all kinds of stuff,
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.120]   and ended up transforming the nation
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.960]   of Great Britain as well.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.580]   God used this man in an incredible way.
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.600]   And it has nothing to do with any of the ways
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.940]   that we celebrate him today.
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.320]   Now it's just an excuse to get hammered on Saturday
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.680]   and feel okay about it, 'cause it's one day a week.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.760]   And one day a year.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.960]   And it has nothing to do with the incredible life
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.560]   that this man that God used to transform a country.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.920]   Even the shamrock, or the three-leaf clover.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.480]   One of the reasons that's associated with St. Patrick
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.400]   is because he would use those shamrocks,
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.480]   the three-leaf clovers, are all over Ireland,
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.520]   if you've been there.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.120]   And he would use those to explain the Trinity.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.760]   It's not the perfect illustration for the Trinity,
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.600]   but he would go around and say,
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.920]   hey, this is kind of what God is like.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.600]   He's three in one, it's one leaf,
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.000]   but it has three parts to it,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.280]   and just like Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.120]   He used that, and it ended up being a part
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.000]   of leading thousands and thousands and thousands
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.840]   of people to Christ.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.200]   There's even historians, if you're a history nerd,
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.760]   who would say that the Irish people
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.580]   were a part of really saving Western civilization
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.480]   from being overrun by all these kind of like
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.800]   nature worshipers at that time.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.840]   Just point being, he was a man that God used
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.280]   in an incredible, incredible way.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.160]   And I think the reason I start there
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.360]   is for most of us in the room,
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.200]   we all come in here tonight,
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.380]   and I think there's part of us
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.280]   that wants to live a life of purpose.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.600]   Whether or not we even realize it,
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.260]   or we would have even said that when we walked in,
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.160]   we all, at the end of our days,
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.960]   wanna come to a place where we have lived a life
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.880]   that mattered to someone.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.840]   We all wanna do something significant for God.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.680]   And here's how I know that.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.120]   In other words, no one came in here tonight
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.040]   and is like, you know what I want?
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.920]   At the end of my life, what they write on my tombstone
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.640]   is this guy really didn't do anything that mattered ever.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.240]   And the world's probably better off without him here.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.600]   That's just not something that any of us
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.960]   strive for or desire to have.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.220]   We all wanna be used by God in a significant way,
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.280]   or we all, at least, even if we wouldn't say that,
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.160]   we wanna live a life that matters.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.120]   And what we're gonna see tonight
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.600]   is that the type of life that matters
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.280]   is the life that God uses for his purposes,
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.920]   for significant things for his kingdom,
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.600]   just like St. Patrick was someone
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.320]   who God used in this incredible way.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.720]   We're gonna look at the story in Jonah chapter three,
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.700]   and we're gonna see what exactly is the type of person
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.900]   that God uses in an incredible way.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.340]   Because all of us, the good news is,
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.040]   come in and we all have the opportunity,
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.160]   as we're gonna see tonight, to be a part
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.600]   of being used by God in significant ways
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.200]   and to do the simple things that are required
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.480]   in order to be used by God.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.760]   So tonight, we're talking about the type of person
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.920]   that God uses, the type of person that God uses.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.320]   So we're gonna be in Jonah chapter three.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.960]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open in Jonah chapter three.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.120]   Like I said a couple weeks ago,
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.560]   probably the best bet if you wanna find the book of Jonah
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.600]   is to go to the front and use that table of contents,
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.160]   or you're gonna be spending for a while.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.200]   And so once you find it, go to chapter three.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.320]   If you don't have a Bible, there is a number
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.520]   of free Bibles in the welcome center outside of this room.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.840]   For you, if you're in Fort Worth,
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.640]   Garrett will let you know where those are,
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.900]   and there's also Bible apps, and it'll be on the screen.
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.920]   So we're gonna pick it up in verse one.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.920]   As we recap, let me recap a little bit
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.140]   what's going on with Jonah.
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.600]   So if you're just joining us, we've been in this
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.440]   for the past couple weeks.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.680]   Jonah is a guy who was famous because he was swallowed
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.420]   by a whale, great fish, big fish is officially the term.
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.600]   But he was swallowed by a fish,
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.240]   but he's a guy that God called around 750 BC.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.200]   So God shows up to the nation of Israel,
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.280]   and he goes to this guy named Jonah,
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.000]   and he says, "You're gonna be my prophet.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.680]   "You're gonna speak to the people on behalf of me,
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.560]   "God, at this time."
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.600]   The Old Testament is essentially about the story
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   of God's people, that's the nation of Israel.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.800]   Old Testament, first half, that's what your Bible's about,
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.160]   God's relationship with the Old Testament,
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.660]   with the nation of Israel.
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.600]   And he would speak to the people through prophets.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.380]   And a prophet was just somebody that he said,
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.520]   "Hey, they don't have Bibles,
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.880]   "so I'm gonna speak to them through you."
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.880]   And you may be going like, "Wait, what?
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.720]   "He would do that?
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.560]   "I mean, couldn't the guy just say, 'God was speaking to me'?
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.520]   "If you were a prophet on God's behalf,
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.600]   "and you prophesied or said something
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.720]   "on behalf of the Lord, and it didn't come true, you died."
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.920]   So it wasn't exactly the occupation that everyone was like,
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.160]   "Yeah, I wanna be a prophet,
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.200]   "and if it doesn't come true, you guys kill me."
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.840]   That wasn't really something that people dreamed of doing,
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.640]   so it wasn't something that lots of people did.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.840]   But God raised up these prophets, and one of them was Jonah.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.160]   And God comes to Jonah and says,
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.580]   "Hey, I have a very special mission for you.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.660]   "You're not gonna be just the prophet to my people,
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.600]   "you're gonna be the prophet to the nation of Assyria,
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.240]   "or to the capital of Assyria named Nineveh."
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.840]   Now, what does it have to do with anything?
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.160]   Here's what you gotta know about Nineveh.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.100]   Nineveh was not a good place.
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.720]   It was not the place that you wanted to go on vacation to,
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.840]   it was not a place that you wanted to spend a lot of time.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.720]   It was the capital of the cruelest army,
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.520]   or the cruelest people in the ancient world.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.320]   The Ninevites were not good people.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.120]   They are the great, great, great grandparents,
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.520]   as we said, of Isis.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.960]   And they make Isis honestly look like the Girl Scouts,
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.320]   or something, like Grandma's Bingo Club.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.040]   That's how tame it looks like to be a part of Isis,
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.960]   compared to the Ninevites.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.920]   They had mastered how to skin people alive.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.680]   They literally said, "We're gonna specialize in cruelty
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.720]   "and make everyone in the world afraid of us."
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.320]   So whenever they took over a city,
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.340]   they would take all the men,
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.880]   they would decapitate their heads,
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.000]   and put 'em in big piles outside of the city.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.560]   Then they would take the women and children sometimes,
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.040]   and just burn 'em alive, and say,
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.120]   "If you mess with us, this is what happens."
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.840]   They were not the people that you wanted
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.260]   to have God come to you and say,
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.280]   "I have a mission for you.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.920]   "I'd like you to go and tell Isis
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.640]   "that they need to all turn to God right now,
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.960]   "or they're all gonna go to hell."
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.800]   That wasn't exactly the message that you wanted to go,
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.280]   if God showed up to you, and it wasn't what Jonah wanted.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.500]   So Jonah says, after God asks him,
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.940]   "Hey, you're gonna go to Nineveh,
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.040]   "and you're gonna be a preacher to the Ninevites."
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.660]   He says, "I'd like to not do that.
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.040]   "You're breaking up, can't hear you great."
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.800]   And he takes off.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.000]   And God says, "Hey, you're going to be a part of this."
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.480]   And as the story, if you missed it,
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:50.040]   he gets on a boat, he ends up getting swallowed by a whale,
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.300]   the first Uber, we said, and God brings him back,
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.160]   and he says, "You're going to Nineveh."
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.300]   And so where we pick up this week, after last week,
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.740]   is that last week Jonah essentially cried out and said,
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.220]   "Lord, I surrender, I submit."
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.760]   And so now we're gonna pick up the story
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.880]   where God again says, "You're gonna go to Nineveh."
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.780]   So this is verse one of chapter three.
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:15.620]   "Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time.
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.600]   "Go to the great city of Nineveh,
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.120]   "and proclaim to it the message that I give you."
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.640]   Jonah obeyed the word of the Lord, and he went to Nineveh.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.500]   I just wanna stop right here and look at the first point,
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.200]   the first criteria, the first thing that's involved
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.040]   when God uses a person, that when God uses someone,
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.920]   he uses them despite their past.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.880]   It says that the word of the Lord
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.880]   came to Jonah for a second time,
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.080]   that God is a God of second chances,
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.400]   that God didn't give up on Jonah despite his disobedience,
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.160]   despite the fact that he ran, that God decided,
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.020]   "Hey, I'm gonna use you for something significant.
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.200]   "We're gonna see you in a second."
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.360]   Jonah ends up leading the greatest revival
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.440]   we know of in the entire Bible.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.260]   And he was the guy who said,
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.560]   "I don't wanna be a part of it, I'm not gonna obey you."
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.840]   And God came to him again,
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.400]   that God is a God of second chances, of third chances,
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.140]   of fourth chances, of fifth chances.
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.220]   Despite Jonah's past, despite his rebellion,
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.620]   God did not give up on him.
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.620]   God is a God who uses people despite their past,
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.500]   that if you and I will just surrender to him,
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.100]   whatever your story is,
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.900]   there's no telling what God can do with your life.
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.060]   What does it take in order to be someone that God's used?
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.540]   Do you have to have a perfect track record?
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.780]   Do you have to be kind of the person
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.980]   who has everything all together,
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.740]   has had everything all together in your life?
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.740]   No, the story of the Bible, the story of Jonah,
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.540]   is the story that God uses broken, messed up people
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.740]   who just surrender and cry out to him,
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.740]   who just surrender their life to him,
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.460]   not people with a perfect past.
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:42.300]   Whatever you think in this room disqualifies you
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.100]   from being someone who lives an incredible life
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.300]   that God uses.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.620]   It's not an obstacle for God,
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.420]   it usually is like the opportunity that God uses
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.660]   to say, "Man, that's a part of your story,
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.060]   "you're gonna be a minister to men and women,
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.580]   "or men or women who have that as a part of their story."
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.580]   If your legacy includes, man, a past abortion,
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.340]   maybe you have been in a same-sex relationship for a while,
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.180]   maybe you're someone who's gotten caught gambling
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.220]   or stealing at work,
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.820]   maybe you're someone who struggles with alcoholism
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.300]   or addiction of different kinds,
[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.220]   you'll probably end up being a pastor,
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.020]   especially if you hang around with God's people long enough.
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.220]   That's just how God works, that's what he does.
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.820]   Whatever your story is in the room,
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.660]   you are not too far from the grace of God
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.660]   to be used for an incredible purpose,
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.300]   to be used in incredible ways through him.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.340]   That's just what God does over and over throughout the Bible.
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.340]   God uses people despite their past.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.940]   Maybe you got pregnant at an early age,
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.660]   or maybe you got pregnant just outside of marriage,
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.860]   and you're like, "Can God really, can he really use me?
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.660]   "I feel like I'm damaged goods."
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.740]   The message of Jonah, the message of the Bible in general
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.180]   is that God uses broken people over and over and over again,
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.580]   whatever your story is.
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:54.820]   Maybe your story is just filled with pain from decisions
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.900]   that you didn't even make,
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.540]   but you grew up in a dysfunctional home,
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.340]   you didn't have two parents around.
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.980]   Maybe your story's like mine,
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.820]   where I can be tempted to believe that God can't use,
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.260]   it's like, "Man, I grew up without a dad around.
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.620]   "I got father wounds that I still have to fight
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.940]   "and work through, and Lord, I don't wanna do anything
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.940]   "as a result of just trying to fill some void in me
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.300]   "'cause I didn't have a dad around."
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.980]   I can be tempted by the lie that, man, God uses people,
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.900]   he uses people that come from pretty stories
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.340]   and Christian families and really godly parents,
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.180]   and those are the people that God's gonna do great things,
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.460]   that's who God does great things with.
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:30.580]   And then I read the Bible, and I see stories of men
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.420]   like Abraham and David, Abraham, who was Abraham?
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.780]   Abraham, the father of our faith.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.700]   Abraham was not exactly like the poster child of like,
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.020]   "Man, that guy's amazing."
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.580]   Abraham pimped out his wife multiple times.
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.420]   I think we would all agree,
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.740]   at least once is probably bad enough,
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.140]   and God's like, "Hey, you're gonna be
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.740]   "the father of the faith.
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.100]   "You're gonna be the guy that I use in incredible ways."
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.980]   Samson, Samson's a guy who, I mean,
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.380]   if you know anything about the story of Samson,
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.580]   Samson had a soft spot for the ladies,
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.460]   and he over and over and over again,
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.740]   I mean, even towards the end,
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.780]   he gets caught with his girl Delilah,
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.180]   who's not his wife, who he's staying at her house,
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.260]   and God is just incredible in his grace,
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.100]   uses this person.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.780]   The Bible is not a book full of just good stories
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.340]   about good people who have it all together.
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:17.220]   It's a story of the God who's there,
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.700]   who takes broken people and will use them
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.940]   if they will just surrender their life to him.
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.860]   And he uses them despite their past.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:25.740]   Let me say one further,
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.420]   'cause I know there's people in this room,
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:32.420]   you think that you have messed up too bad
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.020]   for God to write an amazing story in your life.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.900]   I've got family members who think,
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:43.900]   "Man, a godly guy could never love a girl like me.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.340]   "I mean, look what I've done.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.380]   "Everything in my rear view mirror is all jacked up.
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.620]   "I mean, the porch is great,
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.540]   "and that's all good for pretty people
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:51.380]   "who have their life together,
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.620]   "but godly guys are not gonna like a girl like me."
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.740]   Do you know what, if you believe that,
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:55.940]   do you know what your biggest obstacle
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:00.340]   to experiencing a story where God can write
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.740]   an amazing marriage and future and all of that into it,
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.580]   if that's what he has for you,
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.500]   your biggest obstacle is you,
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.700]   because you're buying the lie
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.740]   that your past is a problem for God's grace.
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.380]   It is a platform for his grace, if you will let it be.
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.660]   And whatever story you have is a story
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.820]   that God wants to use to minister
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:19.660]   to other people around you.
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.220]   He does not use perfect people.
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.060]   He uses people despite their past,
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.260]   whatever your story is.
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.780]   Let me just give you some examples,
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.020]   'cause maybe you're like, "Dude, I don't know if you know.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.620]   "You don't know what I've done, man."
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.940]   You must be new here,
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.540]   because let me go through what Watermark staff,
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.460]   let me just give you some of the stories
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.700]   from Watermark staff around here.
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.020]   Here's who's on staff at Watermark.
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.300]   This is just our church staff.
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.780]   We have porn addicts who are pastors.
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.860]   We have potheads who are pastors, formerly.
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.500]   We have alcoholics, adulteresses, cocaine dealers,
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.940]   heroin addict, eating disorders,
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.140]   people with abortions, multiple abortions
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:51.980]   inside of their past,
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.420]   people who lived for years and years
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.980]   in the same-sex community or in a gay relationship,
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.260]   prideful, self-righteous, arrogant people,
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.100]   people, whatever your story is,
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.180]   it's not something outside of the bounds of God's grace.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.220]   If you will just turn to him, he can do something amazing.
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.500]   If the greatest missionary the world will ever see
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.420]   is sitting inside of this room,
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.740]   the next Billy Graham is sitting inside this room,
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.740]   it would not surprise me at all.
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.260]   If they were leading the charge,
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.300]   hammered on Greenville this past Saturday,
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.300]   that's just what God does.
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.460]   He captures people and uses them despite their story.
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.380]   Whatever your story is, it is not a problem for God's grace,
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.620]   but it can be a platform for it.
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:39.100]   And Jonah obeyed the Lord and came for a second time.
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.020]   When he came for a second time,
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.500]   and he turned and he went to Nineveh.
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.220]   God further uses just some of the ins and outs
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.580]   of Jonah's story, which is what he's doing in your life.
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.340]   Like he's gonna take the things at your job,
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.620]   the circumstances in your life,
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.420]   and he is going to use those for future opportunities
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.980]   where you're gonna share and be able to relate to people.
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.020]   You're gonna come from a broken home,
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:57.900]   you're gonna be able to minister
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:58.940]   to people from a broken home.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.500]   An abortion may be a part of your past,
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.620]   you may be an incredible minister
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:03.940]   for the sake of the gospel.
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.060]   To other people who have that as a part of their story,
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.380]   he just weaves those things.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.100]   You know what is crazy about the story of Jonah?
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.500]   Jonah is swallowed up by a great fish,
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.660]   is what the Bible says to us,
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.660]   and God sends him to a city called Nineveh,
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.300]   and he's clearly at work, even in the details
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.340]   of you're gonna be swallowed by a fish.
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.180]   Why do I say that?
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.900]   Do you know what Nineveh, the derivative
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.780]   of where that word comes from?
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.820]   It means house of the fish, it means great fish.
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.140]   That's what the word Nineveh means.
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.300]   If you show like the calligraphy
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.300]   for what the word Nineveh is,
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.180]   it's literally a fish with a house around it.
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.260]   That's what Nineveh means.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.500]   And you know what the god
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.220]   that the people of Nineveh worshiped was?
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.620]   The fish god, a god named Dagon.
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:45.700]   Think about that.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:46.820]   That is crazy.
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.860]   God's gonna go, hey, look,
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.300]   these people that worship the fish,
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.660]   this is him, that's him, it's like Merman.
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.860]   And God's gonna say, hey, I'm gonna take you,
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.180]   and I'm gonna bring you all the way
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.340]   to these Ninevites who worship a fish god,
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.700]   who mean the house of the fish,
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.020]   and they're not gonna be introduced to a man god,
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.580]   or a man that's half fish, half god.
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.660]   They're gonna be introduced to the one true living God,
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.780]   and they're gonna be introduced to him
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.100]   through a man who's swallowed by a fish.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.340]   You think that that got their ears?
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.860]   This dude just was living in a fish for three days?
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.540]   We worship that guy?
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.660]   I'm listening.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.900]   That's exactly what God did,
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.020]   because God uses the stories that he's writing in your life,
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.660]   even stories filled with pain,
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:25.420]   stories filled with just consequences for our own sin.
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.540]   And when we just hand them over to him,
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.340]   he will write an amazing story
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.420]   to minister to the world around us.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.500]   That's the first quality of the person that God uses.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.340]   He uses people despite their past
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.980]   when they surrender to him.
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.900]   So Jonah goes, and he begins to head towards Nineveh,
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.180]   and he arrives at Nineveh, and here's what we're told.
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.620]   Verse three.
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.820]   Now Nineveh was a very large city.
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.740]   It took three days to go through it.
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.980]   Here's what is crazy about Nineveh, and just studying this.
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:57.620]   Nineveh was one of the wonders of the ancient world.
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.140]   Remember how I said they were vicious warlords?
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.060]   They're like, hey, we're gonna be known for being tough.
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.460]   Here's how they set up the city.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.500]   It was further, we're gonna be known for being tough.
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.420]   You hear me?
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.100]   And so they set up the city with these massive walls.
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.700]   I mean, walls, I've never,
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.140]   I like over and over went to go fact check
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.900]   because I was like, that can't be the case.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.700]   100 feet tall walls that were three chariots deep
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.140]   so they could ride three chariots worth on them.
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.060]   They literally wanted to show to the world around them,
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.180]   hey, don't mess with us.
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.220]   See our chariot races?
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.700]   We will dominate you in 100,
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.340]   that's taller than the ceiling.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.260]   I mean, this makes the wall,
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.940]   whatever between Mexico and Texas gets built,
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.580]   it makes that look like child's play, if it ever happens.
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.580]   It makes it look like, oh my gosh, that's pathetic.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.540]   And this was this incredible city.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.300]   It was 60 miles in circumference.
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.820]   I mean, it was a wonder to the ancient world.
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.620]   It was a city full of 600,000 people.
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.220]   It's three days just to journey across it.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:54.220]   And Jonah shows up and he sees this incredible, huge city.
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.380]   And here's what happens.
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.980]   Jonah began by going one day's journey into the city.
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.980]   And he began proclaiming,
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.900]   40 more days in Nineveh will be overthrown.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:11.340]   Verse five, the Ninevites believed God.
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.380]   We're gonna pick that up here in a second.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.780]   But the second criteria,
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.740]   second thing that we see from Jonah's life,
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.100]   the second type or quality of a person
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.460]   that God's gonna use is someone who shares his message.
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.040]   All that Jonah did was say, man, God gave this message,
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.180]   I'm just gonna go around and I'm gonna share it.
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.540]   The second quality of the person that God uses,
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.700]   if you wanna be someone who lives a life
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.540]   that God uses for incredible significance and impact,
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.860]   you are gonna be someone who shares the message of God.
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.220]   Our message is very different than Jonah had in that day.
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:43.340]   40 more days and Nineveh's gonna be overthrown or fall.
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.840]   Our message is the gospel of Jesus.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.500]   But what we can see from Jonah's example
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.440]   is that Jonah was willing to share God's message
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.020]   even when it was uncomfortable.
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.300]   He was willing to share the truth
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.940]   even when it was uncomfortable.
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.780]   As believers, if you and I are gonna be people
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.860]   who live significant lives,
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.180]   it's gonna involve some uncomfortable moments
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.820]   where we share the truth of who God is,
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.340]   that we are called, like Jonah,
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.180]   to confront people with the truth.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:14.440]   The good news is, ours is a lot easier of a pill to swallow.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.500]   If you're Jonah and you have to go into the ISIS beehive
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.780]   and essentially go, yeah, all of you guys
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.780]   are gonna be toast in 40 days, turn to God,
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.540]   it's not gonna be the most welcoming,
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.620]   oh, this guy's awesome, I gotta come hear him again,
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.680]   this is amazing.
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.100]   But he still confronted those people with truth
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.680]   even when it was uncomfortable.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.500]   The same is true for us.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.300]   There's just things in sharing the message of Jesus
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.500]   that, I mean, there's no way to like,
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.100]   oh, we're gonna sweeten the deal on this one
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.580]   and it's gonna really go down easy.
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.740]   Things like this.
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.320]   Everyone's going to die.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.920]   There's just not a way to get around that being a,
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.540]   oh man, tell me more, huh,
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.100]   this is such an encouraging message.
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.580]   There's certain things that are just a part
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.740]   of the reality of our world and a part of our message
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:06.500]   that no matter how you try to spin 'em
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.900]   and how gently we share them, which you should,
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.520]   are not gonna be received as, man,
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.760]   that is the most exciting, comfortable truth
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.600]   that I've ever heard.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.440]   Things like this.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.540]   Jesus is the only way to heaven.
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.220]   That's what the Bible teaches.
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.100]   That's what we think is true.
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.100]   And in order to be a Christian, you have to believe that.
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.620]   So if we're gonna be faithful to sharing truth,
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.100]   we're gonna have to experience and be faithful
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.240]   even when it's uncomfortable.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.080]   Things like this.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.080]   You're not a good enough person to enter heaven.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.420]   That's another truth that's not exactly a welcomed one
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.300]   in a culture, in a world like ours
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.380]   that increasingly says, man, everybody gets to believe
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.300]   whatever they wanna believe
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.020]   and you can't tell anyone that we're wrong.
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.920]   You cannot be someone who God uses
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.300]   without being willing to share his message,
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.120]   which involves sharing things
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.860]   that are not always the most comfortable thing.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.060]   You know what happens when we and I
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.700]   are willing to share the truth,
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.700]   even when it's not the most comfortable truth to share
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.320]   in a culture that says, no, the truth is all relative?
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.620]   It leads people to action.
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.820]   Like oftentimes, this is the thing that people going,
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.220]   oh man, I'm gonna die someday.
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.320]   The idea that all roads lead to God
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.900]   or all religions teach the same thing
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:18.940]   is actually not true
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.020]   because none of them actually teach that.
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.100]   It's those types of,
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.300]   when that grabs onto someone's mind or heart,
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.300]   God uses that to change and transform their life.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.460]   It's often the uncomfortable truths
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.540]   that lead people to act.
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.780]   I was studying this past week
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.180]   and do you know what the most effective way
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.920]   to get people to evacuate from a hurricane is?
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.260]   Scare them to death.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.060]   I mean, it's literally, what happens,
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.020]   whenever a hurricane come,
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.260]   like in Harvey, you know this,
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.900]   or in Irma comes,
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.580]   or when there was a hurricane that came on the East Coast
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.580]   and there are just times where it's the governor
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.700]   and the mayor and different people,
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.220]   they're like, we have to get these people out of here.
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.180]   If they stay, they're going to die.
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.500]   And so they have put incredible amounts of research
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.700]   into what is the most effective way
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:02.540]   to get people out of here
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.380]   'cause we gotta get them out of here.
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.220]   Like Katrina, they just investigate or research,
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.580]   like how do we get people to evacuate
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.040]   so that their life would be spared?
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.220]   And what they found is there are a few ways
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:17.220]   and there's the way of putting it on the radio
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.220]   or putting it on television
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.340]   or on like Facebook and social media.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.300]   It's the least effective way.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.740]   Least effective way to get people
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.780]   to actually move and evacuate out is to do that.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.060]   There's a little bit more effective way
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.020]   and that's going door to door.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.220]   So this happened in Harvey,
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.740]   or this, you may have had family in Irma,
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.900]   which was the Florida hurricane this past year,
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.380]   where they go around and they're like,
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.900]   hey ma'am, there's gonna be a hurricane on Thursday,
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.660]   just wanna let you know you need to evacuate.
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.540]   The roads are gonna be shut down Thursday afternoon
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.460]   so you need to be out by Thursday morning.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.460]   You gotta get out of here.
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.420]   That's a little bit more effective than the TV,
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.260]   but not as effective as the main way
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.740]   that people are effective,
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.980]   which is to make sure they know you are going to die
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.820]   if you stay here.
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:57.740]   Here's how they do that,
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.860]   and they take it seriously.
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:00.860]   It's like in Florida,
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.420]   they went around handing out Sharpies
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.420]   and said please write your social security number
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.980]   on your body so that when you float by us,
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.740]   I mean, I know, it's a little bit like,
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.580]   oh man.
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.820]   (laughing)
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.500]   We will know who to contact.
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.340]   So please in permanent marker,
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.340]   write your name and your social security number.
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.740]   Another hurricane,
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.180]   they went around and just said,
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.620]   hey, we're looking for next of kin
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.900]   because we're gonna need to know who to contact
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.740]   for when they wanna bury your body.
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.380]   So will you just tell us who to call for you?
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.500]   I mean, does it happen?
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.820]   In an East Coast storm,
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.740]   they went around and handed out tow tags.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:34.580]   What's a tow tag?
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.580]   It's what they put on people in a morgue
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.420]   whenever you're dead,
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.260]   and they said, will you fill this out
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.100]   and put it on your toe
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.220]   because we're gonna need to identify you
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.780]   whenever we're picking up the bodies.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.340]   It's the single most effective way
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.140]   to get people to take action
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.460]   is they confront them with the truth.
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.820]   That if you stay here,
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.300]   it's not gonna be okay.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:59.340]   Sometimes Christianity,
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.340]   as a follower of Jesus,
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.780]   involves us taking that step
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.820]   towards communicating to the world around us,
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.140]   hey, if you stay here,
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.700]   it's not gonna be okay.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.460]   If you continue to believe
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.460]   that you being a good person
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.540]   will get you into heaven,
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.460]   you're not gonna be okay.
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.900]   If you continue to believe,
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.380]   you can believe whatever you want out there
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.620]   'cause I just believe that my God accepts everybody.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.860]   Your God's not real.
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.020]   The God who's there does accept everyone
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.420]   who accepts his free gift of Jesus dying on the cross.
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.180]   That's what the real God is there.
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.780]   That's what the real God believes and shares.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.940]   And so sometimes we have to cross over
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.340]   and say, man, I'm gonna share the truth
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.940]   even when it's uncomfortable.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.220]   I'm not gonna be a jerk about it
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.060]   and picket and yell.
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.700]   I'm gonna do so as winsomely as I can,
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.100]   but it involves sharing the truth.
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.620]   I had a dinner not long ago with my wife
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.940]   and my mother and father-in-law,
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.220]   my wife's parents.
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.740]   And we were at dinner and the waitress came up
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.380]   and we were just talking and getting to know her
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.500]   and all of a sudden the conversation of faith came up
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.420]   and I just asked her, hey, do you have a faith?
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.540]   Her name was Ashley.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.500]   And she said something that's not uncommon here, no.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.300]   She said, yeah, I believe that God
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.500]   loves and accepts everyone.
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.020]   And I said, man, I believe that God loves
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.180]   and accepts everyone too.
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.220]   Can I tell you about it?
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:30.180]   I believe that God loves everyone so much
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.340]   that he made a way for everyone to be accepted
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:37.140]   by sending his own son to die on the cross for their sins
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.700]   and whoever trusts in what Jesus did on the cross
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.860]   paying for their sin, not in how good of a person they are,
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.180]   not in the things that they've done,
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.780]   not in the bad things that they've done
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.620]   that would keep them out of heaven,
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.300]   whoever says I trust in Jesus,
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.500]   Jesus paid for everything in my past,
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.280]   everything in my present, everything in my future,
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.820]   that person can have eternal life
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:00.320]   and is loved and God has already extended the offer
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.980]   to be accepted to them.
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.460]   And she responded, yeah, I don't think that that's true
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.980]   and I don't believe that.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.380]   And I said, man, that's awesome.
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.740]   Where do you find the basis for your belief
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.460]   that do whatever you want, believe whatever you want
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.100]   and as long as you're a good person, you're gonna be fine?
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.720]   I don't know, it's just kind of what I believe
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.060]   and it was one of those moments where generally,
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.540]   at least for me when I'm sharing my faith,
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.140]   it generally, there's not a lot of pushback
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.820]   where it's like, yeah, I don't believe that
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.300]   and can I get you something else, you want some water?
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.020]   Which is what that moment was and it involved going,
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.700]   hey, but let me tell you this, Ashley,
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:39.060]   the God who is there loves you so much
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:43.060]   that he sent me, not because there's anything special
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.100]   about me at all and I think he sends believers
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.340]   into our lives or he sends believers into your life
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.780]   to share the message of his love that he is there
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.940]   and he did die in your place and he died in my place
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.420]   and to anyone who will just accept his free gift,
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.200]   they will have eternal life forever.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.220]   And it wasn't a moment where it was easy
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.100]   or even like, she wasn't like, oh gosh,
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.540]   well, hey, can I pray the prayer right now?
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:07.500]   What do I need to do?
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.140]   It was a, yeah, I don't believe that
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:12.220]   and so that's fine with you but it was a moment
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.260]   where I'm not called to do anything
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.100]   other than be faithful to share the message.
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.660]   If you are a Christian and if maybe you finally
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.620]   got your friend to come with you for the first time
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.020]   and they're not exactly here tonight
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.700]   and they're not exactly on board
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.980]   with the entire Christian thing and you're like,
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.700]   oh man, this was the worst night ever
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.540]   to bring this person with me, it's not normally like this.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.900]   It's just a part of following Jesus
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.940]   is that we believe that man, we found the answer,
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.420]   the antidote to a virus or to a killer
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.860]   far worse than cancer, far worse than any sickness
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.060]   that is out there and it's the most unloving thing to do
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.820]   to when a storm is coming, when there is a hurricane
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.260]   coming in to not go around and say,
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.380]   hey, if you stay here, you're not gonna be okay.
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.100]   I can pretend that, no, you just pretend
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.940]   if it works for you, how insane would that be
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.300]   in that hurricane scenario to just be,
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.860]   to receive the answer from the person inside of that house.
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.100]   No, it's gonna be fine for me.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.020]   I believe that storms will go around my house
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.140]   and everything will be fine.
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.900]   You'd be like, you are a looney tune.
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.500]   You gotta get out of here, lady.
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:20.380]   It would be unloving to say or to not share
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.860]   a storm is coming and if you stay here,
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.300]   you're not gonna be okay and that's essentially
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:28.020]   what Christians are called by God.
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.820]   One of the ways that he uses them is by sharing the truth,
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.300]   even when it is uncomfortable and Jonah goes in
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.340]   and shares the truth with that city
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.380]   and something amazing happens.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.820]   In response to a message that,
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.460]   it's not the most impressive sermon of all time.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.500]   It's eight words, it's five in the Hebrew.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.860]   40 days and this place is going down
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.980]   and something amazing happens, verse five.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:58.980]   The Ninevites believed God.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.860]   The Ninevites believed, not Jonah.
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.860]   The Ninevites believed God.
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.580]   They expressed in a moment, faith.
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.940]   They trusted in God and a fast was proclaimed.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.780]   All of them from the greatest to the least
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.580]   put on sackcloth, a fast, essentially,
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.300]   all that they did was they went into mourning,
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.580]   saying, hey, we have been wrong.
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.500]   We have been living wrong and sackcloth
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.460]   was essentially like putting on funeral clothes together.
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.380]   Sackcloth is like potato sacks.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.260]   If you remember potato sack races as a kid.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.140]   Essentially, that's what they ended up putting on.
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.980]   Everybody's putting on potato sacks and not eating.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.580]   Call it fast because this is what we're hoping will happen.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.980]   When Jonah's warning reached the king,
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.780]   he rose from his throne and he took off his royal robes,
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:45.420]   covered himself with sackcloth and he sat down in the dust
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.460]   that even the king is involved.
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:51.860]   This is the proclamation that he issued in Nineveh.
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.980]   By decree of the king and his nobles,
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:56.940]   do not let people or animals or herds
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.540]   or flocks taste anything.
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:00.860]   Do not let them eat or drink.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.980]   So the king declares everyone's gonna fast,
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:08.580]   even the animals, but let the peoples and the animals
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.620]   be covered in sackcloth, which is like the dog sweater
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.820]   years and years before it ever happens.
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:14.980]   And it's kind of amazing.
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.060]   You gotta think, like, how did they get that on the cow
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.620]   and put it on?
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:25.140]   Let everyone call urgently on God,
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.060]   the one true God, not Dagon,
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.940]   the God that they believed in.
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.740]   Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:33.940]   Who knows?
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.900]   God may yet relent and with compassion
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.620]   turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.460]   But when God saw what they did,
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.260]   how they turned from their evil ways,
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:45.020]   how he relented, or how they turned from their evil ways,
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.180]   he relented and he did not bring on them
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.220]   the destruction that he had threatened.
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.460]   This, I think, is the greatest miracle
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.300]   in the entire book of Jonah.
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.500]   A lot of people think of the greatest miracle
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.380]   as the fish, clearly.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.820]   Like, when you ask the answer,
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.860]   Jonah, yeah, the story about the fish.
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.420]   Jonah just experienced, or saw firsthand,
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.420]   the greatest revival we have recorded in the Bible.
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.460]   The greatest revival maybe recorded in all of human history
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.340]   where an entire city is turned upside down
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.580]   by a five-word message from a guy
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.460]   who, in a city that took three days to go through,
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.580]   he goes one day into the city,
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.820]   preaches five words,
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.380]   and the entire city is turned upside down.
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.940]   How could this be possible?
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:26.780]   Because God was the one who was causing
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.820]   the hearts of the Ninevites to turn back to him.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.420]   That God was clearly doing something supernatural
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:34.060]   inside of the hearts of these people.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:38.620]   That God was keeping the prophecy, in essence,
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.260]   that in 40 days, or within 40 days,
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.620]   this city will be overthrown.
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:42.460]   Why do I say that?
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.220]   Because the word overthrown has two meanings.
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:47.100]   One, it'll be destroyed, or it'll be overturned.
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.780]   It can either mean to be overthrown,
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:50.620]   that was the prophecy,
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.180]   and in 40 days, this place is gonna be overthrown.
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.020]   Can be destroyed or overturned.
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:58.340]   And God doesn't allow invaders or things from the outside
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.980]   to come in and take down the city.
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.540]   He takes it from the inside
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.220]   and the hearts of all of the people,
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.520]   and he turns them to him.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.980]   Something clearly supernatural was going on here
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.900]   where God allows this unimpressive message.
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.240]   I mean, if I preached that sermon,
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.920]   no one would ever come back.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.080]   And not just 'cause it's a hard truth,
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.980]   but because it's like, this is five words.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.620]   I don't even know what to do with this.
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.380]   And God turns the city upside down.
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.240]   That is crazy.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.660]   Because God was clearly the one behind,
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.140]   and clearly the one at work here.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:33.420]   The greatest miracle is what God does amongst these people.
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.100]   And he changes and turns the city upside down.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:35.940]   And here's what I mean by that.
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.820]   If you're like, ah, yeah, it kind of is,
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:40.300]   but maybe they just really felt bad
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.940]   and they decided to turn to God.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.520]   Maybe he really wasn't the one behind it
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.780]   and orchestrating and causing the hearts of these people
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.860]   to turn to him.
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:50.900]   I mean, how would you explain that
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.100]   if it happened in our own country?
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.780]   I mean, seriously, apart from God,
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.340]   apart from God actually doing something
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:56.500]   in people's hearts, here's what I mean by that.
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.700]   If you leave here tonight,
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.820]   you go out inside of the city of Dallas,
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.620]   and you begin to proclaim this message,
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.180]   this five words, you just go out and you go,
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:06.020]   hey, 40 days from now, and Nineveh,
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.940]   or Dallas, will be overthrown.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.740]   Thank you very much, let me close in prayer.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:12.940]   And all of a sudden, the entire city is turned upside down.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.100]   I mean, everyone's like, hey, shut down the Mavericks games,
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.620]   we gotta go all into prayer and fasting.
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.220]   President Trump comes out and says,
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.300]   excuse me, American people,
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.100]   we are all gonna go into prayer and fasting,
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.780]   and I want all the pets in burlap right now.
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:28.020]   You would be like, clearly, this is a God thing.
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.220]   If there's ever a God thing,
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:30.860]   this was clearly just a God thing.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.820]   It wasn't the messenger that made it happen,
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.420]   it was the God of the messenger.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:37.540]   And this is the way that God works.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.060]   The third idea from this text is that God uses people
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.620]   in spite of people.
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:47.100]   That ultimately, when God decides to bring about
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.220]   an incredible revival inside of a city,
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.500]   it is all about the God, not the messenger.
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.980]   That God uses people in spite of people.
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:59.360]   God's role, God alone, is the one who saves.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.820]   We share the message, and it's ultimately up to God
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.140]   whether or not someone will respond
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.900]   or whether or not someone is going to come to trust
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.980]   or come to believe like the Ninevites did.
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:14.260]   The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 12, three,
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.220]   about the idea that God alone saves.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:17.780]   And this is an uncomfortable truth,
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.100]   and I'll share why in a second,
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:19.940]   but here's what it says.
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:24.260]   That no man can say Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.260]   Unless the Holy Spirit allows a person,
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.540]   they cannot believe and express that.
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.160]   John 1, verses 13.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:34.180]   To as many as received him, Jesus,
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.900]   he gave the right to become children of God
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.900]   who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of man,
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.340]   nor of the will of flesh, but born of God,
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:44.660]   that God caused it to happen.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.860]   John 6, verses 37 and 44.
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.300]   Jesus speaking, he says, "No one can come to me
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:53.180]   "unless the Father who sent them draws them to me.
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:57.860]   "And all that the Father gives to me will come to me."
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:01.500]   In other words, that God says it is God alone
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.260]   who draws, who drew the Ninevites to him.
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.680]   If you're a believer, who drew you to him.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.620]   And maybe you're going in the room like,
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.100]   "Man, that doesn't paint a really good picture.
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.820]   "Like, if God can do it, if God's alone, that saves him,
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.100]   "why didn't he just save everybody?"
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.140]   He's trying to by sending people like you and like me
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.460]   into your workplace, into your apartment complex,
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.740]   into the places that you live,
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.580]   into the organizations that you're a part of,
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:22.820]   and the families that you're in.
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.580]   He's like, "I got my girl on the job.
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.440]   "She's at AT&T, I got her on the eighth floor.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.920]   "I got her there, she's the light of the world.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.960]   "She's gonna share the gospel."
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.500]   God is pursuing people,
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.800]   and often he's pursuing them through you.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:39.780]   And our role is just to share, God's role is to save.
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:43.060]   Well, then why didn't God just do it on his own
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:43.900]   and save him without us?
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.780]   Because he wants us to experience being used by him
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.140]   for significant ways.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:53.220]   He doesn't need us, he doesn't need you, he doesn't need me.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.460]   But he wants us to experience being used by him
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.740]   in significant ways, i.e. the message
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:59.780]   that we're talking about.
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:02.400]   How do you be a person that God uses?
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.060]   He wants us to be someone that he uses,
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.480]   and he wants us to open our mouths and share
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.940]   and trust him that he alone is the one who saves.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.780]   It's like this, when I was in college,
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:15.140]   I volunteered at this boys and girls club
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.480]   in Bryan College Station.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:20.180]   And it was a college station,
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:23.420]   but we would participate in these fourth and fifth grade,
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.260]   it was inner city basketball and football.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:30.940]   And I would coach this fourth grade team,
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.500]   and we would get dominated.
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.500]   I mean, just straight up just destroyed
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.660]   at basketball and football, except for one year.
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.260]   And I don't wanna brag, but there was one year
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.820]   that we were the city-wide champs,
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.180]   fourth grade Purple Panthers, it's a true story.
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:47.100]   And I was the coach of this flag football little league.
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.300]   I tried to find a picture, like desperately,
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.660]   it's out there, people, okay, it's my one claim to fame.
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:55.140]   And what happened on the team was,
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.260]   we got this, we had all the kids come together
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.580]   the first day, and all of a sudden,
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.060]   I see this kid named Ray, who's on our team,
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:04.180]   who would end up being the MVP by far,
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.900]   not just of the league, of the team,
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.580]   of like, man, you should just coach right now,
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.460]   take the whistle.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.460]   And he was this kid, he wasn't bigger than anybody else,
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.940]   but he just like, knew the game.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.940]   His dad had like, played college football,
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.180]   and his dad was really into it,
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.020]   and he just, he knew how to play.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.020]   So whenever we would line up,
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.540]   he's with a bunch of eight and nine-year-olds,
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.860]   he would be out there, and he played quarterback,
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.500]   and he'd be like, all right, Kiki, you go over here,
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:25.780]   Bucci, you're going right there, all right,
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.740]   hey, you're gonna take the ball,
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.500]   it's gonna be a sweep right, here's what you're gonna do.
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.140]   And he would literally lay out the entire thing,
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.660]   and he would tell everyone what to do.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.980]   And any time that we wanted to score, here's what we did.
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.140]   'Cause he just like, he had hand-eye coordination
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.540]   and things that the other kids are like, is that a flower?
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:43.540]   And he was like, okay, and I mean, it's like breaking ankles
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.180]   and the other kids are like,
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.100]   do we get orange slices yet or not?
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.880]   And he was just like, I have a tiger, man,
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.620]   headband and everything.
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.140]   And any time that we wanted to score,
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:54.980]   we'd do the same thing.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.220]   I mean, I would just say, hey, quarterback sneak,
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.060]   or quarterback draw, and he would just take it,
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.500]   and he would take it to the house,
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.740]   and it happened every single time.
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:06.120]   And to the point where we would go three downs,
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.060]   and we would want the other kids to play,
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:11.020]   so I would be like, Ray, you gotta let the other kids
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.220]   have the ball, so let Kiki run one time,
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.500]   so I want you to hand it off to Kiki.
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.020]   So we would hand it off to Kiki,
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.020]   and then the next play, he'd be like,
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.380]   all right, Bucci, here's what we're gonna do.
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.940]   We're gonna do the, and he's calling these crazy plays,
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:23.500]   and he would hand it off and let him take the ball
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.340]   and let him run.
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.140]   He'd get, of course, his flag dropped like five yards back.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.780]   And then on the fourth down, we'd just like,
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.180]   Ray, take it to the house.
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.660]   And this happened, and true story, we won every game.
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.340]   We smoked everybody, it was amazing.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.020]   And why is this story taking so long?
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:40.300]   And, (laughs) I'm just reliving the glory days.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.980]   And, (audience laughs)
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:47.980]   and we would involve the other people on the team,
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.060]   'cause we needed to?
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:53.280]   No, because we wanted them to be a part of it.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.340]   We didn't need Bucci to get sacked five yards back.
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.580]   (audience laughs)
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:01.140]   And true story, his name was Bucci.
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:05.300]   And, (laughs) that's a great name, that's your name.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.020]   And, (audience laughs)
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.900]   it was because of one reason, we wanted them to be involved.
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.700]   We wanted them to be a part of it.
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.820]   Not because we're afraid of losing or afraid of not,
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.860]   no, we wanted them to be a part of it.
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:19.340]   This is what God is doing with the message of Christianity.
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:20.800]   It's not because he's afraid of, oh man,
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.060]   people are not gonna get saved
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.060]   if I don't step in and work there.
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:24.980]   He wants you and I to be a part of it.
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.920]   God alone saves, but he's invited us,
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.820]   not because he needs us,
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:32.180]   but because he wants us to be a part of it.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:33.940]   If you are a Christian in the room,
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.500]   if you wanna be someone that God uses,
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.660]   it's gonna involve you knowing that whatever your story is,
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.300]   even if you're not a Christian in the room,
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.900]   you need to know that whatever your story is,
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.700]   you are not too far gone for God to use you
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:49.020]   in incredible, amazing, significant ways,
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:49.980]   just like he did with Jonah.
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.860]   An undeserving person who goes one day into the city,
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.380]   not three days, bare minimum.
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.180]   He's the guy that's like, what's it take to pass?
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.940]   I'm gonna do that and get out of here.
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.660]   And God uses him to bring about the greatest revival
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.260]   in the history of the world.
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.020]   Where everything's turned upside down.
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.340]   Because Jonah was a good guy?
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:11.500]   No, because despite all of his flaws, God would use him.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:15.700]   Our role is to share, God's role is to save.
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.700]   What you need to know,
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.420]   if you've never had a moment here tonight,
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.300]   and I know you're here,
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.060]   what you've trusted in what Jesus did on the cross,
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.260]   time for you.
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:27.180]   God has been orchestrating and working behind the scenes
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.740]   in your life to try to get your attention,
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:30.580]   to try to bring you to a place
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.620]   where you would trust in that.
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.460]   That's why you're here tonight.
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.860]   That's why you're in a church on a Tuesday night.
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.100]   Because the God who is there is trying to get your attention
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:41.420]   when are you gonna stop trusting in who you are?
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:45.580]   Or stop making up excuses like you're too bad of a person
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.100]   to be used by God or to be accepted by God
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.980]   because of what he did in Jesus.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.340]   And when are you gonna turn and accept
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:55.540]   what he did on your behalf and give your life to him?
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:00.340]   In summary, the person that God uses is always used
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.060]   despite their story,
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:05.100]   is a person who shares the message of God,
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.060]   even when it is uncomfortable.
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:10.220]   And ultimately, God uses people in spite of people.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:11.820]   He is at work in spite of us.
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.340]   I'll close here.
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:20.660]   I was studying this past week and came across a story of,
[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:23.380]   you guys know who Alfred Nobel is?
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.340]   You may not recognize that name,
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:31.220]   but you may recognize something that he came up with,
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:33.060]   which is the Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:38.220]   The Nobel Peace Prize is essentially a part of a legacy
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:40.220]   that he started 115 years ago,
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:42.060]   but Alfred Nobel was not known
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:43.940]   for being the Nobel Peace Prize guy.
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.060]   Here's what happened.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:48.700]   He was born in the late 1800s, in the 1800s,
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.500]   and he invented something called dynamite,
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.940]   or Shane Everett told me to say it's TNT,
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.820]   which I think is just on the Looney Tunes, for real.
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:56.860]   And he invented dynamite.
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.740]   And dynamite was this new invention on the scene.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.020]   He comes up with dynamite, and he becomes a millionaire.
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:02.420]   $300 million.
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:06.900]   Very quickly, incredible riches.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:07.900]   Alfred Nobel.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:11.580]   And one day, and he hadn't invented any Peace Prize
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.900]   or anything like that, he invented dynamite.
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:17.340]   And one day he wakes up and he goes to pick up the newspaper
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:21.460]   and he reads on the newspaper, front of the paper,
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:23.540]   "The merchant of death is dead.
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:27.260]   "Alfred Nobel, the man who got rich,
[00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.140]   "discovering ways to kill people faster
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.140]   "than anyone else, is dead."
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:36.540]   And it wasn't a joke, and he was clearly very much alive.
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:40.460]   And what had happened was the newspaper had heard
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.700]   that a Nobel had died.
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.220]   They thought it was him, it was Ludwig, his brother.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:46.140]   His brother had died, but the newspaper got it wrong
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.180]   and they printed, man, Alfred Nobel died.
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:51.060]   And what he saw, what he was confronted with,
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:52.860]   was what the future was telling for him.
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.140]   Based on the life that he had lived,
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.180]   based on the things that he had done,
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.860]   the merchant of death, this is the legacy
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.540]   that I'm gonna live?
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:00.580]   This is who I am, this is how people perceive me,
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:01.940]   this is what I've been giving my life to,
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.860]   I'm the merchant of death, and it changed everything for him.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.100]   He spent the rest of his life, he said,
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.660]   "I'm taking all $300 million and I'm giving it
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.180]   "not to being the person who brought death and destruction
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.580]   "into the world, but to being the person
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.500]   "who would bring increasing amounts of peace."
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.460]   So that's why he started the Nobel Peace Prize Foundation.
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:22.700]   I want to be someone who isn't known for bringing death,
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.260]   but someone who's known for bringing peace.
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.860]   And every year, the person who brings an achievement
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.020]   or who ushers in some sort of action
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:32.500]   that leads to incredible amounts of peace
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:33.700]   is awarded that prize.
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.700]   But in other words, he was able to see
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:39.460]   my life is not gonna last forever.
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.140]   I'm gonna be known for the person
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.820]   who gives my life towards something.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.340]   We're all, at the end of our days, gonna be known
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.060]   as someone who gave our life
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:50.660]   towards something or to someone.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.700]   And he made the decision after he saw
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.060]   what none of us will ever get to see in the same way.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.540]   You probably are not gonna read an obituary
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.340]   of a front page paper that says your name,
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:00.620]   that says, "Man, this is how you died
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.740]   "and this is how you're gonna be known."
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:06.180]   But the God who is there is sending a message
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:09.860]   to every single person, every day that they're alive,
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:13.460]   all around you, he's trying to get your attention
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.100]   and my attention through his word
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.180]   that your life is a vapor.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.740]   It is gonna be here and it is gone.
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:20.660]   Think about a vapor.
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:22.580]   That's how the scripture expresses it.
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:26.620]   Today, there was a close friend of someone on our staff
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:27.900]   that went into the ground.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:28.860]   They were buried today.
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.340]   Last week, they were alive and it was fine
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:31.900]   and they were healthy and everything was okay.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:32.860]   And all of a sudden, it's gone.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.260]   That the life that you live and I live is a vapor.
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:36.300]   And at the end of it,
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.940]   what are you gonna have given your days to?
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:42.620]   When your time comes and when my time comes?
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:43.780]   And I know what's happening in the room,
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:47.180]   like you're young, like, "Dude, I'm gonna live forever."
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.900]   And I hope that this message, man,
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.500]   is stamped in your memory
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:53.540]   that just like Alfred Nobel,
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.100]   what are you gonna give your life to?
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.620]   And he saw the end and he made a change.
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.380]   I don't know where he was, with faith or believer.
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:45:59.820]   I don't even know that he made a good decision
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.260]   with 300 million 'cause if I'm him,
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.780]   giving it towards the mission and movement of Jesus,
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:06.860]   and I'm sure he wouldn't have believed it,
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.300]   would be a far better impact.
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.540]   But what are you gonna give your life to?
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.260]   To the only thing that at the end of our lives
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.940]   actually matters, which is Jesus
[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:16.500]   and making him known to living a life of purpose.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.700]   Are you gonna continue to buy the Dallas dream
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.660]   and the Dallas lie to get yourself a house
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:22.060]   and get yourself a white picket fence
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.980]   and a wife or a husband and a couple kids
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:24.860]   and a golden retriever,
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:26.140]   and that's gonna be the life that you live?
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.780]   And maybe you can retire at 65.
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.700]   Is it really the big, that's too small.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.700]   The American dream is too small of a dream
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.020]   to give your life to.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:37.260]   And you're gonna walk out these doors just like I am
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.420]   and you're gonna see advertisements and social media
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:40.940]   and people fighting for your attention saying,
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:42.420]   "Give your life to this."
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:45.620]   And when it all comes into perspective,
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:47.100]   what are you gonna give your life to?
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:48.260]   He had to make the decision.
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:49.620]   "What am I gonna give my life to?
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:50.820]   "I've already given so much of it
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:52.060]   "to dynamite and destruction.
[00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:52.900]   "Man, I'm gonna make the change
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.580]   "to give something for bringing peace."
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:56.540]   What are you gonna give your life to?
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:58.100]   What are you gonna give your 20s to?
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.380]   What are you gonna give tomorrow to?
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:02.540]   What are you right now giving your life to?
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:06.020]   If you've never had a moment in this room
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:07.780]   where you've trusted in Jesus,
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.940]   tonight is your night, man.
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:10.860]   And God who's there is saying,
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.460]   "I invite you to give your life to me.
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.100]   "I already gave my life for you."
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.940]   If you just accept it,
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:18.700]   for the rest of us who have,
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.300]   the invitation every single day,
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:23.060]   because we live in a world with incredible freedom,
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:24.740]   but it's pulling for our attention saying,
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.140]   "Give your life to this.
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:29.340]   "Give your life to the climbing of the corporate ladder.
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.220]   "Give your life to your 401k."
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.540]   Are you kidding me?
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:35.780]   Spend your entire life,
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:37.580]   that's unpromised by the way,
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:40.700]   so that you can have a certain amount
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:42.460]   in your bank account at the end of your days?
[00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:44.140]   That's a pathetic dream.
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:46.620]   If that's the only dream that's there,
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.060]   what are you gonna give your life to?
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.420]   What are you giving it to right now?
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.860]   Because that will pretty much tell you the answer.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:56.220]   Let me pray.
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.800]   (gentle music)
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:25.380]   Heavenly Father,
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.180]   would you do something amazing
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:32.420]   through the lives and the people that are in this room?
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:35.660]   Would you, Lord, raise up the next Billy Graham,
[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:36.820]   the next St. Patrick,
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:40.460]   the next sparker of a revival in our times,
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:44.060]   and would you turn our world upside down through them?
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:47.900]   Would you raise up godly women and men as missionaries,
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.180]   who spend the rest of their days
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.220]   giving their lives to your purpose and to your mission?
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:53.820]   Would you do something incredible, Lord?
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.900]   We pray and ask that you would raise up the body of Christ,
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:00.140]   and it would be stronger than ever into this chapter,
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:02.260]   and that someday, when they write the history books
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:03.660]   of the church in North America,
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:05.100]   they would speak of a man or a woman
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.660]   that is right now inside of this room,
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:10.340]   and of how they led a movement of the people of God
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:11.620]   who repented from their sins,
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:13.900]   who turned to you, who trusted in you,
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:15.260]   who shared the message of Jesus,
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.580]   the only message of eternal life,
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.220]   the message to the world around us,
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.740]   that if you stay where you are in your sins,
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:22.180]   it's not gonna be okay.
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.940]   (gentle music)
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:26.780]   Would you do something amazing, Lord?
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:30.020]   I don't have enough eloquent words,
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.760]   I don't have enough passion in my heart
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.400]   to be able to ask you to do that, Lord,
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.460]   but I know you wanna do that more than I do,
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.940]   or than anyone else here does,
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.300]   so Lord, we ask that you would do so.
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.140]   You say that the eyes of the Lord
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.820]   go to and fro throughout the entire earth
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:44.740]   looking for someone whose heart is fully his, Lord.
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:48.460]   Would you grab our hearts, and would they be fully yours?
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:51.820]   Would we build our life upon you and your promises?
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:56.820]   And would the ministry of Jonah
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:01.540]   pale in comparison to the ministry you unleashed
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:02.580]   through my friends here?
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:06.180]   I pray that you would, right now,
[00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:07.620]   on anyone who is not sure
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:09.180]   that they've trusted in Jesus Christ,
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:10.980]   they are not sure that if they died tonight,
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:13.180]   they would go spend eternity in heaven with God,
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.940]   that you, Lord, would press on their hearts,
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.020]   that they wouldn't leave this room,
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:17.940]   they wouldn't talk it away,
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:18.980]   they wouldn't get distracted,
[00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:20.020]   they wouldn't explain it away,
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:21.980]   that they would come to the end of themselves
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:23.420]   and realize, I'm not sure,
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.660]   and they would approach another believer,
[00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:27.380]   or they'd come down front,
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:29.340]   and that you would capture their heart,
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:31.700]   and you would do what only you can do, Lord,
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.380]   which is not what a message or music
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:34.300]   or anything else can do,
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.420]   but you are the God who saves.
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.060]   We worship you now, amen.
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.640]   (gentle music)
