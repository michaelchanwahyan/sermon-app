[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.500]   - All right, let's go.
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.420]   Self-care continues.
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.180]   Welcome, friends in the room.
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.400]   And yes, happy Valentine's Day week.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.060]   Singles Awareness Day is coming up.
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.980]   And we are continuing this series, Self-Care.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.220]   Anyone been to New York City recently?
[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.720]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.140]   Man, concrete jungle where dreams are made of.
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.720]   New York during the winter is like one of the best times
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.560]   to go to that city.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.740]   And it's such a fun city.
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.600]   We went not long ago, my wife and I.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.620]   And we did, of course, what you do when you go to New York
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.120]   and you're doing all the touristy things.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.080]   And so we stayed in the Lower East Side.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.720]   We went and saw a show, went to Times Square.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.440]   We went and saw the Christmas tree
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.600]   and just had a blast going around
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.860]   getting to experience all that was New York.
[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.080]   But one of my favorite parts of our trip,
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.800]   I didn't expect to be one of my favorite parts,
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.680]   and that was the subway station.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.600]   Any subway travelers?
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.160]   Like, dude, here's a couple things.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.480]   Yeah, thank you, good.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.320]   You're in Dallas.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.720]   Here's what I love about the subway station experience
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.780]   is one, it's like unbelievably cheap.
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.040]   It's like for a nickel, you can go all around the city
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.080]   as many times as you want.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.440]   And it's like $2.20 compared to an Uber.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.720]   It's unbelievable.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.080]   And there's something just that feels like,
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.660]   hey, I'm a real New Yorker.
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.720]   I'm like kinda in this little box right now
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.780]   with everyone that is like,
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.680]   it's essentially who I see at the DMV,
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.900]   all in one, we're getting a reunion together.
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.480]   We're hanging out in there and here we are,
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.160]   we're riding around, holding onto the thing
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.480]   and just had like a blast
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.200]   'cause it almost feels like you're going on the scavenger hunt
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.840]   every time of like, hey, where do we go now?
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.800]   Do we take the F train?
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.640]   Do we take the A train?
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.560]   What do we do?
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.960]   And throughout that experience,
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.440]   there were different times where because
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.680]   I wasn't that familiar with the train
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.960]   and I would think I'm getting onto one train
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.120]   and I would make the mistake
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.540]   and I thought we were going to Soho
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.620]   or we're going to Chelsea or we're going to Brooklyn
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.840]   and we ended up heading toward Queens
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.760]   and you don't realize it till you get close to it.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.880]   You're like, I don't think this is where
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.200]   we're supposed to be right now.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.380]   And what do you do in that situation?
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.540]   You're like, well, I gotta get off.
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.600]   I gotta figure out which train I need to be on
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.720]   and make sure that I get on the right train.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.240]   Now, what does that have to do with self-care?
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.720]   Well, in a very similar way is the idea of,
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.320]   hey, if you get on the wrong train,
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.020]   it's going to take you to the wrong destination.
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.960]   So it is with our thoughts.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.880]   Like the thoughts that you have are not just,
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.440]   hey, one and done, I had this thought and then it's done.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.480]   If you allow that thought to stay in your mind
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.280]   and you continue, it will invite other thoughts like it
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.520]   and it will lead you towards a destination.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.640]   We even have a term for this.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.780]   What's it called?
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.560]   Train of thought.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.880]   They're like, hey, our thoughts
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.060]   are not just an individual one-off,
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.280]   they're a train of thoughts that can be a part of them.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.520]   And unlike anything else in your life,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.320]   what you think about and your mind
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.600]   is gonna impact the person that you become.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.920]   And so if you don't have the ability
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.580]   to really control the trains of thoughts
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.960]   that are trying to get you and the ability to,
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.040]   hey, I need to get off this train of thought right now
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.120]   'cause it's making me freak out
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.140]   and I need to get on that train over there,
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.640]   you will live a life that you are no longer in control.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.720]   And so we're gonna talk about tonight
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.760]   what it looks like to control the mind.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.840]   But before I do, you know what I mean by like,
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.420]   the mind can be so powerful and it can just lead you
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.080]   and all of a sudden one thought leads to another
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.720]   that leads to another and you've jumped on this train
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.240]   and it is heading towards the destination
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.060]   that you don't wanna be at.
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.900]   What do I mean by that?
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.920]   Like here's some examples that I wrote out.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.360]   I called this the step on the WebMD train
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.400]   where all of a sudden you have like a sore back
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.420]   and you're like, man, what could this be?
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.080]   And I go into WebMD, I pull up the app,
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.700]   I like put in the symptoms and everything that comes up
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.920]   is like it could be an appendicitis rupture,
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.360]   kidney failure or cancer is in all of them.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.640]   And you're like, oh man, that is not good.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.320]   And all of a sudden you're like scheduling
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.560]   doctor's appointments to go see,
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.840]   because hey, I need to go see a doctor
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.040]   'cause I think my kidneys are failing right now.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.260]   I have cancer, back cancer.
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.000]   I didn't even know that happened, but that's what I have.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.040]   Or here's another train, the reading into things
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.640]   in a dating relationship train.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.380]   Where you're dating someone and you know,
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.640]   you're having gone on a few dates, things are going good.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.160]   Maybe you're the girl there, he's dropping you off
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.260]   and you're a few dates in and he drops you off
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.560]   and he's like, hey, I had a nice time.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.600]   And then he gives you a side hug and you're like,
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.200]   what does nice time mean?
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.600]   And side hug, really?
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.420]   You give me a side hug?
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.480]   And so you begin to play the train.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.980]   You're sitting there like, I don't even know
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.840]   if this guy likes me.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.000]   He didn't think I'm attractive.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.880]   I bet he likes Sarah is what's going on.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.120]   He's probably gonna break this up.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.380]   You know, I'm gonna break it off with him
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.440]   before he breaks it off with me,
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.280]   'cause that's what I'm gonna do.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.240]   And you just go crazy 'cause you follow the train of thought
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.080]   or, oh man, it's so true.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.400]   It all made a little crazy.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.200]   Or maybe it's like with your boss.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.480]   I don't know if you've been here,
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.280]   but you send an email to your boss
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.920]   and you don't get a response.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.040]   And you're like, huh, no response.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.800]   I wonder if he got the email.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.240]   Of course he got the email.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.440]   You can not get the email.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.440]   We work at the same company.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.880]   It's not like it went to spam.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.000]   He must have not liked my idea.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I bet he probably doesn't like me.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.920]   I bet I'm next on the chopping block for a job.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.640]   I need to update my LinkedIn profile.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.960]   I don't even know my LinkedIn password.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.800]   Man, I gotta find a new career.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.720]   And all of a sudden, just from one thought,
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.040]   and it's probably irrational.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.840]   Usually it's irrational and it has nothing to do
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.120]   with the boss was like, oh, it was off yesterday.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.400]   And you just lose your mind
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.240]   'cause you follow the train of thought.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.640]   And that can happen in little ways
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.720]   and it can happen in big ways.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.800]   But regardless, if you and I cannot learn
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.320]   the ability to get off of that thought train,
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.480]   then you and I are gonna not only not have control
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.720]   of our thoughts, you won't have control
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.560]   over the life that you're gonna live
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.880]   because nothing within your control
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.160]   and your thoughts are in your control.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.200]   And we're gonna talk about for the next really 30 minutes
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.440]   about how you can step off of that thought train.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.680]   But nothing that is in your control,
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.920]   like your thoughts will impact your life
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.840]   or your thoughts more than anything else
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.920]   that is within your control.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.800]   You can't control all the circumstances you face,
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.280]   everything that you're gonna face in life,
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.720]   but you can control your thoughts and how you react to them.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.800]   And here is why this is so important
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.760]   because it's pretty easy.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.480]   Whenever you're on the A train in Brooklyn
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.200]   and you need to get off and get on the other train,
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.040]   I know how to do it.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.200]   I just wait until the doors open.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.760]   I step off, I look at the chart and I'm like,
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.120]   all right, I need to go here.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.440]   It's not as easy or intuitive
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.680]   to get off some of the thought trains that we can get on.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.640]   So tonight, as we continue self-care,
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.200]   we are gonna talk about winning the battle of the mind.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.040]   This series has been a look at what does it look like
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.400]   to care for yourself biblically
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.520]   in terms of mind, body, spirit.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.160]   And so we're gonna cover body in a couple of weeks.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.320]   We're covering all these different issues
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.720]   about what does it look like to care for yourself.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.440]   And tonight we're gonna talk about what it looks like
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.200]   in regards to the mind,
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.520]   specifically how you can win the battle of the mind.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.760]   So we're gonna look at three principles.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.600]   If you take notes,
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.240]   we're looking at three things
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.320]   that if you wanna win the battle for your mind
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.560]   have got to be a part of the way that you think.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.560]   So three truths about filling your mind
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.400]   with the right things
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.760]   or really just winning the battle of your mind.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.120]   The first truth comes from 2 Corinthians 10.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.280]   We're in it.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.760]   Corinthians, if you have your Bible, you flip open.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.800]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, Corinthians.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.080]   If not, it'll be on the screen.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.040]   Corinthians was written by the Apostle Paul,
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.680]   formerly known as Saul.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.640]   And he wrote this book to the Corinthian church.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.920]   And in it, he lays out as it relates to thinking
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.960]   some of the things that they're to do.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.960]   Here's what he says.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.640]   "For though we live in this world,
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.160]   "we do not wage war as the world does.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.120]   "The weapons that we fight with
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.400]   "are not the weapons of the world.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.360]   "On the contrary, they have divine power
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.080]   "to demolish strongholds."
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.680]   That same word strongholds is translated prisons.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.120]   "That the things that we fight with,"
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.560]   and he's gonna allude,
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.320]   he's really talking about truth,
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.560]   "have the power to unlock people from prison."
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.560]   From the prisons that their decisions have made,
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.040]   the prisons that they can find themselves
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.440]   in their own minds creating,
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.080]   that's the power that we have in Christ through truth.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.800]   "We demolish arguments and every pretension
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.480]   "that sets itself up against the knowledge of God.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.360]   "And we take captive or we capture and arrest."
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.900]   It's the same word in Greek translated.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.120]   "Every thought and we make it obedient to Christ."
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.600]   So Paul says that as followers of Jesus,
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.420]   as it relates to the thoughts that we have,
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.680]   you are to take every thought captive
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.200]   and you're to arrest it and make sure
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.820]   that it is in line with what God says,
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:25.760]   with what is true,
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.600]   and you use the truth to combat the lies the enemy feeds you
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.640]   and the way that you fight the battle of the mind
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.680]   involves taking captive the thoughts that you have
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.360]   and aligning them with truth
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.780]   and getting rid of any of the toxic thoughts that you have.
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.040]   The first idea I wanna talk about from this text
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:40.960]   and really the Bible in general
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.040]   is that if you wanna experience freedom
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.400]   and really win the battle of your mind,
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.240]   you have got to remove toxic thinking.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.240]   Remove toxic thinking.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.760]   All of us came in the room tonight,
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.360]   all of us have had thoughts fill our minds that are toxic.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.000]   They are not in line with God's word
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.600]   and you have to capture or arrest those thoughts.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.480]   And thoughts like that are gonna pop up,
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.020]   they're negative thoughts, they're anxious thoughts,
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.080]   they're lustful thoughts, all kinds of different thoughts.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.120]   And they're thoughts that God would say,
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.420]   "Hey, those things are gonna pop in your head,
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.400]   "but it is your choice over whether you will dwell on them."
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.500]   And as a believer in Christ, you grab those thoughts,
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.600]   you say, "I'm choosing not to dwell on you.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.960]   "I'm choosing not to dwell on you."
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.600]   Then we remove toxic thoughts.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.160]   Basically, we audit our mind and evaluate
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.920]   as we think about what we're thinking about.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.760]   Hey, what is this thought?
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.600]   Is this from God?
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.120]   Is this what he would want me to be thinking right now?
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.120]   And anything that's not,
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.280]   I'm gonna remove that from my mind.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.980]   I'm gonna talk about what some of those things are.
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.860]   But it's not dissimilar to this.
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.880]   Whenever you go to the airport a few weeks ago,
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.400]   you have to go through what?
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.240]   Security.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.120]   You gotta go through TSA,
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.040]   you gotta go, you gotta take off all your shoes
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.720]   and go through and make sure you don't have a belt on
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.000]   and make sure there's nothing hazardous or dangerous
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.140]   or sharp or explosive inside of the bags that you have.
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.020]   I was with a friend, he was coming with me
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.000]   for a speaking opportunity in Missouri
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.360]   and he just kinda tagged along and his bag got flagged.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.540]   And they pulled his bag aside.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.240]   And usually you're thinking like,
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.760]   man, did I bring a shampoo bottle that's too big?
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.380]   Like, come on guys, this is taking too long,
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.220]   can we just get out of here?
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.060]   And the guy pulls him aside, he says,
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.460]   "Hey, there's a knife in your bag."
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.280]   And he's like, "A knife?
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.360]   "I don't even know what you're talking about."
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.920]   And he says, "Well, do you know if it's a double-edged knife
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.920]   "or a two-sided knife?"
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.720]   And he's like, "Honestly, I'm not sure."
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.660]   And he said, "Well, if it is, there's a significant fine
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.160]   "and you will not be able to go forward."
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.000]   And I'm like, dude, let's hope that it isn't.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.520]   Good luck, buddy, 'cause every man for himself after this.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.160]   And the guy pulls it out and he begins to look at it
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.280]   and thank goodness it was just a pocket knife.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.120]   But it was one of those things where TSA,
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.460]   Security in General, says, "Hey, there are certain items
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.900]   "that we are not allowing to come in here,
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.160]   "whether they're hazardous, toxic, or dangerous,
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.900]   "like knives or guns and things like that."
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.320]   The Apostle Paul says, "When it comes to your mind,
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.620]   "you have got to be the security checkpoint.
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.540]   "You will not allow knives or negative thoughts
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.060]   "or things that are not from God,
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.180]   "things that are not biblical,
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.660]   "things that are not true to come into your mind."
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.020]   As soon as you identify those things,
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.180]   you're saying, "I'm not going to dwell on this thing."
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.180]   And here's why this matters for you.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.740]   Because so many of the knives that you allow
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.700]   and I allow into our minds,
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:15.240]   they're a little bit like those hidden pocket knives
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.520]   you didn't even realize were there.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.400]   In other words, just like when you go through security,
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.940]   rarely is someone caught and like,
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.780]   "Oh man, I didn't even realize I brought a bomb, who knew?"
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.620]   Generally, they're like,
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.280]   "Oh man, I forgot about the pocket knife."
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.120]   Yeah, you can keep it.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.560]   In the same way, there are toxic thoughts
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.320]   that you think every day, they seem harmless.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.780]   You may not even realize you're doing it
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.380]   'cause it's just so natural.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.940]   And they are things that Paul would say, "That's a knife."
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.100]   You need to confiscate it and remove it from your thinking.
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.020]   You cannot choose all the different thoughts
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.540]   that are gonna pop up from time to time,
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.300]   but you can choose what you are going to dwell on.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.820]   So let me give you some of the toxic ones
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.580]   that I think I've experienced,
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.700]   a really common experience for all of us.
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.820]   Anyone ever found themselves
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.400]   like not believing the best about someone?
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.940]   Toxic thought.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.300]   When I'm going, "Oh my gosh, yeah,
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.340]   "I can't believe that they did that.
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.180]   "They always do that.
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.340]   "That's just, they're a bad apple.
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.620]   "That's the type of person they are."
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.540]   Toxic thought, Paul would say, "That's a knife."
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.380]   You've got to remove that from your thinking.
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.840]   You've got to choose to believe the best.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.020]   When you can't, you expose it and say,
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.460]   "I can't believe the best right now."
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.300]   Toxic thought.
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.120]   Here's another one.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.900]   If you found yourself obsessing over
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.660]   why you didn't get invited on that trip,
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.680]   obsessing over why you weren't invited to that dinner,
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.580]   toxic thought, you'd say, "Remove it."
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.980]   Another one that can be common is just,
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.820]   if you've ever found yourself living in what I would say
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.460]   is kind of the what if mentality, which is just fear,
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.780]   but it's like, "Oh my goodness, what if I never get married?
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.120]   "What if my mom doesn't recover?
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.580]   "What if I lose my job?"
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.420]   Toxic thought.
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.940]   You've got to identify it, remove it,
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.560]   say, "I'm not going to dwell on that.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.080]   "This will not control me.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.880]   "I am taking back control over the thoughts that I have."
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.660]   Another one, dwelling on your appearance
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.320]   or really wishing that you looked like someone else.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.140]   And when you look in the mirror,
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.820]   and it's never that blatant, like, "Oh my gosh, it's you."
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.860]   It's never popping up on your shoulder, talking to you.
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.820]   It's just this looming thought of,
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.120]   "Man, I don't like who I am."
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.780]   Knife, toxic thought.
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.280]   You've got to remove it.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.120]   You've got to remove it.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.380]   And we're gonna talk a little bit about how
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.980]   and what that exactly looks like,
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.340]   but you are either gonna take your thoughts captive,
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.980]   like he says here,
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.540]   or your thoughts are gonna take you captive.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.820]   And here's the thing that I don't know,
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.860]   no matter how hard I try to convince you,
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.660]   many of you will not believe me.
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.940]   You can control the thoughts that you think,
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.940]   the thoughts that you dwell on.
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.500]   Our world around us says, "Hey, you can't control that,
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.180]   "and you're not in the driver's seat.
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.980]   "It relates to what you think about."
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.100]   You can control what you think about.
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.740]   Paul just said, "We take every thought captive."
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.900]   Our thoughts don't take us captive.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:54.740]   I am choosing.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.780]   I will not be owned by this.
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:57.860]   And we're gonna talk a little bit more
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.740]   about what those things and how we can experience
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.620]   taking control back from our thoughts.
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.340]   But let me just do this before we move on.
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.420]   Let's just audit a little bit
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.220]   some of the thoughts that we have,
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.540]   because if you're inside of the room,
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.380]   the thoughts that you have every single day
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.540]   are shaping the person that you are becoming.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.220]   They are taking you to a destination.
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.500]   You're getting on a train.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.060]   So let's think in the last 24 hours,
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.300]   I wrote out three categories or scenarios.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.900]   As it relates to the thought that you have,
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.700]   the thoughts that you've had in the last 24 hours,
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.260]   here's a question for you.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.860]   Were the thoughts you had over the past 24 hours,
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.060]   were they more worried thoughts or peaceful thoughts?
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.500]   The last 24 hours.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.860]   Were they more worried or peaceful?
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.020]   The thoughts over the last 24 hours,
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.340]   were they more negative or positive?
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.620]   Was they more prone to negatively interpret,
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.140]   to step on that negative train?
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.380]   And when you step on that train,
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.780]   it just goes further and further,
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.940]   further down the negative road.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.540]   Everything else, it gets worse and worse and worse.
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.140]   Were the thoughts over the last 24 hours,
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.460]   were they more worldly or eternal?
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:06.340]   It is impossible to live a positive life
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.500]   with negative thinking.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.660]   Is it impossible?
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.980]   It is impossible to live an eternal,
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:17.620]   an eternal mindset life with worldly thinking.
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.900]   And it is impossible to live a life filled with peace,
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.100]   with anxious thoughts and anxious thinking.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:23.980]   And the Apostle Paul says,
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.460]   "You've gotta take those things captive.
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.780]   "You remove every single toxic thought."
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.340]   Some of you, this means you've got to remove
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.220]   some of the things in your life
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.900]   that are fueling the toxic thoughts.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.340]   Like here's the true story.
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.780]   There are friends that you have,
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.020]   let's say you struggle with anxiety,
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.060]   let's say you struggle with lust,
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.300]   let's say you struggle with whatever it is.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.740]   There are friends inside of the room,
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.660]   friends in your life, maybe they're not here tonight,
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.140]   maybe they're just in your life in general,
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.220]   and they're not helping you get off the wrong train
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.260]   and get on the right one.
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.700]   They're helping you stay on the right train.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.700]   They're like, "Dude, we're on the train to anxiety
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.300]   "and let's just feed off of one another
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.500]   "and I can't believe it, or the train of jealousy,
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.020]   "and let's just feed off of one another,
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.440]   "the train of gossip.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.860]   "Let's just feed off of one another."
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.380]   And you gotta make sure you don't have people around you
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.140]   that are pulling you on that train.
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:12.160]   The other thing is just the things that you're consuming.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.100]   The things that you're consuming
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.100]   are filling your mind with those thoughts,
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.740]   and those thoughts are a train that lead to a destination.
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.900]   What are some examples of that?
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.740]   Pornography, we talk about all the time.
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.420]   That if you fill your mind with lustful thoughts,
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.380]   it's going to take you in the direction of a destination
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:31.040]   of lust-filled desires and acting out on those things,
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.420]   of being unable to experience what God's desire
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.040]   and plan for sexuality really is.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.220]   If you fill your mind with,
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.220]   there's so many different things,
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.780]   and some of them are not even that blatant.
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.100]   Some of you need to get off social media
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.460]   because every time you get on there,
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.500]   you're filled with thoughts about how much you don't have
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.340]   and how much you don't have,
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.420]   and I can't believe that she,
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.100]   and you're insecure about what you look like
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.860]   because she always posts these pictures
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.760]   in these short skirts, dresses,
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.940]   whatever girls wear, okay?
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.660]   Some of you need to get off dating apps, like for real.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.060]   Like you're on dating apps, and you're a different person.
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.940]   You're checking it every three seconds.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.580]   You're like, oh my gosh, did he like me again?
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:08.860]   And I can't believe that he didn't like me.
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:10.240]   I've liked him five times.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.160]   And you need to get off of it because it is changing you,
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.020]   and you are filling your mind with things
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.580]   that are distracting you,
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.060]   and you need to take those thoughts captive,
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.220]   and one of the ways you take them captive
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.260]   is by saying, hey, I'm not gonna consume that stuff.
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.060]   Some of it's like neutral, like Narcos,
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.740]   or just shows on Netflix where you're like,
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.780]   hey, it's just filling my mind with bad things.
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.940]   I'm more anxious because of the things that I'm consuming.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.780]   So Paul says, in order to experience
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:36.780]   and win the battle in your mind,
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.100]   it's gotta include removing toxic thoughts from your life.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.740]   The second step he lays out in Philippians chapter four,
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.240]   book of Philippians, Paul writes from a jail cell.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.460]   And so he writes out these words,
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.060]   and he's arrested for his faith,
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.220]   and he's thrown in a jail cell.
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.540]   He's chained to a Roman prisoner, I'm sorry, a Roman guard,
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.020]   and he writes out these different words
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.460]   to the Philippian church.
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:01.500]   It says this, "Finally, brothers and sisters,
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.160]   "whatever is true, whatever is noble,
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.580]   "whatever is right, whatever is pure,
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.320]   "whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable,
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.520]   "if anything is excellent or praiseworthy,
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.920]   "think about such things."
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.500]   Paul says, "Fix your attention on these things."
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.420]   That there's not only stuff that we need to get rid of
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.780]   in our life, and we're gonna arrest that,
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:23.860]   and that's not coming in.
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.500]   There's also things that we need to fill
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.940]   and dwell on over and over and over again.
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.060]   Rehearse and replay in our mind.
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.620]   He says, "Whatever is true, whatever is noble, right,
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.360]   "whatever is pure, lovely, admirable,"
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.300]   which is just like full of worship or worthy of worship.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.420]   You could say heavenly.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.900]   It says, "Begin to think about these things.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.900]   "Think about what is true.
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.320]   "Think about who God is.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.340]   "Think about the truths that are contained in God's word."
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.040]   Those are the things to dwell on.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.060]   And not fill your mind with toxic thoughts.
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.660]   The second idea is to replace the lies with the truth.
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.340]   If you wanna win the battle of the mind,
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.820]   it involves replacing the lies with the truth.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:00.060]   I need to identify when I am beginning to believe a lie.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.860]   I am wanting to get on this train.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.140]   And I need to have others around me,
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.920]   and really take the steps to replace the lie with the truth.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.000]   Imagine what your life would look like
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.540]   if you really applied these verses.
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.660]   Imagine what today would've looked like
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.660]   if everywhere that you went,
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:17.980]   every thought that you had at work,
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.340]   you're sitting there, you're making widgets
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.420]   or whatever you do for a job,
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.460]   and you're doing Excel spreadsheets,
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.500]   and you're just sitting there,
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.980]   and the only things that filled your mind were like,
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.100]   man, God is so good, I'm so thankful,
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.220]   it's another day, I'm alive, God is for me,
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.420]   he put me here on purpose, he is at work in my life,
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.740]   he's gonna complete the good works
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.860]   that he started inside of me,
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.340]   he's never gonna leave me, forsake me,
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.520]   all these things, these are what flooded your mind.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.620]   How filled with peace would you be?
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.960]   How unfrustrated would you be
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.720]   when a coworker interrupts you or annoys you
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.320]   or does that thing that typically annoys you?
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.600]   How much of your life would change?
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.380]   How much of your self-talk,
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.880]   the things that you say to yourself, would change?
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.160]   If you really filled your mind with these things,
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.440]   like those are the things I'm gonna dwell on,
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.180]   if it's not that, nope, thank you, next, we are moving on.
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.680]   I mean, think about it.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.680]   And the Apostle Paul says,
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.320]   man, think and dwell on these things.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.800]   There should be nothing in your life that you dwell on.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.000]   It may pop in, you may think on it,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.500]   nothing you dwell on that is not here,
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.800]   that is not found in God's word,
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.880]   that's not from the truth that we see in God's word.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.800]   I don't know what lies you're tempted to believe
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.820]   that you need to replace with truth.
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.640]   I can tell you one of the biggest ones for me
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.040]   is the lie that, man, David,
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.840]   you are never gonna be good enough.
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.860]   No matter how hard you try, you are gonna fail.
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:45.580]   And you are a failure, you'll always be a failure,
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:46.420]   and you'll never be good enough.
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.260]   And you know what, you can work really hard at work,
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.860]   and you're gonna fail your family.
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.440]   Or you could be amazing with your family,
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.940]   and you're gonna fail at work.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.100]   You're never gonna be good enough.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.180]   Here's why that lie is so powerful for me.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.740]   Because there's truth in it.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:05.180]   I'm never gonna be good enough.
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.480]   I am not good enough, I'm not enough on my own.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.180]   And there's a small bit of truth,
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.300]   but it's only half the truth.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.780]   Because the Bible says that through Christ,
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.340]   I am more than enough.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.940]   Through Christ, I have everything that I need.
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.300]   Through Christ, when I am weak,
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.300]   if I am not enough, he is made strong,
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.180]   the Bible says in 2 Corinthians chapter 12.
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.780]   That his power is made perfect
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.560]   in not enough people like me.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.440]   And so if that's where I am,
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.900]   a fuller expression of the truth
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.780]   is what I need in that midst of the lie.
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:36.620]   Here's what I know about you,
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:37.740]   the lies that you're tempted to believe,
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.420]   the reason they have power or they grab at your heart
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.740]   is there's some truth in them.
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:46.380]   And what you need to do is not give some sort of positive,
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.660]   like, you know what, you, like here,
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.500]   I wrote out some of them.
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.500]   Like maybe the lie that you believe is,
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.300]   hey, I'll always be single and alone on Valentine's Day.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.600]   Maybe that's the lie you believe.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.100]   And the reason it's powerful is because there's some truth.
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.140]   You may always be single
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.900]   and not in a relationship on Valentine's Day.
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.140]   That's the truth.
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.020]   But it's not all the truth.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.500]   The further truth is that God says,
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.180]   "Through Christ, you have everything that you need.
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.340]   "He will supply all of your needs.
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.660]   "He will never leave you nor forsake you.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.440]   "If you have Jesus, you have never been alone
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.380]   "and you never will be alone.
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.960]   "And you have the thing that will satisfy you
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.500]   "like no man ever will or no woman ever will."
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.300]   And so it's not just, what I'm saying is,
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.280]   when it comes to like, hey, I need to combat the lies
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.380]   that I believe with the truth,
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.220]   I'm not just saying, hey,
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.900]   you need to just pick a Bible verse
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.060]   and then hold onto that in those times of trouble.
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.300]   You need to tell yourself the truth.
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.780]   I may have cancer.
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.560]   I may.
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.140]   But God has promised that he is in control.
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.340]   He's working for my good.
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.160]   He loves me.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.520]   He has plans to prosper me, not to harm me.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.540]   Anything that he allows to come through his hands
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.780]   are for my good and for his purposes.
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.680]   And I can trust him.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.460]   Or I can just worry about it and be anxious
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.320]   and fill my mind with toxic thoughts.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:59.360]   And you need to tell yourself the truth.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.200]   What are some other ones?
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.300]   I can't change.
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.140]   You can't change.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:03.980]   That's true.
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.580]   But over and over, the Bible teaches
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.300]   that Christ can change you and he will
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.980]   if you surrender and walk with him.
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:11.820]   Another truth.
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.040]   Man, what if my boyfriend cheats on me?
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.100]   I could come up here and I could just say,
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.740]   it would be awesome to be a pastor and be like,
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.220]   dude, here's the promise of God.
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.420]   He'll never cheat on you.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.700]   He'll never abandon you.
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.140]   It'll be enough every time.
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.240]   That's not true.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.340]   He may cheat on you.
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.380]   First, you shouldn't date guys who may cheat on you.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:36.220]   And the second is, man, don't ever put your hope
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:41.300]   in a man or in a woman other than Christ.
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.980]   And so you've gotta embrace whatever,
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.500]   I don't know about the lies that you're tempted to believe.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.780]   I don't know what the strongholds
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.600]   that you gotta have truth in order to demolish them are.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.140]   But you need to know the truth.
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.900]   And it is in confronting those things
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.380]   you'll experience a freedom.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:01.020]   Maybe the lie is, hey, my friends don't care about me.
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.580]   And again, I could just stand up here and be like,
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:03.900]   of course they care about you.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.500]   Every person with the spirit of God cares about you.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.400]   They may not care about you.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.460]   But you can either say, man, they may not.
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.300]   But you know what?
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.500]   I'm here to serve, not to be served,
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.400]   and I'm gonna care about them.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.940]   That's what I'm on this planet to do, care for people.
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.620]   And so the choice is yours,
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.860]   and you gotta confront it with the truth from God's word
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.440]   and align that with just reality around us.
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.260]   But finally, my value is in how I look,
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.280]   where I work, and what I earn.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.500]   A lot of us can struggle with that.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.340]   I know I can.
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.500]   And here's the truth.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.620]   Your value is in where you work,
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.500]   how much you earn, and how you look to the world.
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.860]   Let me say it another way.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.500]   To people whose opinions don't matter.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.320]   To people whose opinions won't last.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:57.640]   But your worth, in the truest sense,
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.680]   has already been defined by God of the universe,
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.580]   saying I find you so valuable,
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.520]   I will give my own life for you.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.720]   That's how much you are worth.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.400]   And it has nothing to do with how you look,
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.360]   how much you earn, and where you work.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.580]   But the truth is not to say, like,
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.720]   no, that stuff doesn't matter.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.520]   It matters a lot to worldly people who don't know Jesus.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.200]   And every day, you're gonna be bombarded with people
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.560]   who are like, this is what matters in life,
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.920]   and you've got to hold onto the truth.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.120]   It matters to them.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.920]   Am I gonna let it matter to me?
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.240]   Am I gonna let it define who I am?
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.040]   Or am I gonna let Jesus, and what he did on the cross,
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.020]   define who I am?
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.000]   And that's a choice you have to make.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.680]   But all of us can experience winning the battle of the mind
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.960]   if you remove toxic thoughts,
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.520]   and if you replace the lies with the truth.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.080]   When I was on the subway,
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.720]   here's what, like, is encouraging to me,
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.760]   is the more that you embrace God's truth
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.960]   in the midst of the lie,
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.560]   the easier it becomes for your mind to run to the truth.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.680]   In those moments where I'm tempted
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.320]   to get on the train of anxiety,
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.000]   it becomes easier to, God is with me, he's for me,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.360]   I can trust him, he's in control, I've never had control.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.400]   That's an illusion and a myth.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.340]   God loves me, I can have peace.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.120]   Because everything is sifting through his hands,
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.360]   and he is for me.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.800]   The more that I rehearse and ingrain that in my mind
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.520]   and believe that, the easier it becomes
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.240]   when I'm tempted, in order to get on that anxiety train,
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.880]   to run to the train of truth.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.600]   And the more that you continue to renew your mind,
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.040]   combat the lies with the truth, the easier it becomes.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.240]   It's not dissimilar to this.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.600]   When I was running around on the subway,
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.000]   or when I was riding around on the subway,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.160]   there are times where I was like,
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.840]   oh no, I'm on the wrong train here.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.960]   You know what didn't happen a lot?
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.000]   I was with a friend who lives up in that city.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.560]   He never got on the wrong train.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.800]   He lives there every single day.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.720]   If he got on it, he knew immediately,
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.880]   oh man, I'm on the wrong train.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.560]   I gotta get back on the A train.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.960]   And he would quickly get off,
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.220]   'cause he had familiarized himself with it.
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.680]   This is how science, neuroscience,
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.920]   which is the study of the brain,
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.360]   says your brain actually works.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.000]   It's just aligning with God's word.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.120]   In Romans chapter 12, it said,
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.240]   "When you renew your mind,
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.040]   "it changes the way that you think."
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.620]   You create neural pathways, if you will,
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.560]   that make it easier to run to that truth every single time,
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.600]   the more that you do it.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.460]   And it weakens the power of the lie,
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.360]   makes it less likely to run to that.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.280]   Science is saying, this is how your mind works.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.760]   And the more that you renew your mind
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.420]   around the truth from God's word and reject the lie,
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:28.480]   it gets only easier and easier.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.080]   In the same way, it's also true
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.640]   that there are gonna be times where,
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.480]   because either you don't know God's word enough,
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.600]   so you need to read God's word
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.040]   if you're gonna combat the lie with the truth.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:38.880]   There's gonna be other times
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.120]   where you're just at a place where you're like,
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.340]   man, I'm stuck.
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.700]   I don't know how to get off this train.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.080]   I don't wanna be on this train.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.400]   It's a depression train,
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.040]   and I don't know how to get off of here.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.400]   And so I don't know what else to do.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.360]   And what do you do?
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.080]   Very similar to in that situation.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.800]   In New York, my wife and I
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.240]   headed to the Christmas tree lighting.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.520]   Here's what's true about subways.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.920]   This is like a subway message, train message.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.460]   They're never like perfect.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.160]   There's always construction going on,
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.960]   on the Green Line one,
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.560]   and there's always just something off.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.400]   And then they operate between hours of like,
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.000]   between 1 p.m. and 2 a.m., no train going here.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.100]   So there's just times you're like,
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.600]   I literally don't know what to do.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.440]   I'm looking at it,
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.560]   and the option that we had is not working now,
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.400]   so what do we do?
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.320]   What did I do?
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.120]   I asked those around me.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.840]   I brought others in, said, I don't know, I'm stuck.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.920]   I don't wanna be on this train.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.200]   I don't wanna go to this destination.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.480]   I wanna go to that destination.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.360]   Will you help me?
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.960]   This is what you have got to do
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.240]   if you're gonna win the battle of your mind,
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.880]   because you will not always be able to know,
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.520]   I can't get on the right train.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.120]   I want to fight this lie,
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.720]   I just don't know how to right now.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.160]   And you gotta bring others in along the journey
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.000]   as we help one another.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.160]   That's how God created and wired us to work.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:55.480]   Finally, the third idea,
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.600]   as it relates to winning the battle in your mind,
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.120]   it comes from the same chapter of Philippians,
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.120]   where he says this.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:05.340]   Rejoice or have joy,
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.140]   be joyful in the Lord always.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:14.260]   I will say it again, be joyful or rejoice.
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.600]   I read this and I'm like,
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.160]   are you saying that joy is a choice, Paul?
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.280]   Like I can just choose to be joy?
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.800]   Are you writing this from Cancun or something
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.240]   with a Mai Tai in your hand?
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.880]   No, he's writing it with a armed man
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.640]   chained to him from a prison cell.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.480]   How can you write that, Paul?
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:37.160]   Because he doesn't say, hey, rejoice in all,
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.440]   or in the circumstances,
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.740]   it says in the Lord, in every circumstance.
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.360]   But the apostle Paul would say,
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.200]   hey, you have to choose joy.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.440]   The third thing, if you wanna win the battle in your mind,
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:55.520]   is you have to reframe with the right perspective.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.760]   What do I mean by that?
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.800]   I mean with an eternal perspective.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.200]   You can either choose to see the lens
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.600]   and kind of the world around you
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.480]   with an earthly perspective and with today,
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.640]   and this is always how it's gonna be,
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.200]   or with an eternal perspective.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.760]   The apostle Paul was able to choose joy
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.960]   because he maintained an eternal perspective.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.320]   He said, look, no matter what the situation is,
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.360]   because of the truths that I know,
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.500]   because of the fact that I'm gonna spend
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.880]   forever and ever and ever with God,
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.560]   that there's gonna come a day five billion years from now,
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.640]   I look back and the fact that I was chained to this,
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.740]   that Rocky over here was not that big of a deal,
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.440]   I can always choose joy no matter what
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.040]   because I know where my hope is.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.480]   And he would say, so can you.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.120]   Whatever situation you're in,
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.120]   you have an opportunity to reframe it
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.520]   with the right perspective around you.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.820]   Let me further illustrate what I mean by that.
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:49.260]   To choose to see the goodness of God
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.320]   and the best in the scenario around you.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.240]   And before you run off,
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.200]   let me explain a little bit more what I mean.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.040]   The apostle Paul, three chapters earlier,
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.280]   explained exactly what this looks like.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.720]   Where in the very first chapter of the book, he says this.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.760]   Now I want you to know brothers,
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.960]   this is Philippians 1, verse 12 and 13,
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.840]   that what has happened to me
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.280]   has actually served to advance the gospel.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.400]   And as a result, it has become clear
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.420]   throughout the entire palace guard
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.960]   and to everyone that I am in chains for Christ.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.920]   And because of my chains,
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.140]   most of the brothers and sisters
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.560]   have become confident in the Lord
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.000]   and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Paul says, hey, most people, I'm sitting here,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.240]   I'm locked up next to Rocky and I'm sitting here,
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.840]   I'm in chains, I'm thrown away.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.780]   And most people be like, hey, where's God now?
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:31.840]   What are you doing?
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.000]   I'm so angry, this is terrible, I'm just upset.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.460]   And he says, this is amazing.
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:39.000]   I have a chance where every eight hours,
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.760]   I'll get a new guy, they would change up the guard
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:41.820]   every eight hours and they come in
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.680]   and I have a captive audience literally,
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.780]   and I tell them about Jesus.
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:47.360]   And now the entire imperial guard knows about Jesus,
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.120]   what he just said.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.240]   That even in the midst of a circumstance,
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.600]   everyone would be like, dude, that is bad,
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.440]   we need to pray for him.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.640]   He's like, this is great.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.160]   I get one guy after the next, after the next,
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.400]   and they're all coming to know
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.300]   at least the Jesus that I talk about.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:02.840]   He was able to see and reframe it with the right perspective
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:06.160]   that even some of the worst moments
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.120]   or most mundane, trivial moments, frustrating moments
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.700]   that I can choose and I must choose
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.120]   to look for the goodness of God around me.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:19.360]   It's not dissimilar to this, in case you're not following me.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.480]   It's like, it's a little bit of what we do
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.840]   when we choose the right filter on Instagram.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.200]   You guys know what I mean by that?
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.240]   Here's what I mean.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.080]   Is whenever I take a picture,
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:35.260]   you guys know what the most popular filter is on Instagram?
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.060]   Anyone know?
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.140]   Claritin, whatever that is.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.560]   Claritin is the most popular.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.020]   And here's really, I think,
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:47.500]   the filter that you choose in the room, let's be honest.
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.420]   How do you choose the filter that you use?
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:51.780]   Whichever one you look best in.
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.460]   That's where you're like, no, not as good.
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.740]   I'm like, I haven't seen the sun in a year in that one.
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.300]   Okay, move to that one, that one, that one.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.620]   And you choose a filter based on
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.700]   whichever one makes it look the best, right?
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:04.120]   Like, here we go, we'll just, look good, here we go.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.480]   And there you are.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.240]   Then I would go, and I'm gonna take this,
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.240]   and I'm gonna be like, man, not that one, not that one.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.040]   Oh, oh, that's not good.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.360]   And I would choose the right filter
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.840]   based on whichever one looks best,
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.880]   or is the best looking.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.320]   In the same way, the Apostle Paul would say,
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.200]   hey, you do not have a choice over everything
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.120]   that you're gonna face in life,
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.320]   but you have a choice over the filter
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.760]   that you're gonna place on it.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.800]   And you can choose the best looking one
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.200]   and seek to see the goodness of God
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.000]   no matter what's going on around you.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.360]   Or you can choose to see the filter
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.080]   just like the world's evil, but you can choose joy.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:42.920]   What does this look like?
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.600]   I gave some practical, let me give you some practical
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.960]   examples of what I mean by that.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.960]   Maybe you found, like, hey, my car is in the shop.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.360]   That's a down, that's a bummer of a day.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.220]   My car, it may be totaled, I don't know what's going on.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.720]   My engine's having trouble.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.640]   I can choose to be angry, or I can choose to say,
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.040]   man, God, thank you that I even have a car.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.120]   Like, 2% of the world has a car.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.220]   Thank you that I have a car that can even go to the shop.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.640]   Maybe your dishwasher, you came home tonight,
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.600]   your dishwasher's broke.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.120]   You can either choose to be like, man,
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.680]   what in the world, God, I thought it was following you
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:13.080]   at the porch tonight, or you can choose to say,
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.600]   all right, God, my dishwasher's broken.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.100]   I guess I'll have more time to listen to a porch sermon
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.720]   as I wash these dishes by hand.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.560]   I mean, think about it.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.120]   Maybe you're sick, and my response is like,
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.760]   oh, man, I can't believe I'm sick.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.540]   Or I could say, I'm sick, God, thank you for sickness
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.680]   'cause it reminds me to be thankful
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.040]   for all the days where I'm not and I'm healthy.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.480]   Or, hey, you're at the office,
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.720]   and they had this big party and cake.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.600]   They brought cake in, and everyone ate the cake
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.440]   before you got there.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.260]   You can either choose to be like,
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:44.280]   man, these people, unbelievable,
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.880]   or you can just say, it's probably good.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.440]   I didn't need that cake, okay?
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.280]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.500]   I don't need more cake in my life, and I'm thankful.
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:57.400]   Whatever situation, you will not choose
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.160]   the things that you face in life, and those are trivial,
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.880]   but you can choose how you frame it
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.320]   and the filter you put on it.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:07.400]   Just like with the Instagram, we look for the best looking.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.960]   Because of God, his promises,
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.540]   our eternal security that we have,
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:13.820]   no matter what we face in this life,
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:14.760]   he's working for our good.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.520]   You can choose to look for the goodness of God
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.940]   in every situation.
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.760]   Inside of the room, I know that some of the things
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.280]   that I just described, they pale in comparison
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.520]   to things that you're walking through,
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.520]   circumstances that you're facing right now.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.160]   And so me talking about a dishwasher being broken,
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.880]   like my mom's got brain cancer.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.040]   I don't have a job.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.800]   My fiance and me just broke up.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.160]   My whole world just changed.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.440]   You tell me, like, put the right filter on it?
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.120]   And I don't wanna pretend that I know everything
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.320]   and every emotion that you're feeling
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.080]   and everything that you're walking through.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.420]   And I'm also not just saying, well, hey, man,
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.040]   just be positive and everything will look up.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.420]   'Cause I, like you, walk through things
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.400]   and hear through stories and experience things
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.440]   in my own life where I'm like, man,
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.000]   I cannot see exactly what God is doing here.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.480]   I'm not smart enough to know how you're gonna redeem
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:10.960]   someone being molested.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:16.000]   But I know this, there will come a day
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.200]   where according to Ecclesiastes chapter three,
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.480]   for even the things in this life
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.920]   where like, that doesn't make sense, God,
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.020]   I don't know what you're doing there.
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.120]   We will see everything made beautiful in its time.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.360]   That's what the verse says.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.720]   Ecclesiastes chapter three.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.120]   And that truth along with the truth in Romans chapter eight
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.640]   that everything, if you are a follower of Jesus
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.000]   in your life is gonna be made to work for your good.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.040]   And God is using that inside of your life.
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.440]   It's not dissimilar to this and I'll close here.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:46.120]   When I was in school or there was a time
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.560]   after I actually graduated from school,
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.760]   I got invited to go to a football game for my alma mater.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.480]   And I was given tickets and I got to sit
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.080]   on kind of the front second row and I was down on eye level.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.840]   And all of a sudden the halftime, the band came out
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.820]   and the band came out.
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.040]   And what happens when the band,
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.520]   they start doing like a choreographed thing.
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.020]   When you're looking at it from the ground level,
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.280]   it looks like chaos.
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.480]   You're like, what is going on right now?
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.760]   Like the tuba is about to take over the xylophone
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.040]   and the clarinets over here.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.600]   Do they even have clarinets in these things?
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.240]   And it just looks like total chaos from the ground level.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.600]   And then you look up at the screen and you see,
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.760]   oh, it's spelling something out.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.000]   It was all purposeful.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.120]   It looked chaotic.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.080]   It looked random.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.200]   It looked, what?
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.780]   And then up at the screen, when you see it from above,
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.940]   it's totally different.
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:37.540]   I know that some people in this room
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:41.180]   are holding onto something that I have no idea
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:44.220]   how God, when we see it from above,
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:49.240]   is gonna make us all go, wow, it's totally different.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:52.660]   He allowed it, he didn't cause it.
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.500]   There was a purpose even in the pain.
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:59.760]   I further know that because we saw it
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.300]   ultimately on the cross.
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:05.880]   The son of God becomes a man, comes to earth,
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.740]   lives a perfect life, goes around,
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.360]   never sins, never does anything wrong.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.520]   What does he do his entire life?
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.480]   Spends it pouring himself out for humanity.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.960]   He allows blind people to see.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.280]   He allows lame people to walk.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.120]   He heals people.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.760]   He restores families, transforms the area in which he lived.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.440]   And one day he's betrayed by all of his friends
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.480]   or abandoned by all of them, betrayed by one of them.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.220]   He's taken before a crowd, he's wrongfully accused,
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.160]   and the crowd cries out, "Crucify this man."
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.700]   That's a bad day.
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:38.400]   And he's led away, he's crucified on a hill called Calvary,
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.260]   and he dies a brutal death
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:44.820]   at the hands of men he created
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.420]   and formed in their mother womb.
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:50.100]   Being held up by a cross made of wood
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:53.720]   that he fashioned the tree and created and gave life to it.
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:55.540]   It's a bad day,
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:39:00.080]   depending on how you frame it.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.580]   Because it's also the greatest day,
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.540]   the greatest evil act in human history.
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.660]   Humanity, the creation, killing their creator
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:12.260]   would also become the greatest act in all of human history,
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:13.580]   the greatest day in human history,
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.700]   because it's not just the day that Jesus died,
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.860]   it's the day that death died
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.360]   and where God entered into the world and said,
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.700]   "I will provide a way.
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.660]   "I will give a sacrifice of myself
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.340]   "so that anyone who trusts in me,
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.540]   "not in themself, can have eternal life."
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:30.220]   It's all how you frame it.
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:34.500]   And some of you inside of this room,
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.020]   what you need to know more than anything else,
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.380]   all the truths we talked about, about winning your mind,
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.260]   about recognizing the thoughts you have,
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.380]   removing the toxic ones,
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.500]   about replacing the lie with the truth,
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.820]   about reframing it in light of God's eternal perspective.
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:49.420]   The truth that you need to know more than anything else
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.300]   is not that you need to get off the train of anxiety.
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.220]   You were born into this world as a child of wrath,
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.060]   the Bible says.
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.220]   You were on a train from the moment
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:57.460]   you breathed your first breath
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:01.020]   to the sins that put you into who you are today,
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.060]   the sins that you've created,
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:05.240]   placed you on a train, not to anxiety, but to hell.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.900]   And there was only one remedy to get off that train,
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:11.380]   and that is to put yourself underneath the trust
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:15.340]   or put your trust in the Savior who died in your place,
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:19.420]   who came to defeat death,
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.940]   to offer eternal life to you and to me
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:21.980]   and anyone who will accept it.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.460]   Do you have, according to the Bible,
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:26.740]   have your mind, your mind has been blinded.
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:27.580]   That's what it says.
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:28.540]   2 Corinthians chapter four says,
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.780]   the mind of unbelievers,
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.820]   if you're not a believer in Jesus,
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.540]   your mind has been blinded, the Bible says.
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:38.560]   And it's blinded you from being able to see
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:42.380]   the goodness of God and the glory of God in Jesus
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.940]   and the work that he did on the cross.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.020]   And today that God is inviting you.
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.260]   I wanna have a relationship with you.
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.740]   I went to such great lengths to die for you.
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.820]   Will you accept the hands that are reaching out to you,
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.300]   the hands that reached a part for you,
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.660]   will you accept that offer?
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.820]   And if you do, you will have eternal life.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.040]   And if you don't, you will stay on that train.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:01.940]   And he offers it to you.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.260]   And here's the truth, man.
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:07.340]   You will never now be able to stand before God someday.
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:08.900]   If you're like, man, I don't know if I believe that,
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.380]   I'm not really sure, I don't know what I believe.
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:12.220]   I know this at least,
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:14.340]   you will never again be able to stand before God
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.740]   and say, man, I never heard about Jesus.
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.380]   I never knew he was the only way.
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:23.060]   Because God will say, man, on February 12th, 2019,
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.780]   you heard about the savior of the world,
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:26.660]   who came for you.
[00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:29.440]   Will you accept him?
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.900]   For the rest of us, the voice is ours.
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.380]   Will we win the battle in our mind
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.600]   by removing toxic thoughts,
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.020]   replacing the lies with the truth,
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.180]   and reframing it in light of the goodness of God
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.060]   with an eternal perspective?
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:41.900]   Let me pray.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:48.460]   Father, I wanna pray for two groups of people.
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:51.860]   And the first is those who I know inside of the room
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:52.700]   don't know you.
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:56.980]   And they have never had a moment where they have,
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.000]   through faith, trusted in Christ.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.140]   I pray that right now, wherever they're seated,
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.260]   they would maybe for the first time just say,
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.540]   Lord, I believe that I'm a sinner.
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.060]   You died for my sin.
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.520]   I trust not in how good I am, but in you.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.540]   Dying in my place and rising from the grave, that alone.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.860]   And I pray that that truth, which is,
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.260]   there's no magic prayer, magic words,
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:26.220]   but words that reflect a heart that trusts,
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.680]   a mind that trusts,
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:33.020]   form the beginning of a relationship.
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.080]   And I pray that all over this room,
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.420]   that would break out in the second group.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.620]   I wanna pray for people who are walking
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.380]   through the valley of the shadow of cancer,
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.820]   the shadow of heartache and heartbreak,
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:49.420]   the valley of betrayal, abandonment, pain, God.
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:55.020]   That you would be in this moment
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.940]   and in moments going forward, more real than them,
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.540]   or more real to them than the pain.
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.900]   That you would eclipse those things in their mind.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:07.540]   They would recognize toxic thoughts.
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:08.860]   They would be able to give,
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:10.720]   or you would give them the grace to reframe
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.700]   no matter what situation they're walking in.
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.460]   And they would hold fast onto you.
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:17.340]   Would you replace the lies that we all believe
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:18.840]   with the truth from your word?
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:22.620]   Thank you for Jesus, we worship you in song, amen.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.200]   (upbeat music)
