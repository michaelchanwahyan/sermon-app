1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,620
 All right, well, here we go.

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,180
 We are wrapping up this series, Fact Check.

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,940
 I've got a handful of friends from our staff team tonight

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,260
 that are up here on the stage with me.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,920
 And let me start by framing up the night

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,620
 with a recent story, actually from yesterday in my own life.

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,660
 I got up work, went home, walked in the door,

9
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,500
 it's early evening, and my son is right by the door

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,980
 and he almost greets me.

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,060
 And the first question that he asked is,

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,180
 "Daddy, do I have to get a spanking?"

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,900
 I have no context for why he's asking me this.

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,220
 And this is really the first time

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,560
 at this moment type of thing.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,900
 He's a four-year-old kid.

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,340
 In fact, here's a picture of him

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,500
 and his sister, Monroe and crew.

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,940
 And he's looking at me and he's asking me that.

20
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,220
 And I look at his mom and I say,

21
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,260
 "I don't know, does he have to get a spanking?"

22
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,820
 And she says, "Yes, we've had a bad day.

23
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,380
 We've not been listening, we've been arguing."

24
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,500
 And I told him, "When daddy gets home,

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,180
 you're getting a spanking."

26
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,140
 Now, this was the first time I'd ever had this experience.

27
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,940
 Like I'd been on the receiving end of this scenario

28
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,440
 many, many times where I was the little child

29
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,780
 or the kid growing up who was told by their mom,

30
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,100
 "Hey, when daddy gets home, you're gonna get the belt,

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,060
 you're gonna get spanking."

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,460
 And this is Texas people, so we still spank here.

33
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,540
 And I was very familiar with just that experience.

34
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,020
 I'd never been on the other side

35
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,380
 of what it was like to be the dad who was just getting home

36
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,820
 and what all the different emotions and thoughts

37
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,180
 kind of go through the head of that father.

38
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,480
 'Cause parents say things,

39
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,460
 if you remember growing up as a kid

40
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,420
 where they give you spankings,

41
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,820
 and they say things where you're like,

42
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,940
 "Is that really true?

43
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,060
 Is that really how you feel?"

44
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,220
 'Cause I'm not, honestly, I'm not convinced.

45
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,260
 Where they say things like this, like,

46
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,220
 "Hey, I have to give you a spanking

47
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,860
 and this hurts me more than it hurts you."

48
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,980
 'Cause as a kid, you're like,

49
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,900
 "I don't know that I believe that.

50
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,900
 I'm the only one leaving with red lines on my behind."

51
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,380
 And I'm the one in tears and you're not.

52
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,440
 But now I'm on my own dad side of this,

53
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,280
 where I'm going like,

54
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,140
 "Oh man, I have to give my son a spanking."

55
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,460
 And just all the emotions of like,

56
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,740
 it is true, parents, it's not a fun thing.

57
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,780
 I mean, Josiah's got kids, he knows what I'm talking about.

58
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,100
 It's not a fun thing to give your kids a spanking.

59
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,180
 I mean, my son, as you saw,

60
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,060
 like he's in the 98th percentile for height.

61
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,500
 He's scrawny, he doesn't have much padding on his behind.

62
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
 Giving spankings, it really is something

63
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,340
 he doesn't look forward to.

64
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,340
 And as a dad, I hate when consequences for his actions,

65
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,180
 his disobedience, leads to me having to punish him

66
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,020
 or having to spank him.

67
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,620
 And yet I know that it's a part of raising and growing

68
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,820
 and it gives us, honestly,

69
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,720
 it gives me a chance to talk through, you know,

70
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,900
 what it looks like to listen to mommy and daddy

71
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,760
 and consequences for our actions.

72
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,940
 But it is a hard and challenging thing

73
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,220
 just as a parent where you have to do it.

74
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,420
 Here's my point.

75
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,820
 Tonight, we're finishing the series

76
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,020
 where we are covering one of the most difficult objections

77
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,140
 to Christianity or putting on the stand

78
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,220
 as we have every single week in Fact Check,

79
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,400
 these different Christian beliefs.

80
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,900
 And tonight is a really challenging one for a lot of people.

81
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,340
 And that is how can a loving God allow people to go to hell?

82
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,740
 If he's a loving heavenly father,

83
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,140
 just like an earthly heavenly father,

84
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,540
 doesn't enjoy or doesn't like,

85
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,540
 or doesn't want to give even a spanking to his children,

86
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,980
 how can a perfect, loving, heavenly father

87
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,900
 be okay with a consequence

88
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,380
 for people being eternity away from him,

89
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,860
 experiencing the horror of hell?

90
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,580
 Like, how is that possible?

91
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,260
 Like, is that even really true?

92
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,580
 A lot of people like this is where they're like,

93
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,180
 hey, whatever Jesus is talking about,

94
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,460
 he can't actually be talking about hell.

95
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,660
 That's probably not actually true.

96
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,580
 A lot of people walk away from their faith

97
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,440
 because they can't get over this objection.

98
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,540
 So tonight we are putting to a test

99
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,020
 or checking the fact that God is love.

100
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,560
 He's a loving God and people go to hell.

101
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,420
 So we're gonna be in Luke chapter 16.

102
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,940
 If you have a Bible, you can flip open there.

103
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,640
 If not, it'll be up on the screens,

104
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,380
 but we're gonna cover and walk through

105
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,160
 some of Jesus's teaching on hell.

106
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,620
 Specifically, I wanna answer three things.

107
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,140
 What is hell?

108
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,260
 Who will be in hell?

109
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,300
 And how hell actually shows us the love of God.

110
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,760
 What is hell? Who will be in hell?

111
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,560
 And how hell shows us the love of God.

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,900
 If it's true, if you're skeptical,

113
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,880
 the answer to tonight's fact check

114
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,220
 has more significant consequences for you,

115
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,100
 for our world, for eternity,

116
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,520
 than any other question you will ever ponder.

117
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,320
 So maybe you're wondering like, ah, just, you know,

118
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,160
 I reject that.

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,960
 I at least want you to listen long enough to say,

120
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,560
 hey, if I'm gonna reject Christianity

121
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,080
 because of what it says about hell,

122
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,340
 I at least want you to know what it says about hell

123
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,460
 because it may surprise you.

124
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,780
 So we're gonna be in Luke chapter 16.

125
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,060
 If you have a Bible, I'm gonna start in verse 19.

126
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,260
 Jesus is teaching and he starts with a parable.

127
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,260
 What's a parable?

128
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,100
 It's just a story that he gives to make up a point

129
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,760
 or to prove a point.

130
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,500
 Jesus was a masterful storyteller

131
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,280
 and he's teaching this group of Pharisees,

132
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,340
 which were like this religious group

133
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,900
 that thought that they could have a relationship with God

134
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,860
 because they were good people.

135
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,100
 They were like, hey, we're pros on their business card.

136
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,120
 It says professional religious person

137
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,520
 and that's why God's gonna accept me.

138
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,720
 And over and over, Jesus is like, that's not how God works.

139
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,940
 And he launches into a conversation

140
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,640
 about heaven and hell with that group.

141
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,580
 And here's what he says.

142
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,720
 He starts and tells this story.

143
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,360
 There was a rich man who was dressed in purple

144
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,360
 and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.

145
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,240
 Side note, in this time, someone who was wealthy

146
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
 was often seen as blessed by God.

147
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,280
 So if you were rich,

148
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,300
 hey, it was because God's blessing was on you.

149
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,940
 If you were poor, it's because God clearly was not for you.

150
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,580
 So this guy, purple, like only the who's who

151
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,740
 got to wear purple because it was such an expensive thing.

152
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,220
 And so this guy dressed to the nines, very rich,

153
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,460
 culture would have assumed wrongly,

154
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,500
 oh man, God is clearly for that guy.

155
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,360
 At his gate laid a beggar named Lazarus,

156
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,180
 covered with sores,

157
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,660
 longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table.

158
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,520
 Even the dogs came and licked his sores.

159
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,400
 Jesus sets up a very clear contrast,

160
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,480
 super rich, super poor.

161
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,340
 The time came when the beggar died

162
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,680
 and the angels took him to Abraham's side.

163
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,340
 Abraham's side is just a word that Jesus' audience

164
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,280
 would have understood as like paradise.

165
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,240
 Father Abraham, kind of founder of the faith, if you will.

166
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,820
 Abraham's side or Abraham's bosom,

167
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,940
 your translation may have, it's just a word for paradise.

168
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,760
 It's like heaven today before the new heavens.

169
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,000
 So it's just basically, he's taken to heaven.

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,400
 The rich man also died and was buried

171
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,120
 in Hades where he was in torment.

172
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,560
 He looked up, Hades, he's in hell.

173
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,160
 He looked up and he saw Abraham far away

174
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,800
 with Lazarus by his side.

175
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,720
 So he called out to him,

176
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,180
 Father Abraham, have pity on me.

177
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,180
 Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water

178
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,160
 and come and cool my tongue

179
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,340
 because I'm in agony in this fire.

180
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,480
 But Abraham replied, son, remember that in your lifetime

181
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,800
 you received your good things

182
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,900
 while Lazarus received bad things.

183
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,440
 But now he is comforted here and you are in agony.

184
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,680
 And besides all of this, between us and you,

185
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,160
 a great chasm has been placed

186
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,040
 so that those who want to go from here to there cannot

187
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,800
 nor can anyone cross over from there to us.

188
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,920
 He answered, then father, I beg you,

189
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,360
 send Lazarus to my family.

190
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,880
 For I have five brothers, let him warn them

191
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,160
 so that they will not also come to this place

192
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,780
 of torment.

193
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,400
 Abraham replied, they have Moses and they have the prophets.

194
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,440
 Let them listen to them.

195
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,200
 No, father Abraham, he said,

196
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,080
 but if someone comes from the dead to them,

197
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,760
 they will repent.

198
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,200
 He said, if they do not listen to Moses and the prophets,

199
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,760
 they will not be convinced

200
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,800
 even if someone rises from the dead.

201
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,340
 Jesus is such a brilliant storyteller.

202
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,160
 There's so many, even foreshadowing

203
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,520
 his own raising from the dead, or he's gonna rise.

204
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,480
 And, but the thing I wanna really highlight

205
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,820
 is we launch into what does the Bible say about hell?

206
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,780
 Who's there?

207
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,480
 And how does it show us the love of God?

208
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,280
 Is a couple of things that we see inside of this passage.

209
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,440
 Basically, Jesus says, hey, there's a place called heaven.

210
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,560
 There's a place called hell.

211
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
 He gives two scenarios, two deaths,

212
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,820
 two different destinations, one of which was hell.

213
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,000
 One of the things that we learn

214
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,120
 underneath the first point of, hey, what is hell?

215
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,280
 So just get a big framework

216
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,000
 for what does the Bible teach about hell?

217
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,720
 It's a place that's absent of anything good.

218
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,140
 Abraham says, hey, you received your good things in life.

219
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,320
 He's bad, now it's the opposite.

220
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,680
 James chapter one, another book in the Bible,

221
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,120
 in the first chapter says, everything good in life

222
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,840
 comes from the father of lights.

223
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,240
 Heaven is a place where everything is good.

224
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,300
 Hell is a place where there is total absence

225
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,440
 of anything good.

226
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,240
 In other words, people will be like, hey, look,

227
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,160
 I'd rather go to hell with my buddies

228
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,280
 and have a beer with the devil

229
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,120
 than be up there playing a harp on a cloud.

230
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,480
 That's because they don't understand what hell is.

231
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,800
 There's no buddies in hell.

232
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,900
 There's no having a beer with the buddies.

233
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,320
 They have a fundamental misunderstanding

234
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,200
 'cause all of those are gifts and good things from God.

235
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,100
 And those are not present in hell.

236
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,960
 Hell is the absence of anything good.

237
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,160
 Hell is the separation.

238
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,280
 The second thing, just a few things.

239
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,440
 It's a separation from the presence of God.

240
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,140
 Second Thessalonians chapter one, verse eight and nine,

241
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,320
 the apostle Paul is writing, he's describing hell.

242
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,800
 Here's what he says.

243
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,160
 God will punish those who do not know God

244
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,280
 and who do not obey the gospel

245
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,000
 or the good news of our Lord Jesus.

246
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,920
 They will be punished with everlasting destruction

247
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,520
 and shut out from the presence of the Lord

248
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,920
 and the glory of his might.

249
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,840
 Heaven by definition is the presence of God.

250
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,180
 Hell is the separation from the presence of God.

251
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,020
 Third thing that you see,

252
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,480
 and this may be a helpful distinction really quickly

253
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,720
 is we're told hell is a place of torment, not torture.

254
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,560
 There's a big difference.

255
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,140
 Torture is external.

256
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,060
 Torment is internal.

257
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,640
 If I'm experiencing everlasting torment,

258
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,560
 there are internal things.

259
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,960
 Maybe it's, hey, I'm covered in shame and guilt.

260
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,680
 I'm covered in anxiety.

261
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,560
 I'm covered in fear.

262
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,360
 I'm covered with loneliness, paralyzing, crippling.

263
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,400
 It's internal.

264
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,920
 This is what it says in the verse.

265
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,440
 In Hades, where the rich man was in torment,

266
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,920
 torture is somebody on the outside poking you with a stick.

267
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,360
 Torment is an internal experience.

268
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,360
 Generally in the Bible, and most scholars believe,

269
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,760
 over and over, when Jesus says,

270
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,360
 he describes hell as a fire,

271
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,160
 he describes hell as like utter darkness,

272
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,800
 a place where the worm never dies.

273
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,520
 He describes it as gnashing of teeth

274
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,960
 and some really graphic language.

275
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,880
 And most people believe he's being metaphorical.

276
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,840
 He's saying it's terrible of a place as you can imagine.

277
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,380
 In other words, it's hard to reconcile.

278
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,160
 How could it be total fire and total darkness?

279
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,500
 Because fire brings light in the dark.

280
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,720
 The point, they're both imagery.

281
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,640
 Most people believe.

282
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,960
 Jesus is just describing a scenario where it's terrible

283
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,440
 because you're removed from the presence of God.

284
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,320
 And that darkness is total darkness figuratively

285
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,120
 because there's no presence of God.

286
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,000
 God is light.

287
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,540
 And so whatever it is, torment,

288
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,040
 and I'm not under or trying to invalidate

289
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,320
 the horribleness of hell.

290
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,420
 I mean, it's terrible.

291
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,280
 But there's a way in which it involves

292
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,640
 self-torment on the inside.

293
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,400
 Hell, finally, there's degrees of punishment.

294
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,760
 We don't have time to get into this right now.

295
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,460
 But one other thing just to know about hell

296
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,240
 is that it involves degrees of punishment.

297
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,180
 Read throughout the New Testament,

298
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,800
 Jesus over and over repeats,

299
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,280
 hey, based on the severity of someone's actions

300
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,640
 and the life that they lived,

301
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,600
 there will be corresponding punishments in their life.

302
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,880
 And finally, here's what hell is.

303
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,880
 And this will be really helpful for some of you

304
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,640
 because I'll be as bold to say,

305
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,640
 I don't know that you want a world without hell.

306
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,080
 Why do I say that?

307
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,920
 Hell displays the justice of God.

308
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,000
 Hell displays and puts in perspective

309
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,660
 and puts in account for every action

310
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,300
 and every evil and every harm

311
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,220
 and every messed up thing inside of our world.

312
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,060
 It will all be held to account.

313
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,140
 In other words, nobody gets away.

314
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,500
 Even if they get off scot-free,

315
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,820
 if they committed the crime,

316
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,480
 they will settle every crime

317
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,540
 and every sin will be paid for in hell.

318
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,780
 Every injustice in our world will be paid for in hell.

319
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,940
 Why do I say that you wouldn't want it?

320
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,580
 Like you think about the horrific actions

321
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,700
 that took place in the Holocaust,

322
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,800
 where millions of Jewish people

323
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,340
 were shoved into gas chambers

324
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,780
 and killed and exterminated to imagine that,

325
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,660
 hey, you know what?

326
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,860
 And they'll never ever be held accountable.

327
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,900
 They'll never have to give an account

328
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,620
 for the horrific actions of murdering all those people.

329
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,420
 I mean, it's crazy.

330
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,220
 And in hell, every crime, every sin,

331
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,180
 all of the cries of our world for justice will be settled.

332
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,340
 Either there or every sin is paid for or on the cross.

333
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,540
 Our world cries for justice.

334
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,020
 I mean, you look around all the time,

335
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,800
 people are going, man, when there's injustice,

336
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,180
 something inside of us goes, that is wrong.

337
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,380
 The fact that that person wasn't held accountable

338
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,280
 or that there's no justice over what they did.

339
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,120
 Why do I say that?

340
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,480
 This is a picture of a guy

341
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,480
 that recently has been all over social media or the news

342
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,720
 and just the public conversation.

343
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,840
 And appropriately so, his name's Ahmaud Arbery.

344
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,080
 And a couple months ago,

345
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,440
 he was out, it seems, jogging in a neighborhood

346
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,560
 and two people thought he was up to something

347
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,800
 and they decided to make a citizen's arrest

348
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,600
 and he lost his life because of the exchange,

349
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,920
 the interaction that took place there.

350
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,840
 It's an unbelievable tragedy.

351
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,440
 Every time a life is lost, it's tragic.

352
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,740
 But then afterwards, there was no investigation.

353
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,640
 The two people who shot him were not took to trial

354
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,960
 or they weren't put in a jail cell,

355
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,600
 they weren't held accountable.

356
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,960
 And the demand and our world cried out, this is unjust.

357
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,680
 Because there's something inside of us

358
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,620
 that wants to see justice take place for every action.

359
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:06,960
 And in hell, every single crime or sin will be settled for.

360
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,680
 There's never a person who traffics sex slaves,

361
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,880
 rapists, all of the actions of people will be paid for

362
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,600
 in hell or were paid for on the cross.

363
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,320
 Hell brings about and shows us the justice of God

364
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,120
 in a world of injustice.

365
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,880
 Okay, so that's kind of a framework of hell.

366
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,060
 Who will be in hell?

367
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,160
 Which is as important of a question,

368
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,680
 if hell is true that anyone can ever ask,

369
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,980
 or how can I not be there?

370
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,380
 Hell is filled, second point,

371
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,720
 with people who refuse to worship God.

372
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,960
 Those who make up hell are those who reject God,

373
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,520
 the one true God, the God of the Bible,

374
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,960
 they reject God and they refuse, excuse me,

375
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,320
 they refuse to worship him.

376
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,040
 Romans chapter one says,

377
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,900
 "This is what the wrath of God looks like."

378
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,280
 People that say, "God, I don't want you in my life,

379
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,400
 "I don't wanna worship you as God,

380
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,800
 "I don't want you to be the God of my life."

381
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,200
 And God says, "I'll hand you over

382
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,940
 "to letting you be the God of your life.

383
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,180
 "And you're not gonna like where it leads,

384
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,200
 "but I'll hand you over."

385
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,080
 That's what it says the wrath of God is displayed

386
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,440
 or it looks like in Romans chapter one.

387
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,940
 It says this in Romans chapter one, verse 24,

388
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,720
 after saying, "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven,

389
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,740
 "it leads to God handed them over

390
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,340
 "to the sinful desires of their hearts."

391
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,980
 God saying, "Man, you wanna be your own God,

392
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,920
 "you can be your own God,

393
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,980
 "you're not gonna like where it leads."

394
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,460
 But the person who says, "Hey, I wanna do what I wanna do,

395
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,260
 "I speak my truth, nobody can tell me what to do,

396
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,000
 "there is no God out there who I'm confined by,

397
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,980
 "I'll do whatever I want to do whenever I want,

398
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,040
 "and God, I don't want you in my life."

399
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,680
 God eventually says, "Okay,

400
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,000
 "I'm not gonna force you into heaven,

401
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,840
 "I won't force you in a relationship, and hell is filled

402
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,320
 "with people who reject God."

403
00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:02,320
 It's been said, maybe those in hell

404
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,160
 had the opportunity to even get out,

405
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,040
 they wouldn't wanna get out.

406
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,740
 They don't wanna be in heaven, 'cause that's where God is.

407
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,560
 And if they didn't worship and didn't love God

408
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,440
 and didn't wanna do anything with God in this life,

409
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,880
 why would they want to in the next?

410
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,680
 And just imagine with me, could it be true

411
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,240
 that those who make up hell,

412
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,800
 they're not anxious to get out,

413
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,100
 they still don't wanna worship God.

414
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,600
 Lazarus, never in the story, did you recognize this?

415
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,560
 He never says, "Abraham, hey, let me out of here,

416
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,960
 "please let me out of here."

417
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,240
 The only thing he asks is,

418
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,640
 "Hey, I want Lazarus to be my errand boy

419
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,760
 "and go get water for me."

420
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,840
 He still is so self-centered and self-absorbed,

421
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,960
 all he thinks about is himself.

422
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,660
 So worshiping himself, and expect others

423
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,160
 to perform acts of worship on himself.

424
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,960
 Could it be that Lazarus, or could it be that the rich man,

425
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,760
 or could it be that hell is filled with people?

426
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,040
 Whereas C.S. Lewis said,

427
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,200
 "The door is locked from the inside, they don't want out,

428
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,100
 "they reject God and they will for all of eternity."

429
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:06,920
 C.S. Lewis said this, where I got the quote from,

430
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,360
 "The door being locked on the inside,"

431
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,560
 which you know what that means, right?

432
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,200
 Like when somebody's in their house,

433
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,520
 the door is locked from the inside.

434
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,040
 In other words, people may try to get in

435
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,140
 or try to get those people out,

436
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,740
 but they're the ones locking people out.

437
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,700
 He said, "Hell, the damned, are in one sense,

438
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,740
 "successful rebels to the end," those who will go to hell.

439
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,740
 "That the doors of hell are locked on the inside.

440
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,500
 "They enjoy the forever, forever,

441
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,740
 "the horrible freedom they've demanded.

442
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,300
 "I want to do what I want to do,

443
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,720
 "I don't want any God and I never will."

444
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,340
 They've rejected him and they're self-enslaved.

445
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,560
 In the end, there are only two kinds of people,

446
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,820
 those who say to God, "Thy will be done."

447
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:56,160
 And those who reject God, who he in the end says,

448
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,580
 "Thy will be done, I will not force you to love me,

449
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,840
 "I will not force you in a relationship with me,

450
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,680
 "I will not force myself on you.

451
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,220
 "And I will give you the extent of your freedom

452
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,200
 "you can choose to reject."

453
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,520
 The question I think for all of us is,

454
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,760
 are you right now, on that side of the question,

455
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,840
 are you the person who is saying,

456
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,480
 "God, thy will be done, you're the God of my life,

457
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,780
 "your will be done in my life."

458
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,680
 Are you saying, "God, my will be done,

459
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,420
 "I don't want you in my life,

460
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,880
 "I don't want anything to do with you in my life."

461
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,820
 Because God, to that person, eventually says,

462
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,920
 "Thy will be done, I won't force you,

463
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,960
 "I won't force me into your life

464
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,620
 "and I won't force you into heaven.

465
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,840
 "You can have separation from me,

466
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,780
 "if that's what you want, and rejection of me."

467
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,640
 People often ask me, "Hey, well, what about good people?

468
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,160
 "What about people who live pretty much good lives

469
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,000
 "like Gandhi?"

470
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,100
 Gandhi did a bunch of things.

471
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,800
 You're telling me just 'cause he didn't accept

472
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,380
 Jesus as God and worship the Bible,

473
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,620
 or worship the God of the Bible, that Gandhi's in hell?

474
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,580
 What about good people?

475
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,720
 The Bible, as crazy as it is,

476
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,720
 says there is no such thing as good people.

477
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,220
 There was only one who was good,

478
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,500
 Jesus, in Mark chapter 10, verse 18,

479
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,020
 this is Jesus speaking,

480
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,560
 says, "No one is good except God alone."

481
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,840
 Most of us think, "Well, I feel like I'm,

482
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,640
 "I'm not perfect, but I'm a pretty good person.

483
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,020
 "I'm better than most on average."

484
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,580
 By heaven's definition and heaven's standard,

485
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,180
 it says, "No one is good."

486
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,540
 That if you've ever lied, if you've ever stolen,

487
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,300
 you've ever cheated, you've ever gossiped,

488
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,300
 you've ever spoken harshly

489
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,440
 or with anger in your heart towards someone,

490
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,220
 all of those, the Bible would say,

491
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,180
 makes you someone who is no longer good

492
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,300
 by heaven's definition and heaven's standard.

493
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,580
 This is why like good actions

494
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,820
 and being a good person won't get you in,

495
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,700
 because biblically, no one is good.

496
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:59,900
 Why does God allow people to reject him?

497
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,780
 Like, why would he allow anybody to reject him?

498
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,620
 Like, why would God allow someone

499
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,780
 to not want to have a relationship with him

500
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,980
 or to refuse to worship him?

501
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,040
 Like, why couldn't God just force everybody?

502
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,240
 Yes, he will not force you to love him.

503
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,040
 He will not force you to be in a relationship with him.

504
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,760
 You can't force love anyways.

505
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,480
 Like, here's an example, like,

506
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,320
 ladies, you'll resonate with this.

507
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,440
 If a guy comes up to you and, we use Ramsey over here,

508
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,440
 a guy comes up, he's like, "Hey, Rams, I love you.

509
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,380
 "And I wanna be in a relationship with you.

510
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,740
 "And I want us to date."

511
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,400
 And this was a good guy, you liked him,

512
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,360
 he's a friend of yours.

513
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,700
 And you're like, "Hey, oh man."

514
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,780
 Let's say his name is Barry.

515
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:43,020
 You're like, "Barry, I gotta be honest with you.

516
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,380
 "I've never seen you that way.

517
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,020
 "I really don't have feelings for you.

518
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,360
 "I like you as a friend."

519
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,140
 Or, "You're like a brother to me."

520
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,260
 It's like the death nail, Barry, in your heart

521
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,660
 of that relationship's going nowhere.

522
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,940
 But let's say, you know, he's persistent, he comes back,

523
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,100
 he's like, "Our story's gonna end

524
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,140
 "in like the notebook or something.

525
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,360
 "I'm gonna keep going to her.

526
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,960
 "And I, hey, I love you.

527
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,760
 "I wanna be in a relationship with you."

528
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,560
 And he keeps coming back and he keeps coming back.

529
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,400
 If eventually he comes to you and says,

530
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,000
 "Hey, I love you so much.

531
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,240
 "I'm gonna force you to be in a relationship with me."

532
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,880
 If anything goes through your mind

533
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,120
 and you're an average girl, other than,

534
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,940
 "Hey, this guy's crazy.

535
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,020
 "I'm about to get a restraining order.

536
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,160
 "This thing is done.

537
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,200
 "I don't want this person in my life at all."

538
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,280
 He would be nuts.

539
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,420
 I mean, that type of obsessiveness and forcefulness,

540
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,460
 if he came by gunpoint and says,

541
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,120
 "Hey, I love you so much.

542
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,200
 "I'm going to force you to love me."

543
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,900
 One, you wouldn't love him and it would be terrible.

544
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,280
 God, in the same way, is not gonna force anybody

545
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,440
 to love him and force them to have a relationship with him.

546
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,400
 He loves people more than any of us will ever love people.

547
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,440
 But just like in that scenario,

548
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,400
 with a dating relationship,

549
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,760
 Ramsey would head for the hills and get out of there

550
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,800
 'cause that guy is crazy.

551
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,440
 So God is not some crazy person

552
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,880
 who will force you into a relationship

553
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,960
 and force you into love with him.

554
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,600
 And so those who spend eternity in hell will do so

555
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,760
 because they have rejected God.

556
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,000
 And just like in that scenario,

557
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,360
 if that guy really did love Ramsey,

558
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,960
 he wouldn't force her into that relationship.

559
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,800
 What would he do?

560
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,760
 He would leave her alone.

561
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,600
 Say, "You don't want anything?

562
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,800
 "Or you have rejected me and I do love you.

563
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,300
 "So I'm not gonna force you.

564
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,400
 "I will leave you alone."

565
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,040
 And God, in the end, is saying,

566
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,780
 "Man, I do love, even those who reject me, I love.

567
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,920
 "But I will not force them to love me back.

568
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,360
 "And I will not force them in a relationship.

569
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,760
 "I will leave them alone."

570
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,600
 Even if it means for all of eternity.

571
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,800
 Finally, how does hell show us the love of God?

572
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,200
 As I started saying that hell,

573
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,640
 hell is separation from God.

574
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,940
 Hell is a place where those who reject God will be.

575
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,100
 By the way, rejecting God doesn't always look like

576
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,040
 you saying, "God, I reject."

577
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,940
 It looks like you saying,

578
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,700
 "I deserve to go to heaven because I'm a good person."

579
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,480
 If you say that, you have rejected God.

580
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,520
 And I'm about to explain why,

581
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,440
 because God says, like he told the Pharisees,

582
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,880
 "That's not how heaven works.

583
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,780
 "You don't get in through being a good person.

584
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,680
 "There's no such thing."

585
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,560
 But that type of person would be rejecting God.

586
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,080
 Now, how can hell show us the love of God?

587
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,160
 'Cause that seems incompatible.

588
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,160
 It's like, "Wow, it's like so harsh, that punishment."

589
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,880
 How is that show the love of God?

590
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,480
 Because what Jesus did on the cross

591
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,640
 shows us the length to which God was willing to go

592
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,200
 so that no one would have to go to hell.

593
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,360
 That God doesn't want anyone to go to hell.

594
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,480
 And he's proven it and showed it,

595
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,280
 and is so passionate about no one spending eternity

596
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,040
 apart from him, that he was willing to go

597
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,400
 to the very farthest length possible,

598
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,640
 which is giving the life of his own son on a cross.

599
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,440
 There is no greater payment that he could have given.

600
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,800
 And he goes to such an extent in order to prove,

601
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,200
 "This is how much you are worth to me."

602
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,280
 That Jesus was willing to experience separation from God,

603
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,880
 crucifixion on the cross,

604
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,640
 in order that you and I would not have to experience hell.

605
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,160
 He went through, as it were, hell,

606
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,320
 which is separation from God,

607
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,400
 so you and I wouldn't have to.

608
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,920
 That's how much you are worth to him.

609
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,840
 Hell shows us how valuable you are to God.

610
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,400
 Now, why do I say that?

611
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,360
 You remember like in economics, you guys,

612
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,920
 do you ever take economics?

613
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,040
 Yeah, you did.

614
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,800
 I know you took economics, this guy.

615
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,680
 Hey, in economics, there's like a principle that,

616
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,300
 hey, the value of something is determined

617
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,560
 not by what somebody says arbitrarily it's worth,

618
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,840
 it's determined by the price someone will pay for it.

619
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,680
 So if I say, "Hey, this phone is worth a million dollars,"

620
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,900
 it's not worth a million dollars

621
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,680
 unless someone is willing to pay for it.

622
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,920
 Like the value of a thing

623
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,860
 is determined by the payment it will bring.

624
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,320
 When it comes to you and it comes to me

625
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,760
 and it comes to humanity as a whole,

626
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,440
 how valuable are you to God?

627
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,280
 The question is,

628
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,040
 to what lengths is God willing to go

629
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,720
 in order to pay for you?

630
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,440
 To pay for the penalty and the consequences of your sin?

631
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,800
 And the link is the own life of his son.

632
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,020
 There is no farther distance he could have gone.

633
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,000
 That's how valuable you are to God.

634
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,800
 This past week, it was Mother's Day,

635
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,960
 decided I'm gonna get some flowers.

636
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,060
 I've never gotten the professional flowers.

637
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,680
 And for my wife, who's mom,

638
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,500
 I looked at the price tag

639
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,920
 and the price tag from Costco to like Flowers Direct

640
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,240
 is shockingly different.

641
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,960
 It's like multiples of one another.

642
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,000
 And I was like, "Oh man,

643
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,400
 I don't know if I should do this."

644
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,220
 And then I was like,

645
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,640
 "Well, she did give birth to our children.

646
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,880
 Feels like it's worth it."

647
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,480
 And that's an area, it was worth it to me

648
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,780
 'cause I was willing to pay the price.

649
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,840
 When God looked at you and he looked at our world,

650
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,600
 it was worth it to him.

651
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,120
 And he said, "No matter the price, I'll pay it."

652
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,440
 It's how valuable they are to me.

653
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,840
 Jesus spoke about hell

654
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,240
 more than anyone else in the Bible.

655
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,080
 Listen to me.

656
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,200
 What if every time that he spoke of it,

657
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,400
 it was because he was a loving God wanting to warn you.

658
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,600
 I don't want you to go there.

659
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,480
 Jesus more than anybody else, if you like Jesus,

660
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,320
 he's the guy who brings it up over and over and over.

661
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,760
 Half of his parables are about the subject of hell.

662
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,520
 He brings it over or brings it up

663
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,600
 time and time and time again.

664
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,620
 And what if it's not because he's some brimstone,

665
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,880
 angry God out there with a temper tantrum,

666
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,040
 but he's trying to warn you,

667
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,080
 I don't want you to experience eternity separated from me.

668
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,780
 And every time it's a loving father warning us.

669
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,680
 If I was asked this room,

670
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,640
 "Hey, is it possible for a loving father

671
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,080
 to yell at their kids?"

672
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,040
 What would you say?

673
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,320
 Ramsey, you're thinking about it?

674
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,320
 She's still thinking about Barry, I think.

675
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,240
 (congregation laughing)

676
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,720
 No, if I was to say that most, let's just run to it.

677
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,920
 I think a lot of people would say no,

678
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,120
 but the better question would be like,

679
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,640
 what's the context?

680
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,700
 'Cause there could be a scenario

681
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,640
 where it is totally appropriate to yell at your kids.

682
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,100
 Example, my almost two-year-old daughter,

683
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,420
 the other day, two days ago,

684
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,700
 was running out into the street.

685
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,620
 She was running, headed towards the street.

686
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,460
 And of course, I did what any loving heavenly father did,

687
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,700
 which is I'm yelling and running after her, come back here.

688
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,220
 She can't see the truck that's coming around the edge

689
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,240
 and what's headed towards her or what she's headed towards.

690
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,300
 And so like any loving father, of course,

691
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,420
 I'm yelling out, warning her.

692
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,820
 Every time you see Jesus mention it,

693
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,160
 and he mentions it more than anybody else in the Bible,

694
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,940
 over and over and over again.

695
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,060
 It's because he's loving God,

696
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,600
 who's warning and doesn't want anyone to go there.

697
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,660
 Second Peter chapter three says that God is patient,

698
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,200
 wanting no one to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.

699
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,060
 God loves people, he loves you, he loves everyone

700
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,060
 more than anybody else on the planet does.

701
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,540
 And he wants no one to spend eternity apart from him.

702
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,740
 So of course, we would expect him

703
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,580
 to bring it up over and over.

704
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:49,540
 And on that cross, Jesus endured horrific physical pain,

705
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,380
 but even more so spiritual pain,

706
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,900
 because he was separated from God.

707
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,620
 You may not know this, but it wasn't just being crucified.

708
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,020
 He also, we're told, was forsaken by God,

709
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,660
 as though God almost turned his back.

710
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,300
 The relationship was cut off

711
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,300
 as he was crucified on that cross.

712
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,580
 Jesus on the cross cried out, "My God, my God,

713
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,340
 "why have you forsaken me?"

714
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,460
 But their relationship was cut off.

715
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,820
 To have a relationship cut off is always painful,

716
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,140
 but the degree of the intimacy of that relationship

717
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,980
 is directly related to the degree of pain

718
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,820
 when that relationship is severed.

719
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,660
 What do I mean?

720
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,480
 Let me explain.

721
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,080
 Like if my neighbor's cat dies,

722
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,120
 I'm like, "Oh, that's sad.

723
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,000
 "I didn't really know the cat,

724
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,500
 "and I guess that's kind of a bummer, and there you go."

725
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,180
 If my neighbor dies, it's way more sad,

726
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,260
 because we have a much stronger relationship.

727
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:56,140
 If my wife dies, it's horrifically sad and painful

728
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,100
 in my life.

729
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,260
 The degree of the relationship is directly related

730
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,900
 to the degree of the pain in that loss.

731
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,260
 Jesus experienced a level of pain

732
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,740
 out of that relational cutoff

733
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,780
 deeper than anything anyone has ever imagined,

734
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,860
 'cause he was in perfect, eternal relationship

735
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,960
 with the heavenly Father,

736
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,200
 and then we're told he was made sin for you and me,

737
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,540
 and took the wrath of God for every sinful action

738
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,800
 you and I have made, and was separated from God.

739
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,640
 He went through hell so that you and I wouldn't have to.

740
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,440
 Isaiah chapter 53 says this.

741
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,940
 "Jesus was pierced for our rebellion.

742
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,000
 "He was crushed for our sins.

743
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,440
 "He was beaten so that we could be whole."

744
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,320
 Perfect, innocent God,

745
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,600
 beaten so that you and I could be whole.

746
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,120
 "He was whipped so that we could be healed,

747
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,600
 "and all of us like sheep have strayed away.

748
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,900
 "We left God's paths to follow our own,

749
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:56,720
 "yet the Lord laid on him," Jesus, the sins, "of all of us."

750
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
 God loves you to such an extent,

751
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,200
 this is how it shows the love of God,

752
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,880
 that he's willing to say, "Man, I love you so much.

753
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,480
 "I'll lay even my own life down.

754
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,960
 "I'll take everything wrong about this world,

755
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,540
 "every sinful action that you've ever done,

756
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,820
 "every punishment that you deserve,

757
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,280
 "that every person out there deserves,

758
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,800
 "and I'll take all of it, and the full weight of all of that,"

759
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,300
 the Bible says, "went on Jesus on that cross,

760
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,560
 "where he was crucified."

761
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,300
 For every look at pornography, every premarital sex act,

762
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,400
 every time that you and I gossiped about another person,

763
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,680
 every time that we were rude, selfish, self-seeking,

764
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,760
 everything messed up, candidly, in my heart.

765
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,720
 You may think like pastors, they get it all together.

766
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,880
 I'm not a good person.

767
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,640
 I honestly, I think I'm better than most people,

768
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,020
 which even reflects that I'm not a good person.

769
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,400
 Like there's parts of my heart,

770
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,240
 I lust after women who are not my wife.

771
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,280
 I have thoughts about how other people

772
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,520
 don't do enough for me.

773
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,200
 I'm selfish, I get angry.

774
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,740
 I have things in my life that I wish weren't there.

775
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,760
 And I don't deserve to have a relationship with God.

776
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,600
 And despite all of that, on that cross,

777
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,640
 everything wrong I've ever done in the past, in the future,

778
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,700
 all of it was paid for by Jesus.

779
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,360
 Because that is how great the love of God is.

780
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,280
 He didn't want anyone to spend eternity in hell.

781
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,480
 And he doesn't want you to spend eternity in hell.

782
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,980
 But the way you can avoid that is by accepting,

783
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:15,080
 not rejecting God's gift in your life,

784
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,120
 of dying in the cross, dying in your place,

785
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,420
 dying for your sins.

786
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,920
 Do you guys know what the name Lazarus means?

787
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,280
 This is why Jesus is such a fantastic storyteller.

788
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,780
 He's just so brilliant.

789
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,120
 You guys know?

790
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,020
 It means the one God helps.

791
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,280
 You can go look it up, you can Google it,

792
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,500
 it's in like some pastor trick, go look it up.

793
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,940
 The name is the one God helps.

794
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,780
 Think about that.

795
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,560
 How brilliant is it?

796
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,360
 Who's gonna spend eternity with God?

797
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,640
 The one God helps.

798
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,900
 You can't get there on your own.

799
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,160
 You'll never get there on your own.

800
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,960
 Your good actions won't enable you

801
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,580
 to deserve a relationship.

802
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,280
 The bad things you've done don't keep you out

803
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,140
 of having a relationship with God.

804
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,420
 It is you accepting the help of God

805
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,620
 that if I'm gonna have a relationship with you

806
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,480
 for all of eternity, it's gonna be contingent on you,

807
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,000
 on what you did in my place,

808
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,380
 on the fact that you paid for everything wrong in my life,

809
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,260
 everything wrong I've ever done.

810
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,760
 And you said, if I just trust in you

811
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,140
 that whosoever believes, John 3:16 says,

812
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,480
 "Not whosoever behaves shall have eternal life."

813
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,940
 It's whosoever believes shall not perish,

814
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,240
 but have eternal life.

815
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,200
 And that invitation and that offer is extended to you

816
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,820
 in all of humanity, but you will not ever get there

817
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,340
 if you just assume, hey, I can get there,

818
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,820
 I deserve to be there on my own.

819
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,260
 You are not the one God helps.

820
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,440
 Only those who receive the help

821
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,400
 and the free gift of God in Christ

822
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,600
 will spend eternity with God.

823
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,680
 If you've never had a moment in your life

824
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,120
 where you trusted in that gift, tonight is your night.

825
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,280
 You're not saved by saying magic words of a prayer.

826
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,000
 A prayer is only something where you go to God

827
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,760
 and people will be like, did you pray the prayer?

828
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,160
 A magic prayer or saying doesn't save you.

829
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,540
 The prayer just reflects a belief

830
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,640
 and a posture of your heart that goes,

831
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,120
 man, I think I'm a sinner.

832
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,260
 I think I'm messed up.

833
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,620
 I'm not a good person, God.

834
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,820
 But I believe that you gave your life on the cross.

835
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,820
 You died for me, despite the fact that I didn't deserve it.

836
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:18,560
 And I trust not in how many times I go to the church

837
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,000
 or go to church or read my Bible or good things that I do,

838
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,280
 but only in what you did.

839
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,880
 You're the only reason why I could have eternal life.

840
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,880
 I'm trusting only in that, God.

841
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,380
 And I believe that because of what you did for me,

842
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,520
 I stand with you and I don't have to worry

843
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,960
 about where I'm gonna spend eternity

844
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,200
 'cause it'll be with you.

845
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,080
 In your own way, acknowledging I'm a sinner,

846
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,820
 God, you loved me so much, you died for me.

847
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,440
 And I believe that what you did,

848
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,440
 dying in my place and rising again from the grave

849
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,900
 has given me forgiveness of sins.

850
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,280
 It's not good people in heaven and bad in hell.

851
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,320
 It's forgiven people in heaven and everybody else in hell.

852
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,480
 And that invitation is offered to you tonight,

853
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,520
 wherever you are in the quiet of your room,

854
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,360
 maybe you're with other people,

855
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,480
 you just need to step outside and go, do I believe this?

856
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,660
 Do I believe this?

857
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,760
 And in doing so, if you decide to receive that free gift

858
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,000
 forever, you don't have to wonder where you stand with God.

859
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,800
 You don't have to wonder where you go when you die.

860
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,880
 And if you haven't, you don't have to wonder

861
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,000
 candidly either, because you're gonna spend eternity

862
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,840
 apart from God, 'cause you're rejecting God's help,

863
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,980
 God is savior.

864
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,200
 And the reason why Jesus came,

865
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,360
 in conclusion, hell is a place where the justice of God

866
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,900
 is revealed.

867
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,900
 Those who reject the free gift of God and reject God

868
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,300
 will be there.

869
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:47,300
 And hell displays how loving, how much God loves you and me

870
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,280
 and what he was willing to do,

871
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,080
 the lengths he was willing to go to.

872
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,740
 Let me close by saying this.

873
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:58,520
 There was a guy, give a quick history example

874
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,480
 that kind of illustrates what Christianity teaches.

875
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,520
 His name was George Wilson.

876
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,520
 He was a guy in the late 1820s, around 1829 in Pennsylvania.

877
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,480
 He robbed a mail carrier.

878
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,600
 So he decided to go up, a federal mail carrier,

879
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,680
 he robbed him, he ended up killing the mail carrier.

880
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,680
 He was captured and he was put on trial.

881
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,240
 He was convicted and he was found guilty of a federal crime

882
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,080
 and he was sentenced to death by execution,

883
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,720
 to hanging by execution.

884
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,120
 And he's sitting in jail and it's George Wilson.

885
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,560
 And some of his friends, he was well-connected.

886
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,040
 He had people in high places.

887
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,720
 They went to the president of the United States.

888
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,680
 It's a true story, you can look it all up.

889
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,040
 And they said, "Hey, George Wilson is in jail.

890
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,920
 "Can you issue him a presidential pardon?"

891
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,160
 Presidential pardon is the only way

892
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,360
 if there's a federal crime

893
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,560
 that you're getting out of that sentence

894
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,320
 without paying for your crime.

895
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,600
 So they go to him and for whatever reason,

896
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,640
 Andrew Jackson decides,

897
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,640
 "I'm going to extend a presidential pardon to George Wilson

898
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,560
 "so that he wouldn't have to die."

899
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,960
 George is told and he's brought to court

900
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,320
 and they say, "The president has extended this pardon to you."

901
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,960
 And George says, "I don't want his pardon."

902
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,360
 We're not really told why.

903
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,500
 It's kind of a mystery.

904
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,560
 Some people think it's because

905
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,680
 he didn't want to acknowledge guilt

906
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,520
 or acknowledge that I was guilty of that crime,

907
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,520
 or he just wanted to kind of like stick it to the man

908
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,040
 and I don't care about any of you guys,

909
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,040
 but he didn't accept, or he says, "I don't accept it.

910
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,160
 "I don't even care."

911
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,160
 And this forced a question in the court where they go,

912
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,700
 "What do you do if there's a presidential pardon

913
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,240
 "that's issued?

914
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,400
 "Can someone reject a presidential pardon?"

915
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,440
 And it led to another court,

916
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,400
 like they ran it up the courts.

917
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,020
 And eventually it went to the United States Supreme Court.

918
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,560
 There's United States versus Wilson.

919
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,080
 It's a classic court case.

920
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,040
 If you went to law school, you may have been familiar with it.

921
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,240
 And here's what the Supreme Court ruled.

922
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,120
 This is Chief Justice John Marshall.

923
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,120
 "A pardon is an act of grace

924
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,960
 "proceeding from the power entrusted

925
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,320
 "with the execution of the law."

926
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,680
 So basically it's an act of grace from the president.

927
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,400
 "But its delivery is not completed

928
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,140
 "without acceptance of that pardon.

929
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,480
 "It may be rejected by the person to whom it is given,

930
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,200
 "and we have no power in a court to force it on them."

931
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,560
 Here's the Supreme Court ruled.

932
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,580
 "A president cannot force someone

933
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,160
 "to accept a presidential pardon."

934
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,400
 So George Wilson can choose to reject it.

935
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,880
 And a pardon, if it is not accepted, it is not applied.

936
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,120
 George Wilson was executed by hanging

937
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,760
 because he decided, "I reject that pardon."

938
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,160
 The Bible teaches something very similar.

939
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,640
 God has extended a presidential,

940
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,420
 a divine pardon to all people everywhere.

941
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,840
 If they're willing to accept the free gift

942
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,160
 that Jesus died in their place.

943
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,840
 In many ways, it's a far greater pardon than that one.

944
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,600
 'Cause the president in that scenario

945
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,720
 just writes up a pardon and says,

946
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,540
 "Hey, you're off the hook."

947
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,360
 In the Christian scenario, or what happened scenario,

948
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,280
 is that God said, "Hey, somebody has to pay for this sin.

949
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,740
 "And I'm not gonna force it on you.

950
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,160
 "I'm willing to extend a pardon to you

951
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,400
 "because I'm going to crush my son on a cross

952
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,940
 "and pay for all of the sins of humanity

953
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,720
 "and all of the sins of the world around us."

954
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,040
 And in that, he extended to every person a divine pardon.

955
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,440
 And the choice is yours.

956
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,420
 Are you going to accept it?

957
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,280
 Because if you do not, it will not be applied.

958
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,880
 But it's not because it's not extended by God.

959
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,340
 Just like it was by the president.

960
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,760
 It was extended.

961
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,600
 Just wasn't accepted.

962
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,600
 Every person listening right now

963
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,520
 and just in the world in general

964
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,480
 has been extended a divine pardon by God,

965
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,660
 saying, "I'm paying for it.

966
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,180
 "I've paid for it.

967
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,640
 "But you have to accept it or it will not be applied."

968
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,520
 He's a loving God.

969
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,840
 He doesn't want anyone to go to hell.

970
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,120
 And he was willing to go to such great lengths

971
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,800
 to go through hell in and of itself, if it were,

972
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,160
 so that you and I wouldn't have to.

973
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,980
 Let me pray.

974
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,560
 (gentle music)

975
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,100
 Father, thank you that,

976
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:58,860
 thank you, seems like silly, honestly,

977
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:02,100
 that you would endure

978
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:07,700
 eternal death in our place

979
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:12,220
 and suffering at a level that none of us will ever know

980
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:17,620
 so that all of us could spend eternity with you.

981
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,900
 (gentle music)

982
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,220
 Father, I pray for anyone listening right now

983
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,940
 who's never trusted in what Jesus did on the cross.

984
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,980
 They still think they're good actions or they're bad actions

985
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,980
 or the way they can have a relationship with you,

986
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,500
 that you would pierce through that fog

987
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,020
 and let them see it as a lie.

988
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,540
 That is a lie from hell.

989
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,820
 That good people go to heaven, bad people go to hell.

990
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,440
 It is only forgiven people.

991
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,860
 And the only way to get that forgiveness

992
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,660
 is by receiving the free gift of what you did on the cross.

993
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,100
 We're unworthy, God, and yet you love us,

994
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,960
 gave your life for us, you paid it all for us.

995
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,140
 Would you allow people tonight,

996
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,700
 for the very first time, to trust in that?

997
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,660
 And would you allow those of us who have

998
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,300
 to walk in light of that, to share our faith

999
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,000
 in light of the fact that everyone around us

1000
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,500
 will spend eternity somewhere?

1001
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,740
 And it doesn't have to be apart from you.

1002
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,020
 Father, we love you.

1003
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,420
 We praise you, that you paid it all.

1004
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,420
 We worship you in song, amen.

1005
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:30,420
