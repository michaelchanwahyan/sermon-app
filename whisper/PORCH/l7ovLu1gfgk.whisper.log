[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (Music)
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Hey, it's good to be with you guys. My name is JP, Jonathan Picluda.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And I'm just traveling through this series.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   And like one thing about me is, man, I love gifts.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   That's not a hint. Don't buy me or anything.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   But that's my love language is gifts.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   And so I like to buy gifts.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   We tend to, you know, express to others our love language.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   And so one thing I love like Christmas time, you know, or birthdays.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   And anytime there's a chance to get or receive, give or receive gifts.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   And so at Christmas time we had our young adult Christmas party.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   That's our staff Christmas party at my house.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   And so what I did is I wanted to do a gift exchange.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   And so I just went and got gifts for everyone there.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   And then we did that deal where you draw numbers.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   You know, there's a lot of things to call it.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   I'll call it politically correct, rob your neighbor or something.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And so everybody gets a number.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   You guys know the rules.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Like one gets to go again at the end.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   So one goes first, then two, then three.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   And you can steal.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   And with three steals, then the gift is locked after three steals.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   You guys know the game?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Okay, good.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And so we play.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And so, you know, as you're sitting there, you probably played the game.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   You're sitting there and you're kind of looking at your gift.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And you're like, hey, am I going to use this gift or do I hope to lose this gift?
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   And what happens is people start selling their gift.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   They're like, hey, Kelly, man, I don't know if you noticed, man, this thing is a juicer.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Look, it's really neat, you know.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And, hey, you know, you mentioned you need a juicer.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   So they can go and have one more shot, you know.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Or they go, oh, no, no.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And they start hiding it behind them.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Like, no, you don't want it.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   It doesn't look very cool, you know.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   And they're trying to keep the gift.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   So some of them want to keep the gift.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Some of them want to lose the gift.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And they're thinking, hey, will I use the gift?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   But I played my game with a twist, okay, because that's what's fun.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   So here's what we did is I had a special gift in there that had a consequence tied to it.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And what it was was it was this Christmas inflatable yard art, okay.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And if you got it, you had to keep it up through January all the way to February every day, okay.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   That's what you had to do.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And so I told them that.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I said, hey, here's the deal.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   There's one gift in here that you may not want.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And if you get it, you can't get rid of it.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   So if you open that gift, right, now I'm telling you what it is.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   If you open that gift, you're stuck with it.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   And so everybody's kind of nervous because nobody wants to keep the Christmas yard art.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Oh, and by the way, it wasn't just Christmas art.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   In fact, let me show you the incredible yard art that it was.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I think we'll show you.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Neat how that works, right.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And so it was just to give you a little flavor.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Like some of you are like, oh, no, that's cool.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It's a nutcracker.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   No, it's not.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   It's a redneck nutcracker, okay.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Got a nice little beer belly here, all right.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Got a snowflake tattoo over here.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Missing some teeth.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Got the redneck mustache.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And can't forget the can of beer to celebrate Christmas, okay.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   So if you get the redneck nutcracker, you've got to keep it up all the way until February.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And nobody wanted to get that gift, right.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And so I see them kind of nervous.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Like, man, I don't want to get that one.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Low and behold, my dear friend Laura Elmore, who served on our staff at the time, she gets that gift.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   She unwraps it.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Oh, to her demise.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Her husband is also there, John Elmore, which I think is ironic because he heads up our recovery ministry and was an alcoholic, you know.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And so he's got the redneck nutcracker with the beer in front of his house all the way to February.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And he's like, okay, man, I don't know if I can do this.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   And then he's like, yeah, sure, I'll do it because he's a gamer.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And so I tell you that because tonight as we move through quarter life crisis, we're going to talk about something that the scripture calls a gift.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   But I think so many of us hope to lose the gift instead of use the gift.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And that gift is, ready, singleness.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Scriptures, the Bible, God, the creator of the heavens and the earth through his servant Paul called singleness a gift.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   He called being single a gift.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And I don't know that we fully take advantage of that gift that the creator God has entrusted to us for at least a season because we're constantly living in some future season.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And I think we really miss out on all that that gift has to offer.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And so I don't know if you're here and your mom is constantly asking you things like you don't want to be married, you know.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And you're like, hey, mom, some of you are nodding your head.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   You're like, mom, it's not up to me, you know.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Or maybe you're starting to think, maybe that whole 30, that's a good idea, you know, maybe CrossFit, maybe that's my problem.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Maybe I need to do CrossFit and I'll meet someone special.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Or you're thinking, man, I'd be married if I had more money or you're wondering, when will I ever find the one?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   There it goes. He's going down.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   There we go.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   You're thinking, maybe I'd be married or when will I ever find the one?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   When will this happen, God?
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Or maybe you're here and you're like, man, how do I let him know I'm interested?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And you spend a lot of your time wondering, how do I let him know I'm interested?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Or maybe you see it as a gift.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Maybe you're like, dude, I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Singleness is a gift. It's awesome.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And you're abusing the gift.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   You're thinking, hey, man, I'll take this gift that God gave me for a season and I'll use it for me.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   That's right, I'll use it for me and it's going to be fun and I'm going to jack with people's hearts.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And I'm going to drag people along.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And I'm going to play the physical game and I'm going to experience as much pleasure as I possibly can outside the context of what God intended because I don't fear God.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   So how can we use this gift that the Lord has entrusted to us for a season?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   As we move through this text, we're going to be in First Corinthians, Chapter seven.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   We're going to talk about seeing singleness as a gift.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   We're going to talk about the reason you're single, which was the title to the emailer.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   And so if you follow us on Twitter or you have signed up for the emailer, you may have gotten that.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And some of you I've heard that that rubbed you the wrong way.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   It says we're going to tell you the reason you're single.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Oh, we are indeed not just we, but the scripture actually.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   And so stay tuned for that.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   As we move through the scripture, we're going to talk about lastly, a season of singleness for some of you.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   What does that look like?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   We're going to be in First Corinthians seven.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   This is Paul's letter to the church in Corinth, which was an incredibly messed up place.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   But we can draw hope from that because Paul in his letter, he actually addresses them as saints or if you have the new NIV, a holy people.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   And so these this this place where these terrible things are happening.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   OK, there's a dude who's sleeping with his father's wife.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   There's men who are going out with prostitutes.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   There's people who are getting drunk at communion.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   OK, they're seeking the party, even in church.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And Paul says, hey, you're a holy people.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And as he addresses this, this holy people, almost 2000 years ago, he addresses this topic of singleness.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   And he has some really specific commands for them that I believe we can apply to our lives today.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I'm going to start in verse six and then later on a jump to verse 32.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   OK, so that's where we'll be in First Corinthians seven.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   I hope you're encouraged.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   He says this. I say this as a concession, not as a command.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And so as I read that, I'm tempted to think it refers to the verses before.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   But but read it like this as a concession, not as a command.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I say this. I wish that all of you were as I am.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   This is Paul who is single saying, hey, it is my desire that you were as I am.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   It's not necessarily God's desire, but it is my selfish desire.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   I say this as a concession, not as a command.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   But each of you porch has your own gift from God.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   One has this gift. Another has that.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Now we see this idea that that our status.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Whether married or single is a gift from God.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Now to the unmarried and the widows, I say it is good for them to stay unmarried as I do.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Paul writes. God preserved the scripture.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   For centuries that we might read it today and learn from it here at the porch is one reason.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   And so the first point that I bring before you is challenging you to see your singleness as a gift.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   My first point is seeing your singleness as a gift.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   And so this is not the gift that we want to use. This is the gift.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   This is the gift so often that we want to lose.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   We hope that God would send us to another life stage.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   And so it's really interesting because I see this all the time as I meet with a lot of you.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   And I have experienced it myself as I was single in Dallas.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   It's like if we're single and we're not being asked out, we just hope to be dating.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   And if we're dating, then we hope to be married.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And so often I meet with people who are married who just hope to be single again.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And it's very cyclical.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   It's like basically we just can't be content in the life stage that we're in.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   We're constantly longing for another life stage.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And some of you are like, "No, I'm dating and I just hope to stay dating."
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Some of you are nudging your boyfriend right now. He's talking about you.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   [Laughter]
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And that's not right either because as we've talked here many times, dating exists for the sole purpose of marriage.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Dating is actually an extra-biblical idea. You can't find it anywhere in the Scriptures.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   There's really only two seasons. There's single and then there's married.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Or betrothed, I should say.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   And that's the closest we get to dating is being actually engaged.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   But we've kind of introduced this idea of dating and then a whole other flavor of seriously dating.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And all that it actually does is slow down this process that God has intended to actually be married.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   And so you see our generation continuing to delay that season of marriage longer and longer and longer.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Because what we like to do, we like to play married.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And that's dating.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   We like to pretend to be married and we call that dating.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   "Hey, you're cute. I enjoy spending time with you.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Hey, you want to pretend to be married for a couple months, maybe about a year and a half or something?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   We just play house?"
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Let me talk to you for a second about the presence that my children get.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   I've got three kids. Weston, 20 months. He's 20 months old.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And then Presley's seven. Finley's five.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   And I watch the gifts that they give and I find it ironic.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   The gifts that they get, rather. I find it ironic.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Because what they get is these gifts that are all replicas of a future season in life.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Let me explain.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Like Weston, he gets a toy lawnmower.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   What we do is, he's a kid, right?
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And so even with our kids, we kind of push them into living into some future life stage.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   "Hey, why don't you pretend to be an adult?" Weston at 20 months. And mow the grass.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   And so then my girls, Presley and Finley, they get a kitchen.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   So they can play house.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   And so it's like, "Okay, you guys pretend to be house."
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   And Presley's like, "Okay, I'm the mommy. You're the daddy."
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   I'm like, "That's weird. Stop that."
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   And so then what they'll do is they'll get these baby dolls.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   And they're obsessed with baby dolls. My daughters.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   And sometimes my son. I'm sad to say.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   But my daughters, they're obsessed with baby dolls.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   And so one day when Finley was three, she's walking around.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   She has this baby doll stuffed up her shirt.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I'm like, "What are you doing?" She's like, "I'm breastfeeding."
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   I'm like, "Don't ever say that word again!"
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   "What? Where did you hear that?"
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   "You better lose that term."
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   It's like, "Girl, no. Be three."
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   "No, you're not. No! No! Stop!"
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   But we're always... And you know what? It's cute when you're three.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   It's not so cute when you're 33.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   It's cute when you're three when you play house.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   And you're constantly trying to live in a season that you're not in.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   But when you're 33, it's less cute.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   When you're playing house.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   And you're constantly living in a season that you're not in.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   And so Paul is saying singleness is a gift.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   I want you to know marriage is a gift too. It absolutely is.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Marriage is a good thing. Proverbs 18.22 says,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   "He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord."
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   But I think we read that and we miss the context.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   We read that and we think, "And he who does not find a wife finds wrath from the Lord."
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   And it doesn't say that. It doesn't say you're not the favorless.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   It's not like God has forgotten you or forsaken you.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Because the scripture also actually says that singleness is good.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Marriage is good and singleness is good.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   It says that they're both good.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   So if we read it in context, now we can go to verse 28.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   1 Corinthians 7.28 it says, "But if you marry, you have not sinned." Paul writes.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   "And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned."
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   "But those who marry now will face many troubles in this life."
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   "And I want you, and I want to spare you this."
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Literally, troubles in this life translates tribulations in the flesh.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   "But those who marry will face many troubles in this life."
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   And Paul, the apostle Paul, he's looking you in the face and he's saying,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   "I just want to spare you of this."
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Or at least, as he goes on, to say, "Prepare you for this."
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   "Make sure you know what's coming, that you're going into this eyes wide open."
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   And so it's interesting because we tend to elevate marriage so much in the church.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   But is it not ironic that the apostle Paul, the greatest missionary to ever live, was single?
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   He was single.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   And he said, "It's great. It's good. I wish you were as I am."
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   You know who else was single?
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Jesus was single.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Is Jesus not the most eligible bachelor on the planet?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   I know some of you are like, "Can I laugh at that? Or is that blasphemous?"
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Just track with me.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Women like, I've heard, men who have power and whatnot,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   He's God, alright?
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   So He can do anything. He spoke things into existence.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   It seems like He's a pretty eligible bachelor.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   And He was 33 years old, so He moved past that time when folks in this culture would have gotten married.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   But He chose not to take a wife because He was on a mission.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   And He didn't have that distraction of marriage.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   He is our example.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   And so marriage is a good thing, but not at the expense of singleness being a good thing.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Singleness is also a really, really good thing.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   And so, so much, I think, of our quarter life crisis is us trying to live in some different season
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   instead of living in the season that God has entrusted to us.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   And so those of you here that are playing married,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   I have a word of caution for you.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Not I, but the Lord.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Be careful.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   The Bible really gives you two options in dealing with lust.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Option one is to make war with it.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   To remove that which is causing you temptation.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   To cut off the hand and gouge out the eye, which seem like pretty extreme things to me.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   But those come from Jesus Himself.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   That you would wage war with lust for the sake of pursuing a greater good in God.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   The other option is marriage.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   For Paul writes, "It's better to marry than to burn."
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Now it's interesting to me that he doesn't write, "Hey, listen, if you're burning with passion, just go ahead and look at some porn."
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   "Hey, listen, if you're burning with passion, go ahead and masturbate."
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   "Okay, take care of that. Take matters into your own hands. Get rid of that passion. It's all good."
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   But he doesn't do that. He gives you two options.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   He says, "Hey, you can wage war with your lust or you can get married."
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   And what do we do? We play house and put off marriage and continue to play with our lust.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   And continue to experience the pleasures that were never intended to happen outside of marriage.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Why? Because we don't trust God who says, "Hey, I'm not trying to rip you off. I'm trying to set you free. I'm trying to give you life."
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   "Do you not look at statistics? Do you not see the direction you're headed? I have something for you that's better."
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   And we say, "God, we don't trust you."
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Like if we're just real honest, "God, we just don't trust you. We'd like to do it our way."
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Verse 9, "But if they cannot control themselves, they shouldn't marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion."
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   This burning with passion or giving in to the fire of passion will add to your quarter-life crisis.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Much anxieties. Much anxieties.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   But God says, "No, you have two options. You can use the gift of singleness that I've entrusted to you."
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Or you can move to another season.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   And moving to another season may not be up to you.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   So if you find yourself single, then your option, your only option that honors God is to use it.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   My brother-in-law, this Christmas this past year, we go to my wife's family's Christmas exchange,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   which they're notorious for giving awful gifts.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   I'm just being honest.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   And my brother, not my in-laws, they give great gifts, but their extended family gives awful gifts.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   And my brother-in-law's uncle, he gives him this little package, he opens it, and it's a stopwatch.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Which is a bad enough gift as it is, because what do you use a stopwatch for?
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   We have an iPhone, it's got a stopwatch.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   But it doesn't work. It's a broken stopwatch.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   And so my brother-in-law is just like, "Okay, this just kind of adds to the awful gifts."
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   And everybody's like, "What do I want to do with this stopwatch?"
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   And I kind of heard his uncle say that it was valuable, and it was plastic, so it didn't look valuable,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   but I heard him say it was valuable.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   And so my brother-in-law, I was like, "Hey, maybe it's worth something."
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   He's like, "You want it?"
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   And I was like, "Sure, I'll take it."
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   But why?
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Because I know that his uncle desires to give him good gifts, right?
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   His uncle loves him, he cares for him.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   If you give him a stopwatch and it doesn't work, it's got to be for a reason.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   So he gives it to me.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   I look on eBay.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   It's going for about $150.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   So I sold it.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   It was worth something.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   He didn't know it.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   He was taking it for granted.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   It was useful, and he didn't realize it.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   And there's a risk whenever you have something that's really useful and you don't understand how to use it.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Singleness is a gift, and it's useful.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   And the way that you use the gift is you trust the giver.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   See, I was like, "Hey, man, I trust your uncle would give you something good.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   He would desire to give you something good.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   I trust this thing has a value.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   For some reason, he gave it to you."
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   And in the same way, as you find yourself single, you can trust the one who gave that gift to you and ask him how you might use it.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Verse 32, "I would like you to be free from concern."
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   The word "concern" is literally "anxieties."
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Paul writes, "I would like you to be free from anxieties.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs, how he can please the Lord.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world, how he can please his wife.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   And his interests are divided.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world, how she can please her husband.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord."
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   And so Paul, in this small paragraph, gives us two profound, important lessons.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   One, he is trying to convince you something that you will not believe, but I'm going to say anyways, because it's my duty as I exegete the scripture.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   Marriage will not solve your problems.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Marriage is only going to add to your problems.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   There are problems in singleness.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   There are more problems in marriage.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   And if you don't like that truth, you're like, "What did he just say?"
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   It's straight from the scripture.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   That's what Paul is saying.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Okay?
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   It's a good thing, but you're choosing your problems.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   And with marriage, you're choosing more problems.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   I'm not trying to talk you out of it.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   I'm just trying to teach accurately what the scripture says.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   And the second one.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   So first one is marriage actually puts a magnifying glass on your problems.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And the second one is actually my second point this evening.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   And it's this, that you are single for a reason.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Paul is going to show you now the reason that you have found yourself single for at least a season.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   He says, "No, there is a reason you are single."
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   And so if I could go back personally to being single, and not that I fantasize about this at all,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   but as I think about it and spend time with you, I'm telling you, there are things I would do dramatically different.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   I would take an international trip at least once a year to go and to take the gospel to the dark places of this earth.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   I might use all my vacation days doing exactly that.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   I would see my place of business as a mission field.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   I would lose my job sharing the gospel, or at least I'd want to.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   I would want to be there and understand that God has hung a light exactly where he has, and that I would be there for a purpose.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   I would belong to a church. I would become a member there. I would serve there. I would give there.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   And I would come under the authority of the elders there, and I would say,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   "Would you guys help me find what gifts the Lord has entrusted to me so that I can unleash those gifts for the kingdom?"
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   I would not think of Christianity as this idea that I would add to my life,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   but I would think about it as the biggest thing about my life,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   processing all decisions in regards to how they would bring glory to God, the creator, the maker of heaven and of earth.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   I would ask him constantly, "Lord, how do you want to use my life to bring your kingdom here to this place?
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   What do you want to do through me? I believe you want to do incredible things today.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   For the eyes of the Lord go to and fro, looking for hearts that are fully his.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Lord, I pray that you would find me so faithful that you might use me to change this place."
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   If I was single, again, I would get trained.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   I would become biblically equipped, biblically literate.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   I would learn the scriptures. There's classes here that are free, or very close to free,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   and they're equivalent of seminary classes.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   You can go and sit under the teachings of great Bible teachers so that you know this book through and through
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   and how to apply it to your life so that you can go into any situation to bring about the resolve that God desires through his scriptures.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   You can do that now, for you will never have more time.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   It's so frustrating when married people say that, and it's so true.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   It can frustrate you, but your frustration does not change, make it any less true.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   I love you, and I'm telling you, I'm pleading with you, you will never have more time for the rest of your life than you do right now.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   And so he just says, "Focus."
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   It seems like what he's saying in this small text is like, "Selfish singleness is not an option. It's your ministry."
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Like, you cannot be selfishly single. There's some of you here that are like, "No, I like to be single. I don't want to be married. I want to play the field."
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   That's not an option. That's not an option.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   That's what the world does, so if you want to do like the pagans do, that's what you can do.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   But if you're here and you're like, "Hey, I claim Christ," you don't have the option of playing the field and keeping my options open
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   and, "Hey, I'm going to kiss her tonight and her tomorrow and take her out and jack with her heart."
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   That's not an option for you. "Hey, I'm going to have some friends with benefits."
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   No, there are no friends with benefits in the kingdom.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   There's no friends with benefits in the kingdom.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Okay, that's not how we do, man.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   That's what the pagans do, man.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   You're submitted to a greater spirit than the spirit that is in the world.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   You say, "Hey, I will pursue a spouse or I will live radically for the kingdom of God."
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Those are your two options. You choose.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   If you know Christ and you're here, and I know a lot of you don't, but if you're here and you know Christ, you choose between those two options.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Those are your two options.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Todd walks into my office, my first year on staff.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Todd's the senior pastor here. And he says, "Hey, JP."
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   "Yes, sir." "How's your ministry doing? How's your ministry going?"
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   I instantly had this response. I'm like, "Hey, man, let me tell you about it, Todd."
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   It's great. Young adults are getting into community groups and watching lives change.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   This dude trusted Christ. This girl trusted Christ.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   This girl came from this background and changed everything about her life.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   God did that in her. It's incredible to think we're going to Haiti, Todd.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   We're going to Brazil. We're going to Africa. It's amazing, these trips.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   He looked at me confused and he said, "No, bro. How's your ministry going?"
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   He points to a picture of my family.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   He says, "Dude, that's your ministry. That's your primary ministry. This ministry comes first."
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   I'm here with you guys, and it is a joy and an honor to be with you.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   But the truth of the matter is my wife's at home. She's tucking our three kids into bed.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   She's singing "Jesus Loves Me." She's reading them Bible stories.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   She's changing that diaper for you. She's giving him the bottle.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   I'm here, and I'll get home long after they're tucked in.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   I'm grateful she's there, but that's my primary ministry. This is my secondary ministry.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   If I don't do that well, I'll never do this well.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   I am a man with a divided heart. That's the truth.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   That's what Paul is saying.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   I am less available to you than I could be, and I'm grateful.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   But that's the truth, and that's what he's saying.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   I just ask you, can relationships distract you from God?
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Everyone needs to be nodding their head, north and south.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   There are two kinds of people here.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   There are folks that came in, they're singing, "You will love me."
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   They're singing, and they're worshiping God, and they're here, and they're focused on God.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   I'm like 1 Corinthians 7, and they're like, "Oh, great, man. Paul's letter to the church at Corinth."
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   They're taking notes, and I know where he's going, singleness.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   This is going to be awesome. They're hanging on to every word and the illustrations.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   They're like the Nutcracker. "Ha, ha. I love it. I'm learning. I'm teaching."
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   And then there's others of you that are like, "Oh, man, she's right there.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Oh, man, he's behind me."
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   And you haven't heard a word I've said. You don't even know I'm up here right now.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   You're the ones not laughing right now, because you're in this daze of, "Okay, she wore the dress.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Oh, my goodness. Should be illegal."
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   "Okay, I didn't get to shake her hand or meet and greet, but maybe afterwards I can go up and say something."
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   "Lord, give me the courage to say something."
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   That's the other half of you. Like you don't even know you're in church right now.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Okay? You're still figuring this thing out.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Relationships can indeed be a distraction.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   I'm telling you, I've had to back out of the last two international trips that I was on.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Not for any emergency, like for a dance recital and something else. I don't remember what it was.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Something family-related. I was like, "Hey, it doesn't make sense for me to go on this trip."
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   And I had to ask for my commitment back.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   But I sat down with my single friend the other day. I hadn't seen her in a while.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   She actually helps me prepare these messages. Week in and week out, we sit together and talk about what the Scripture is saying.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   I'm with a group of people. My friend Cheryl, she's 40 years old and she's single.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   And we sit down and I just said, "Hey, Cheryl, I haven't seen you in a while."
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   And she goes, "I know, man. Seven weeks, six different places, six different airports, three different countries."
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   "I've been traveling."
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   I'm like, "Oh, tell me about it."
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   And she always has these magnificent stories of God working.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   And she's doing the things that some of you only dream about doing. Why?
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Because she's using her singleness.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   And you know what? Some of you...
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Okay, this is the crazy part.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Some of you would feel sorry for her.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   And I think, "What a joke."
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Because she would never say this because she's humble.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   But I'll tell you, she should feel sorry for you.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Because you're wasting your singleness.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   She's using her singleness.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   You hope you lose your singleness.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   And she's using every day of her singleness to bring the kingdom here.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   When I get up there, I hope I get her house.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Or one like it.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Right?
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   God's using her in that way.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   And you can be used in that way as well.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   She's not distracted by a husband or desperation for one.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   She says, "Hey, if God gives me that, great."
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   "But until then, I'm single."
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   "So I'll use it."
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   "If the Lord entrusts me with one, awesome."
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   "But until then, I'll leverage the gifts that He gave me."
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   So why is she single?
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   The same reason you are.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   You ready? Here's the reason you're single.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   It's directly from the scripture. It tells you why you're single.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Verse 32.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   "To be concerned about the Lord's affairs, how you can please the Lord."
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Verse 34.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   "To be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit."
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Verse 35.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   "You are single so that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord."
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   How novel of an idea.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   The reason that you are single.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   The reason that you're single is so that you can say,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   "Lord, here's my life. Take it and use it for your glory."
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   "That I can go and learn more about you."
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   "Everything about you."
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   "So that all my few little moments I have here on the earth were all about to die."
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   "God can take you and use you by about to die."
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   I just mean in comparison to how long you're going to be with Him.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   It's like that long.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   But a vapor, James says.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   And we can say, "God, use my life."
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Last week we talked about narcissism and wasting your life on you.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   And I think there's no greater way to waste your life than to live in desperation for another season.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Desperation. I'm not talking about just a desire, a God-given desire.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   I'm talking about an obsession.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   And so why are you single? Is it because you're tall?
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Or short?
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Or fat?
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Or skinny?
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Or ugly?
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Or too pretty?
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Or have BO?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Maybe.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Maybe those are some of the circumstances.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   But the reality of it is you're single so you can seek Him.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   So that you can use your life to find Him.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   And so don't be so desperate to lose the gift that He's given you.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Use the gift that He's given you.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   But what if you're here and you desire to be married?
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   You have a God-given desire to be married. Let's talk about it.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Verse 36.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   "If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to,"
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   "and if his passions are too strong and he feels he ought to marry,"
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   "he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should indeed get married."
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   And so my third point is simply this.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   That some of you are here and you're single for a season.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Some are single for a season.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   So you're here and this is a momentary kind of stop.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   It's not like a call to singleness.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   It's not a terminal gift of singleness or a chronic gift of singleness.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   It is a singleness for a season.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   It's going to turn into another season.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   And in fact, that's most of you in the room.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Most statistics out there, the most conservative one I could find,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   would say that about 80% of you will be married one day.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   So the vast majority of you.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   And so this is simply a season for you of singleness to which I say,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   the Apostle Paul would tell you, "Use this season well."
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Use it well.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   And so if you are dating someone, act honorably toward one another.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Your quarter-life crisis would be a much bigger crisis
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   if there was a pregnancy or an STD or a breakup after a sexual encounter
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   because those breakups are absolutely the hardest.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   But your quarter-life crisis is even greater
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   when you pursue another idol other than the Lord.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   And you act as though you are not afraid of Him
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   by the things that you give yourselves to.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And so I'm just telling you that sex is--
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   absolutely believe this--
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   sex will keep you in the wrong relationship too long,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   and it will keep you from the right relationship.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And I see it all the time.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   All the time I see it.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   I'm not just saying that.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   I'm not trying to scare you to follow God.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   I don't need to scare you to do anything.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   I'm telling you there is a way that He created us to do,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   things He created us to do so that we would find life in them.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   So don't trust a dude if he says he loves you
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   and his hand's moving toward anything other than a ring box,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   as it's been said.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   And if you do want to get married,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   for those of you--I want to talk with you for a second--
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   those in the room right now that desire to get married,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   I would tell you now is the time to train to be married.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   I think so often young adults don't realize
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   they are becoming more of what they already are.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   You're becoming something.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Like great spouses, great husbands and wives are not just born.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   They are created, and they are created when they're single.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   I've said this before,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   but I've never met any couple with marriage problems.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   And I meet couples all the time
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   who come to me with so-called marriage problems,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   but they're always single people problems
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   that they brought into their marriage.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   They're always problems that they had before their marriage
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   that they brought into marriage
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   that marriage put a big old magnifying glass on
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   and said, "Hey, look at this problem right here."
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   And so now is the time to deal with that.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   How do you deal with that?
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   You get a really dysfunctional roommate.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   You live in community.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Okay, you resolve conflict.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   You talk to people.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   You date in a way that honors God.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Why is it important to date in a way that honors God?
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Because if you're not,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   what you're telling the person that you're dating
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   is you are an adulterer.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Let me define that.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   An adulterer is someone who has sex
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   with someone they're not married to.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Here's why I say that.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Listen closely.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   I have a sexual desire.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   I know the Lord doesn't want me to express it in this way.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   I do not care.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   I'm going to follow my urges.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Can I tell you something?
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Trust me on this.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   You will have those urges.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   He or she will have those urges for another person
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   after they're married to you.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   They've already told you
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   they're committed to following those desires.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Do you see what I'm saying?
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   They said, "Hey, I do not fear God.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   "I follow my urges.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   "That's why I want to have sex with you right now
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   "outside of marriage."
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Later on, we're going to be married,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   and when I have those urges again,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   I'm going to follow them.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   If they tell me to have sex with someone else,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   I'm going to follow them.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   I'm telling you that now.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   I'm trying to.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   I'm jumping up and down,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   waving my arms, saying, "I'm an adulterer.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   "I'm an adulterer.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   "I'm an adulterer.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   "You want to marry me?
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   "Marry an adulterer."
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   That's what they're teaching you.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   And you're like, "Man, he just made that up."
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   No, I didn't.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   I see it all the time
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   over and over again.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   And so I don't think we realize
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   that you're becoming more of what you are.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   I had this call with this girl the other day, last week,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   and she wanted to live with her boyfriend,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   and she just asked me if I thought that was wise.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   And I thought she was wise for asking, honestly.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   I appreciated the question,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   and that she would reach out.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   And so we just talked through.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   She wanted me to give her the secular statistics,
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   which all would say, "That's a bad idea."
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   I say all.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Any credible one would say,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   "That's a really, really bad idea."
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   But I just said, "Hey, I'm not interested
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   "in talking about your behavior.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   "Let's talk about your belief."
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   And she said, "Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   "No, you don't understand.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   "I have this dream that he and I,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   "we're going to go to church together,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   "and we're going to take our kids to church,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   "and we're going to belong there,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   "and it's going to be awesome."
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   And I go, "Cool.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   "Can I ask you a question?"
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   She's like, "Yeah."
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   "Do you belong to a church right now?
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   "Are you a member at a church right now?
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   "And do you go there, and do you serve there,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   "and you're there every Sunday,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   "and throughout the week trying to be a part of the body?"
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   And she just said, "No, it's busy.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   "Life's busy, and I really hadn't found one that I like,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   "and we've been looking.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   "We interviewed churches for a couple weeks,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   "and we just didn't see one, so I just don't know.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   "But no, we're not really going to one right now."
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   Cool.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   I'm sure marriage and children
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   are going to make that a lot easier.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Come with me sometime when I'm trying to check in
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   my three kids into child care on Sunday morning.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   I don't think I've ever made it in here
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   before 30 minutes after the service started.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   I mean, it's like those things don't make it easier, friend.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   And by the way, what makes you think
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   you're going to do different than--
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   Some of you are here, and you're like,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   "Yeah, I do think, man, I'll be great.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   "I'll go to church, and I'll belong there."
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   And you're not going to church now.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   And I'm just saying, "No, you won't.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   "Let me just shoot you real straight.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   "No, you won't.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   "You're going to do more of later
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   "what you already do today.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   "That's what you're going to do.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   "That's what people do.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   "Life's a pattern.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   "You get stuck in a pattern.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   "That's what's going to happen."
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   You could change it right now.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   You could plead with God's Holy Spirit
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   to change it in you, to help you,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   and to move towards those things.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   You're becoming something.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   You're becoming something.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   And so if you can't be pure outside of marriage,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   what would make you think that you can be pure in marriage?
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   If you can't be pure--
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   And when I say pure, I mean like in and out of a relationship,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   like personally pure as well.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Like some of you are thinking,
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   "Man, yeah, I struggle with porn,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   "I struggle with masturbation,
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   "but that'll change when I'm married."
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   It'll change, it'll grow.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   It'll become a bigger problem in marriage.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   That's what will happen.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   You're looking at someone and saying,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   "I'm unfaithful.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   "Marry me.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   "I don't know how to be faithful."
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   So don't marry someone who has proven to be an adulterer.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   And I'm not talking about someone who's made a bad choice
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   or someone who has a past.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   Those people can change.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Listen, I was that person.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   I was a porn addict, sex addict.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   I surrendered my life to God through Jesus Christ,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   and he began to change me,
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   and I got committed and serious about that
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   by his grace at work and my life.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   And so I'm not saying someone who has a past.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   I'm saying someone who has a present, you know?
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   They're still in it.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Paul just says if you marry, you don't do what is wrong.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   If you remain single, you don't do what is wrong.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   The only wrong is to obsess over what is not available to you
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   or to pretend that you are in a life stage that you're not.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   And so my challenge for you is to use this season to be single-minded,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   meaning singularly focused on God and what he desires
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   but also living in the season that he has you,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   which is singleness.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   And so Paul writes this idea, and let's just be honest.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   It's in 1 Corinthians 7.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   There's some strange things going on in the church of Corinth.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Isn't Paul the only one who says this?
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   And any kind of weird here, like, man, he's just bitter, single man.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   That's what's going on here.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   Paul's just angry, and so he doesn't want anybody else to be married
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   because he's not married.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   He couldn't find a wife, and so he doesn't want me to have a wife.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   Is that what's going on here?
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   Did you know Jesus says the same thing?
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   Paul's just expounding on Jesus' idea.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   It comes from Matthew 19.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   Let me read it to you.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   "I tell you that"--okay, so they've asked him,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   "Jesus, is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   He says, "You know what?
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   "The Lord has brought together, 'Let man not separate.'"
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   In one word, "No," he says.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   And then he says this, "I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   "except for sexual immorality and marries another woman commits adultery."
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   And so the disciples, they hear this, and they're like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   "You're talking about, like, marriage.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   "Like, it's forever or something.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   "And if that's the situation between a husband and a wife,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   "it's better not to marry," to which Jesus doesn't say--
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   "No, no, no, hold on, guys.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   "No, no, no, hold on.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   "No, no, you misunderstood me.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   "It's not that it's not better.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   "Okay, let me explain this.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   "No, marriage is really good.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   "That's not what he says.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   "Let me just show you what he says, okay?"
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   They say, "It must be better not to marry," to which Jesus says,
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   "Not everyone can accept this word,
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   "but only to those to whom it has been given.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   "For there are eunuchs," which is a unique word.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   A eunuch is a person without reproductive parts.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   Okay, you tracking with me?
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   All right.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   "There are eunuchs who were born that way,
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   "and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others,
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   "which I say we should pray for those guys.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   "And there are those who choose to live like eunuchs."
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   Now, listen to this part, okay?
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   So eunuchs are those without reproductive organs.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   "There are those who choose to live like those
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   "without sexual desire for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   "And the one who can accept this should accept this."
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   What?
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Jesus says several profound things.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   Let me go over them.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   He says, one, marriage is forever.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   And so if it's forever, it takes a lot of preparation.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   We should prepare for it.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Two, he says there's only two options.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   You can choose celibacy or you can choose marriage.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   Those are your only two God-honoring options.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   You have celibacy, and then you have the outlet for sex,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   which is marriage.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   There's no other outlet for sexual release, okay?
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   Celibacy or marriage, those are your two options
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   according to the one who gave you life
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   and made the world and everything in it.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   And then he says, "There are some who are single
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   "for the sake of the kingdom."
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   And so they're not selfishly single,
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   not like, "Oh, man, single's fun.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   "I'm gonna play the field.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   "I'm gonna jack with hearts.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   "I'm gonna have friends with benefits."
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   No, they're single for only one reason,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   single for the sake of the kingdom.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   And so he's saying, he's expounding on this idea
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   that singleness is a gift to which a friend asked me,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   "Well, is it a gift like cancer?"
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   To which I say, "No."
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   Okay, it's not.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Like, cancer is bad.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Cancer's always bad.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   Singleness, the scripture says, is good.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   It's not like a rejoice in suffering kind of gift.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   It's a gift that you actually use
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   and honor God with.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   And so Jesus says, "Some should remain single
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   "for the sake of the kingdom."
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   Who is that?
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   It's those that can't or don't marry.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   And he says, "Some will, and they should do so forever."
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   Expounding, Paul is just expounding
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   on the idea of Jesus Christ as Savior.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   So in summary, to see your status
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   or your singleness as a gift,
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   trust the one who's entrusted it to you.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   The reason you're single is to be devoted to the Lord.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   And thirdly, a season of singleness
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   might be preparing you for a life of marriage.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   Therefore, prepare well.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Use this season to prepare well.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   It's interesting, the nutcracker,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   it ended up kind of being the highlight of Christmas.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   I mean, of course, there was the baby in the manger,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   and that was really the highlight of Christmas.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   But they had a lot of fun, let me just say,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   with this nutcracker.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   We would drive by the Elmore's house,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   and it was on their front porch,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   and it was lit up and everything.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   And so people would come and knock on their door.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   In fact, this one gentleman comes and goes,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   "Hey, man, I know the people that live here
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   "must have a sense of humor.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   "I mean, you got a nutcracker with a beer belly out there."
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   And my friend John got to engage with him
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   and share the gospel with him.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   And this thing that was considered this curse
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   ended up being such a tremendous blessing in the season
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   that we would continue to talk.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   We talk about it today still.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   In fact, it reminded, I mean, that's how I thought about it
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   is we were just dialoguing about how funny
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   that whole exchange was and how fun it ended up being,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   that it actually gave them life.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   It was actually something that they didn't need to lose,
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   but they could actually use.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   And I never want to play games with you guys,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   and so I just want to have a real transparent moment
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   with you as we end.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   It was a really hard week.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   The past two weeks, really difficult, challenging weeks.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   And what that looked like is we're moving,
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   we're building a home,
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   but we have to move from our house into a temporary house
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   so that we can eventually move into that house.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   So we're moving, knowing that we're going to have to move again.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   I'm just like, "Oh."
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   And so then we had a garage sale.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   And so garage sales are hard because you take all of this stuff
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   that you invested money in, you put it on your lawn,
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   and you exchange it for a nickel.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   And so people are coming over and taking all of my stuff,
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   and I don't like that, and they're giving me pennies for it.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   And so in the midst of the garage sale,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   there was just a lot of challenging things that happened.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   And then Monica begins to complain about her leg,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   saying that her leg hurts, to which I look at it,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   and right here on the back of her leg is this red mark.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   And so she gets on an antibiotic in the midst of that,
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   but the red mark, it just kind of starts growing and growing.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   And I'm thinking, "Hey, the antibiotic's got to be working."
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   And she's telling me, "Hey, babe, my leg really hurts."
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   And I'm kind of like, "Hey, suck it up,"
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   which I know makes me husband of the year.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   But I'm like, "Hey, it's going to be okay."
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   And we got a lot going on.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   And she even says, "Man, I think the first time we had a garage sale,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   it was a lot easier."
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   And I'm like, "Yeah, absolutely, because I don't know if you noticed,
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   but Weston's trying to ride the skateboard in the street,
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   and he's 20 months old, and the girls are chasing the neighbor's dog over there.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   Come back, Presley!"
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Okay, now, "Okay, what is that, sir?
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   You'd like to give me a nickel for that plasma? Okay, here you go."
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   And so all of these things are going on, and I'm like,
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   "Yes, it was easier when we were--life was simpler, and life's not so simple now."
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   And she's like, "By the way, my leg hurts."
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   I'm like, "It's going to be okay. You're taking an antibiotic."
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   [laughter]
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   And so about 10 p.m., she's like, "I'm just going to text my dermatologist."
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   I'm like, "Fine."
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   [laughter]
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   She texts a picture of her leg.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   Dermatologist calls immediately back and says,
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   "Hey, you need to go to the ER right now."
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   So I'm like, "How can we go to the ER? We've got these three kids in the other room."
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   So I'm like, "Hey, can somebody come over and watch the kids
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   while we go to the ER so they can tell us that nothing's wrong?"
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   And so then my--I know, wicked person.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   So somebody comes over and watches the kids, and we leave,
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   and we go to the emergency room to which they say--they rush us to the back and say,
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   "I was so glad that you came in. Her body's fighting this infection.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   That's what's happening. We need to lance this--
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   we need to cut into her leg right now."
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   And I was like, "Really? Hey, babe, I'm sorry."
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   [laughter]
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   And I just went real nice, kind of through all of that.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   Like it just felt like the weight of the world, and like I was teaching here,
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   and then I'm teaching in Houston on Thursday,
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   and all of it--I taught this morning at this thing,
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   and just like the distraction of ministry, and I forsake.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   I took for granted my ministry.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   I missed out on my primary ministry.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   I let you guys down. I let my family down.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   I let my community down.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   I couldn't stand before you and say, "Follow me as I follow Christ,"
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   in the way that I strive to live with my wife in an understanding way,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   1 Peter 3, 7, or Ephesians 5, 25,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   that I would love her as Christ loved the church and gave his life for his bride.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   I missed my primary ministry.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   And can I tell you something else?
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   When I was single, I missed my primary ministry.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Man, I would love to be up here and be like, "Hey, do it just like I did.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Don't do it like I did."
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   Probably my greatest regret in the world
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   is that I missed out on ministry when I was single.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   Man, I look back on those days like, "Man, what if--we could have done that.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   Man, we could have changed that nation.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   We could have made that whole nation have water or food to eat.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   We could have done that."
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   Man, I could have--that neighbor that I had who was lost,
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   he could be in heaven if the Lord would have used me in that way,
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   but he didn't because I wasn't available to be used.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   Man, I could have studied the Word.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   I could have known the Scriptures like people who really know the Bible.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   I could have taught and drawn from my 20s, but I didn't read the Bible.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   All while I called myself a Christian, I was playing games.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   I wasn't a Christian. I was a Dallasite.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   I look like Dallas and smell like Dallas and talk like Dallas,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   and I did the things that Dallas said.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   All while I called myself a Christian, and I wasn't a Christian.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   If I would have died, I wouldn't have been with God
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   because I didn't fully understand what he did to set me free from Dallas,
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   free from my sins.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   I didn't understand what he did so that I could use my singleness for his glory.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   I want you to plug into a church and belong there.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   I beg you to. This is your week.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   Get in a community, a group of friends that you're doing life with.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   Sit across from them and say, "Hey, guys, is there weird quirkiness in me
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   that you think God wants to change? Is there a reason that I'm single
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   and I don't want to be?" If you don't want to be, maybe you want to be.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   But let them be honest with you. Say, "Hey, guys, what if?"
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Ask that a lot when you're single. Ask, "What if?" a lot.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   "Man, what if we moved there? What if we moved to West Dallas
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   and began to just love on people down there?
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   Do you think we could change a community?"
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   Oh, yeah, you can. Oh, yeah, gifted folks in this room, you absolutely can.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   These are the things I want you to do. All right?
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   Listen, here's what I promise you. God's Word promises you.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   You won't regret it. Keep having sex, you'll regret it.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   Living with your significant other, you'll regret it.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   If you're a follower of Christ, you will regret it.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   Keep looking at porn, you'll regret it.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   Keep wasting your singleness, you'll regret it.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   But you say, "Hey, God, here's my life. Would you use me?"
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   I'm not focusing on the don'ts. This isn't a don't message.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   This is, "Hey, go and be used," message.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   Surrender to God, message.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   Look to Him and say, "Lord, how do you want to use me?" message.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Don't try to lose the gift. Use the gift.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Let me pray.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   Father, would you help us do that?
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   Would you make us believe that, God?
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   Would you stir in our hearts that reality, Lord?
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   Would you show my friends, would you convict the ones you need to convict, Father,
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   that your Spirit would sit heavy on their hearts,
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   showing them the things that they've done that have been a dishonor to you,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   and Lord, remind them of the things that you've done
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   so that they don't have to pay for those things,
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   that you've paid for those things through Jesus,
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   that they don't have to leave guilty, Father, that they can leave new, Father.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   And for other ones who have been wasting their singleness, God,
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   I pray that you would stir in their hearts and minds
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   the things that they can do to live in a way that's brave,
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   to live in a way to be used by you.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   As your eyes go to and fro, looking for hearts that are fully yours, God,
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   that you would see us and use us and find us available to you to be used, God.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   For we love you and we love the way you work and move.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   It is in Jesus' name. Amen.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   [Silence]
