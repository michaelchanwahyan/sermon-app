[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:27.600]   - Love it, awesome.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.620]   We are continuing Romans eight.
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.220]   Hello, Fort Worth, hello, friends in the room
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.060]   and friends in Houston.
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.340]   I'm gonna read the passage that we are in tonight
[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.660]   and then we will dive into the text.
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.420]   So this comes from Romans chapter eight.
[00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.020]   We're gonna start in verse 18
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.460]   and we will go through verse 27.
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.900]   Paul says this, "I consider that our present sufferings
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.980]   "are not worth comparing with the glory
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.900]   "that will be revealed in us.
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.180]   "For the creation waits in eager expectation
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.700]   "for the children of God to be revealed.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.060]   "For the creation was subjected to frustration,
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.860]   "not by its own choice, but by the will
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.940]   "of the one who subjected it in hope,
[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.860]   "that the creation itself will be liberated
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.380]   "from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom
[00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.380]   "of the glory of the children of God.
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.900]   "We know that the whole creation," that's our world,
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.940]   "has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.180]   "up to this present time.
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.260]   "And not only so, but we ourselves,
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.380]   "who have the first fruits of the Spirit,
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.620]   "are groan inwardly as we wait eagerly
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.020]   "for our adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies.
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.180]   "For in this hope we were saved,
[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.460]   "but hope that's not seen is no hope at all.
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.260]   "For who hopes for what they already have?
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.940]   "But if we hope for what we do not yet have,
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.660]   "we wait for it patiently.
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:53.220]   "In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness,
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.340]   "and we do not know what we ought to pray for,
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.700]   "but the Spirit himself intercedes for us
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.380]   "through wordless groans.
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.700]   "And he who searches our hearts
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.860]   "knows the mind of the Spirit,
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.220]   "because the Spirit intercedes for God's people
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.100]   "in accordance with the will of God."
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.100]   Let me pray before we dive in.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.460]   Father, I pray just for the next 30 minutes
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.820]   that we'll have together,
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.420]   I pray that you would use your word
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.700]   to strengthen the hearts of my friends in this room
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.380]   who have a relationship with you.
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.460]   Would you allow us to see more of who you are?
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.020]   You tell us in your word that when we see Jesus,
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.740]   we're changed from one degree of glory to the next.
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.860]   And so would you do that?
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.540]   That's something no message, no song,
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.940]   no music could ever do.
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.980]   Father, I pray for friends who don't know you.
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.260]   Would they be exposed to and encounter you in a real way?
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.620]   For those of us who do,
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.620]   would you even raise our awareness of you,
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.020]   your presence in our life, in our world,
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.740]   your sovereignty and control of all things?
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.940]   We love you, thank you for your word.
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.300]   Teach us now and encourage us now, amen.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.460]   Well, I have a four-month-old son named Crew,
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.780]   and so we are not sleeping much at all right now.
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.940]   And this past Saturday,
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.460]   there was a day where we had a wedding
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.780]   to go to that evening,
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.900]   and he did something that he's been kinda
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.820]   in this last week or two doing a lot lately,
[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.260]   which was scream his head off for like seven hours.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260]   And so the day started and it was going great,
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.740]   and there will be these moments and times
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.260]   where we just woke up and all of a sudden,
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.220]   he will start inexplicably crying and screaming out,
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.340]   and we'll hold him and we'll try to do
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.940]   all the different things, change the diaper,
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.340]   what's wrong with this baby?
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.300]   There's no instruction manual that came with this thing,
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.460]   so we're trying to figure out what do we do,
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.980]   how do we get him to stop crying?
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.380]   He cries, he'll stop for a little bit,
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.300]   then he started crying again.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.220]   It was really a day unlike any day we've had yet.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.740]   And it gets even more depressing and sad
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.900]   whenever you go into the evening stages.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.100]   And so the last three days have been days
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.100]   where at 3 a.m. this morning,
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.340]   I'm like, Lord, please return right now, please.
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.340]   I'm so tired, please.
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.180]   Even right now, if I fall asleep up here, V,
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.420]   just assume I'm in prayer and come back up
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.520]   and play the last song.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.260]   But it's just been one of those seasons
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.620]   where it's like, man, what is going on?
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.620]   What is wrong with this baby?
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.760]   I can't figure out what is going on here.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.420]   And I was telling a friend about this
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.620]   and just telling him, 'cause I'm the kind of person
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.380]   that has to tell if I'm going through something hard,
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.820]   I want everyone to know about it,
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.020]   or if I worked out, I'm like,
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.660]   I worked out yesterday or three weeks ago.
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.540]   And so I'm that guy.
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.980]   And I was telling a friend about this yesterday,
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.940]   it was JP, we were at lunch,
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.540]   and I was like, dude, I don't know what is wrong
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.700]   with the baby, maybe it's colic-y,
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.080]   we took his temperature, can't figure out,
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.740]   screaming like crazy, I mean, I know, I know.
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.600]   It's our cross to bear.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.100]   And he's like, dude, I know what your problem is.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.000]   It's a baby.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.700]   And I'm like, that is not true.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.280]   It cannot be this hard for everyone.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.700]   That is not the case.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.460]   No one else, or it cannot be like,
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.780]   this is just normal for everyone.
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.420]   People would not have more than one kid
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.700]   if this was the case for everybody, I guarantee it.
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.340]   And he's like, yes, there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.820]   It's a baby.
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.680]   That's just part of the stage of life that you're in.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.940]   And I start there because I think that common question
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.460]   about, hey, what's wrong with this child,
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.380]   is not unlike questions that have really been a part
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.860]   of stages of my life and days past.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.820]   I find that all of us have shared times
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.020]   where we find ourselves wondering,
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.940]   hey, what is wrong with this?
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.580]   What is wrong with this coworker?
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.380]   What is wrong with this parent?
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.860]   What is wrong with this job?
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.700]   What is wrong with the weather outside?
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.300]   What is wrong with my car?
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.140]   What is wrong with this dating relationship?
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.700]   What is wrong with me?
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.260]   What is wrong with my lack of dating relationships,
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.940]   or me that's leading to that?
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.900]   I think all of us have found ourselves asking,
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.740]   or at times, different questions around,
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.620]   hey, what is wrong?
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.600]   And really, all of those questions could be said
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.180]   in one question, which is, what is wrong with our world?
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.260]   And tonight, the Apostle Paul, in this text,
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.140]   is going to lay out exactly what is wrong
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.180]   with the world that we live in.
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.700]   Because just like me, in that scenario with the baby,
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.780]   where I'm like, man, I wish somebody would've told me
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.860]   this is what is about to happen,
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.740]   many of us find ourselves in this world
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.300]   where maybe no one has ever told you
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.180]   exactly what is wrong with this world.
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.100]   And the Apostle Paul begins to answer
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.020]   one of the biggest questions that you and I
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.580]   will wrestle with in this life,
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.460]   is how do we reconcile suffering and the goodness of God?
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.020]   How do we find hope in a world
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.740]   that feels hopelessly broken?
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.100]   And he's about to lay out the answer to those questions.
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.380]   So tonight, we're gonna explore
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.980]   verses 18 through 27 of Romans chapter eight.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.580]   We are in a series called Romans eight.
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.020]   It is believed by many scholars
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.460]   to be the greatest chapter in all of the Bible.
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.480]   It was a chapter that had significant influence
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.520]   on all kinds of heroes of the faith.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.500]   So we've been exploring it for the past couple weeks.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.580]   Last week, JP covered verses 14 through 17
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.900]   and how we are children of God in Christ.
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.600]   If you have put your faith in Jesus,
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.740]   you have been adopted by the King of kings.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.880]   And now Paul begins to lay out where our kingdom lies
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.660]   and how we can face this world
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.300]   that seems hopelessly broken.
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.220]   So we're gonna pick it up in verse 18
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.620]   and we will dive right in.
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.460]   Paul says, "I consider that our present sufferings,"
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.380]   so whatever you're suffering right now in this room,
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.000]   this is a bold statement from the Apostle Paul,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.640]   "is not worth comparing with the glory or with the future,
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.440]   "with something that's about to take place,
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.920]   "with something ahead of us,
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.020]   "that the present sufferings we experience
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.920]   "are not even worth mentioning,
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.100]   "with the glory that is to come
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.760]   "that's going to be revealed to us and around us."
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.820]   That the Apostle Paul, who was not a stranger to suffering,
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.060]   because when I read that, I'm like,
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.980]   man, Paul, you don't know what so many people
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.820]   in our world are suffering inside of this room.
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.700]   You may be walking through the pain of a heartbreak
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.860]   in a broken relationship.
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.540]   Maybe you're walking through cancer, job loss,
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.980]   through the loss of a loved one, a parent.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.860]   And the Apostle Paul has the nerve to say,
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.660]   look, I consider that it's not even worth talking about
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.260]   all the suffering in our world
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:22.340]   when you compare it to the glory that's ahead of us.
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.460]   And I'd say two things about the Apostle Paul that we know.
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.540]   One, he was not a stranger to suffering.
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.620]   In other words, he didn't write this
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.540]   from a lawn chair on the beach
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.220]   with a margarita or a mimosa being like,
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.380]   and then the suffering is nothing to compare.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.500]   He wrote this likely from a prison cell.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.780]   The Apostle Paul suffered in ways
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.820]   that honestly most of us will never have to.
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.900]   He was beaten with a whip with nails on the end of it
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.180]   nine different times, five different times, sorry.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.080]   He was beaten with rods as if that was not enough
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.700]   three different times, permanently disfigured.
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.360]   He was shipwrecked three times.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.580]   He was stoned, not like smoked something,
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.740]   stoned like pelted with rocks, stoned.
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.700]   He was a man who was very well acquainted.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.820]   Scholars estimate he spent one quarter
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.060]   of his life in prison.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:08.600]   And Paul writes, it's not even worth talking about.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.220]   Further, if you were walking through suffering,
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.780]   here's what I know about Paul.
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.620]   He would be the first to mourn with you.
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.700]   He wouldn't wanna minimize it.
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.020]   He said, mourn with those who mourn.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.860]   And yet at the same time,
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.260]   he's also giving us a big picture worldview
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.740]   that whenever we understand
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.060]   if we could have the perspective that Paul does
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:31.260]   of comparing our present circumstances,
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.860]   the broken world we're a part of,
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.540]   if we could just see for a moment
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.480]   what awaits us in eternity,
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.700]   it wouldn't even be worth mentioning is what he says.
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.020]   And he begins to lay out what awaits us in eternity.
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.820]   Here's what he says, verse 19.
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.680]   For the creation, that's our world,
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.500]   that's everything that is.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.420]   Stars, moon, mountains, you,
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.580]   the grass, trees, animals.
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.940]   For the creation waits an eager expectation
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.380]   or straining forward, waiting, longing for.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.120]   What are they waiting for?
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.820]   For the children of God to be revealed.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.620]   In other words, for Jesus to come back
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.620]   and set up finally his kingdom.
[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.980]   The creation is straining.
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.220]   Everything around you is waiting for that day.
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.100]   And Paul begins to talk about the future.
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.100]   And it's as though he's like,
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.620]   and let me make sure you understand
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.420]   why the creation is waiting.
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.500]   And he goes from the future back to the past.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.540]   Here's what he says in verse 20.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.700]   For the creation was, that's again,
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.080]   our world around us, was subjected to frustration.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.440]   He begins to talk about an event in the past.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.900]   Not by its own choice, but by the will of the one
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.260]   who subjected it in hope that the creation itself
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.060]   will be liberated from its bondage to decay
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.660]   and brought into the freedom of the glory
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.620]   of the children of God.
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.720]   So Paul gives us the indication to our first point,
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.100]   which is the source of our greatest hurts in this world.
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.060]   The source of our greatest hurts is sin.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.960]   He says, look, before I go into what's waiting us in glory,
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.780]   let me cover what's taken place in the past.
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.340]   Let me explain some of the world in which you live.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.060]   All of us, he gives us an indication
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.940]   in the context of everything we've ever known.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.020]   He says, you live in a world
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.420]   that was never meant to be this way.
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.340]   And he records this event in the past.
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.280]   He's talking about the Garden of Eden.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.680]   This moment in time when sin entered into the world,
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.540]   that God created the world perfectly
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.420]   and sin entered because of Adam and Eve disobeying God
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.860]   and creation was fractured.
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.620]   Everything in our world was broken.
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.900]   He says, subjected to frustration
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.940]   and put in bondage to death and decay.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.760]   That when Adam and Eve chose that, hey, God,
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.220]   you know what, I don't want you to be God,
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.660]   I'm gonna be my own God,
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:43.540]   they cut off the creator from the creation through sin.
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.060]   Sin always brings death.
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.660]   It cut off the perfect harmony that God had with his people,
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.600]   with the world around us.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.020]   God was there on the planet hanging out with Adam and Eve.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.820]   Everybody's naked, it's amazing.
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.420]   All of a sudden, they disobey God
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.660]   and everything's fractured.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.380]   And Paul says, not only was man's relationship
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.860]   with God fractured, the tree's relationship
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.420]   with their creator's fractured.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.300]   The wind around us, tornadoes,
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.940]   all kinds of things like that came as a product
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.920]   of this fracturing when sin entered the world
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.100]   and death came with it.
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:19.100]   Because death is a result of not being connected to life.
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.060]   And when you cut God out or you kick him out,
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.940]   you invite death because you're kicking life out.
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.140]   In Adam and Eve's decision, Paul says,
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.180]   trapped the world around us that we see in bondage.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.380]   Trees were never meant to die.
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.620]   Animals were never meant to kill one another.
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:40.260]   Dementia, cancer, the world around us that we see,
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.300]   babies were never meant to die or be born stillborn.
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.080]   Men were never meant to die of a heart attack
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.060]   in their mid-30s.
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.860]   The world was fractured and everything was broken.
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.300]   And Paul says, before you understand,
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.280]   let me explain the context for which we live.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.420]   It wasn't that God invented a world like this.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.260]   It wasn't like this from the beginning.
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.480]   Man invited sin into the world.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.660]   Man often, who's responsible for sin,
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.740]   now gets angry at God after bringing sin into the world,
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.220]   but God did not create it.
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.980]   Man kicked him out and chaos came in.
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.060]   We use an illustration.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.700]   When I was around like 11 years old,
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.060]   my mother went out of town and she basically
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.460]   went on a vacation to see some family that we had in Kansas.
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.220]   She left me and my siblings with my older brother,
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.060]   who's five years older.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:24.880]   He was gonna watch us.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.720]   He could drive the car.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.540]   It's gonna be great.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.180]   She was the one who kept order in the household.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.580]   She kept things clean, did the laundry,
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.860]   made meals, all that stuff.
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.520]   All of a sudden, the one who keeps things in order
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.460]   has left the premises, and all of a sudden,
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.620]   we are left on our own.
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.420]   And so it turns into a weekend that is like Lord of the Flies.
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.060]   We're eating Blue Bell for breakfast.
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.960]   We don't know how to do the laundry thing machine.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.460]   Milk straight out of the milk gallon.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.340]   Everything's left out.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.180]   We don't know what we're doing
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.980]   because the person who kept order had left
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.340]   and chaos took place.
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:56.180]   In the same way, when man kicked God out of their life
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.460]   or said, "I wanna be God,"
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.740]   they took the one who kept order
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.500]   and they kicked him from their life.
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.620]   They kicked him from our world and chaos took place.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.740]   And we see it everywhere we look.
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.660]   I mean, why do cells multiply in your body
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.780]   and attack your body?
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.860]   That's what we call cancer.
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.940]   Because the creation was subjected to frustration,
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.640]   put in bondage to death,
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.340]   because sin was brought into the world
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.940]   and everything fractured.
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.440]   And Paul says, "This is what took place in the world."
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.980]   This is the world in which we find ourselves.
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.960]   That the creation, in Genesis 3, we're told,
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.820]   was placed under a curse.
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.140]   The curse of not having a relationship with God.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.180]   The curse of being disconnected with God.
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.300]   I mean, honestly, we don't even have to prove that like,
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.580]   hey, if you're not connected with God,
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.700]   you kinda go crazy, things spin out.
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.620]   A lot of us in the room could stand up and go,
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.740]   "Yeah, I kinda drifted and woo,
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.340]   "things went crazy for a while,
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.260]   "and I'm back in church and God is using it
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.540]   "and my life is growing."
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.900]   But it's not hard for us to imagine,
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.600]   hey, when you drift away from the one who keeps order,
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:05.860]   the creator, the creation begins to invite chaos
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.820]   and that's what took place.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.500]   And Paul says, "This is the world
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.740]   "in which we find ourselves."
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.900]   You need to understand the context in which you live.
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.380]   It was subjected to futility, but not without hope,
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.060]   even in God saying, "Cursed is the ground,"
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.700]   Genesis 3, you can go read it later.
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.580]   He gave them a hope of a promise,
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.620]   but this will not remain forever.
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.360]   Which is what Paul means when he says, "In hope."
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.220]   And he gave a promise that there will be a day
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.920]   when a descendant of Adam, we call him Jesus,
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.380]   will crush Satan and sin.
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.100]   It's verse 15 of Genesis chapter three.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.220]   But until that day, creation right now,
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.780]   everything in the world around us longs to be restored
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.340]   to Eden, longs to be restored to paradise.
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.620]   It waits eagerly, is the word Paul uses.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.040]   As though it almost remembers.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.200]   It remembers that it wasn't intended to die.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.660]   Everything that you walk past,
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.820]   when you go on a walk at the lake at White Rock,
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.740]   if you live in Dallas, or you go on a lake,
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.100]   Grapevine or wherever you go,
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.060]   everything that you see, every bird in the air,
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.760]   it was never meant to be this way.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.940]   And Paul begins to lay out that it won't always be this way.
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.400]   He says this in verse 22.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:25.140]   "We know that the whole creation has been groaning
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.100]   "as in the pains of childbirth,
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.220]   "right up to this present time.
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.620]   "And not only has the whole creation,
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.200]   "or our world been groaning in childbirth pains,
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.640]   "but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit,
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.300]   "grown inwardly as we eagerly await
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.600]   "our adoption to sonship,
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.900]   "the redemption of our bodies.
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.140]   "For in this hope we were saved,
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.700]   "but hope that is not seen is no hope.
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.640]   "For who hopes for what we already have?
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.900]   "But if we hope for what we do not yet have,
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:00.040]   "we wait for it patiently, or with endurance we endure."
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.980]   This brings us to our second idea in this text,
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.360]   the first one, of the source of our greatest hurt
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.140]   in this world is sin.
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.180]   The second idea is the source of our greatest hope
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.440]   is the resurrection.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.220]   And you may be going, where do you see that in that text?
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.340]   Let me explain.
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.380]   What Paul just laid out is that the world around us,
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.640]   creation has been groaning in the pains of childbirth.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.740]   Why did Paul use pains of childbirth?
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.220]   It's an analogy that's used throughout the New Testament.
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.820]   Here's what happens in childbirth pains.
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.540]   I'm gonna really explain how you have a baby.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.220]   Really, are you about to do this, David?
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.740]   Here's what happens, you all know what happens
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.100]   in childbirth, but childbirth pains,
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.280]   there's two things about them.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.760]   They're temporary.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.240]   When my wife gave birth to the baby,
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.060]   the pain, it was temporary.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.740]   I knew that it was not gonna last forever,
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:44.980]   like literally forever.
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.460]   It was only gonna be temporary.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.620]   The second thing about that pain
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.660]   is that it was filled with hope,
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.100]   that it was moving toward something.
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.260]   And Paul says all the pain in our world,
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.180]   the world that we live in, it's like creation is pregnant,
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.720]   and the pains of pushing forward to new life,
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.980]   it's pain in our world that's temporary.
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.780]   All the pain that you and I experience is temporary.
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.480]   It will not last, Paul says.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.060]   And it's filled with hope.
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.060]   Every time that we experience pain, he's saying,
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.060]   we're reminded that we're not home yet,
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.940]   that the world is moving towards new life.
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.700]   That's why he uses the analogy of pregnancy.
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:26.100]   And Paul answers the question, really,
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.140]   as he lays out, honestly, he addresses
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.380]   one of the fundamental misunderstandings
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.060]   we have of heaven.
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.580]   What he just said, and why our hope is in the resurrection,
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.500]   is that the world groans to be made new.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.780]   And you may not know this, but the world around us
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.380]   that place that we are, one of the things
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.660]   that people think about heaven and about eternity
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.060]   is we'll say things, and I think sometimes even myself
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.860]   or people who teach can say things like,
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.140]   hey, you're gonna spend eternity in heaven
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.220]   with God up there forever and ever and ever,
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.860]   and we give this distorted perspective
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:54.780]   on really what heaven's like.
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:55.980]   Maybe you think of heaven and you're like,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:56.860]   I don't know what we're gonna do.
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.980]   We're gonna be in the clouds, harps, wearing diapers,
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.580]   I guess, or what are we gonna do for all,
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.860]   am I even gonna like it?
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.220]   It sounds like, man, that's gonna be a long time.
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.260]   That'd feel a lot of heaven.
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.420]   Are we gonna enjoy that?
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.740]   And the idea that you will spend eternity
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.620]   somewhere out there flies in the face
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.020]   of what the New Testament teaches.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.580]   The Bible teaches that the creation around us
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.220]   longs for the sons to be revealed
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.840]   or longs to be made new.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.260]   Like in other words, Christianity is not just the message
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.340]   of like, hey, believe in Jesus
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.640]   and you'll go to heaven forever.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.580]   The message of Christianity is that if you believe in Jesus,
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.220]   you will be a part of the new world.
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.820]   Like that was the message of the early church.
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.380]   It wasn't, hey, believe and you'll go up to heaven
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.260]   and float up there forever.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.260]   No, it was a new world is coming.
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.580]   Jesus resurrected from the dead.
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.500]   We thought he was dead.
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.780]   He came back to life and anyone who accepts him
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.900]   will live again.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:47.900]   You will rise.
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.580]   That's why our hope is in the resurrection.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.140]   Paul just said, the world around us cries out.
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.940]   Trees cry out, make us new.
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.260]   We were never intended to die.
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.340]   We long for the day when we will live forever.
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.700]   Animals, everything, your dog, you and your body
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.220]   longs to be a part of eternity.
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.340]   Eternity is placed inside of man
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.780]   and the world around us longs that the eternity
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.020]   will be spent not in heaven far off, but on this earth.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.060]   This was what the early church proclaimed
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.060]   as they went around, is that what happened at Easter
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.900]   with Jesus in the resurrection
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.900]   will happen to our whole world.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.540]   It will rise again.
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.680]   It will be resurrected.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.780]   You will spend eternity.
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:26.740]   Let me say it this way.
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:31.740]   On this earth made new, you will spend forever
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.580]   and ever and ever, not in heaven somewhere, here.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.420]   Maybe not in Dallas, but here.
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.940]   I don't know if I'll call it Dallas.
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.700]   Be redeemed, if nothing else, probably better weather.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.140]   But you'll spend eternity here.
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.260]   You and I, followers of Jesus, will spend forever and ever
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.300]   on this world made new.
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.900]   The reason creation cries out, make us new.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.540]   Blades of grass are dying and they're groaning out.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.180]   We weren't made for this world
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.040]   and there's gonna come a day, Paul says,
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.620]   the groans will be put away and creation will be made new.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.660]   What happened at Easter with Jesus
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:08.180]   was just the first of what will happen everywhere.
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.340]   And the message of Christianity was,
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.940]   be a part of the new world.
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.780]   It's coming right.
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.020]   We'll take over wrong.
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.900]   Everything broken will be fixed and put back together.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.380]   The curse will be lifted.
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.900]   Our world will be forever changed.
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.820]   And Paul says, that's why,
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:28.820]   despite the suffering in our world, we can have hope
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.960]   because our hope is not in the broken world
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.960]   around us that we see.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.800]   Like, we live in a world that's full of suffering.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.480]   Paul's like, what do you expect?
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.760]   It's like telling a guy who's like,
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.360]   oh, I have a baby that's crying all the time.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.180]   What do you expect?
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.920]   You have a baby, dummy.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.760]   What do you expect?
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.480]   When you live in a world of suffering, he would say,
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.980]   don't put your hope in this world.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.360]   It's a suffering world.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.720]   The world keeps letting me down.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.520]   Paul would say, you're in a let me down world.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.160]   Don't put your hope here.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.360]   Our hope as Christians is in the world to be made new.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.840]   Right now, we live in a world that's hopelessly broken.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.540]   We're suffering as a part of the deal.
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.420]   Jesus said, I promise you this,
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:11.480]   you will suffer in this world,
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.480]   but there will be a day when the world will rise again.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.980]   And everyone who trusts in Jesus,
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.360]   you will literally come out of the grave.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.440]   I know it sounds doo-doo-doo crazy.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.360]   That's what Christianity teaches.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.720]   Physically, your body will rise,
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.680]   and you will live forever.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.080]   That's why Paul says Jesus is the firstborn
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.320]   among many brothers, who will rise again in the flesh.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.080]   Let me just give some of the verses that inform this idea.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.200]   This was at the heart of the early church.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.680]   It wasn't just like, oh, that's kind of a part.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.200]   This was the epicenter.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.340]   There's a new world coming, and if you accept Jesus,
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.480]   if you will be a part of it, you will live in the new world,
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.040]   and you will live eternally on this earth.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.160]   Heaven is not your destination forever.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.960]   In fact, the Bible says heaven will be wed to earth,
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.280]   and God will live on this earth with his people.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.720]   Here's what it says in Revelation chapter five,
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.120]   or chapter 21, verses one through five.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.420]   It talks about the new heavens and the new earth,
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.040]   and God dwelling with his people forever.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.800]   There will be no more death, it says,
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.760]   no more crying, no more pain.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.600]   I will make all things new.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.080]   Isaiah 11 says this.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.240]   There will be a new world,
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.560]   and the animal kingdom will be restored.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.600]   The wolf and lamb will live together.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.240]   No longer will even the animal kingdom
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.020]   be torn apart by hostility.
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.840]   The leopard will lie down with the baby goat.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.880]   That a little child will lead the leopard and the lion.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.760]   That there will be no danger, there will be no death.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.640]   Nothing will hurt, he says, this is Isaiah 11.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.640]   Nothing will hurt or be destroyed in all my holy mountain,
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.000]   because the earth will be filled
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.840]   with people who know the Lord.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.360]   Isaiah 66, 65.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.280]   I will create a new heavens and a new earth.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.640]   The former things will not be remembered.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.700]   I love this verse.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:00.520]   The sound of weeping and crying will never be heard again.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.600]   Never again will there be an infant
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.640]   who lives just a few days,
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.280]   or an old man who does not live out his years.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.200]   Hebrews 12, God will through fire destroy the earth
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.800]   and destroy all sin and refine it,
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.360]   and everything that was not of him,
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.080]   everything broken will be finally restored,
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.180]   and the earth will be made new.
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.360]   Revelation 22, verse three.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.740]   The curse and the new earth will be no more.
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.100]   The curse will be lifted.
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.960]   That included in our hope is the resurrection,
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.220]   or the source of our greatest hope is the resurrection,
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:39.080]   because what happened to Jesus is gonna happen to you.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.520]   You don't have to fear death anymore.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.440]   Our world will be set free once and finally,
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.200]   once and for all, and death will be no more,
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.480]   and everything broken will be made new
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.080]   and restored finally and fully forever.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:59.360]   It almost reads like a fairy tale, doesn't it?
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.860]   Like Paul, like there's this curse on the land,
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.420]   there's darkness, but there's coming a day
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.860]   when the curse will snap.
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.880]   It's almost like, hey, there's winter everywhere,
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.000]   Paul says, but winter is beginning to,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.880]   the ice is beginning to melt.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.080]   And Paul lays out this like fairy tale.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.120]   I mean, think about it.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.720]   Here's the novel of a fairy tale,
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.400]   that there's a city or a land
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.600]   that comes underneath control of a villain of darkness.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.560]   Call him Jafar, call him Scar, call him Darth Vader,
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.900]   call him the Joker, call him the Wicked Witch,
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.120]   call him whatever you wanna call him,
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.480]   call him Captain Hook, that there's been this land,
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.600]   and it's underneath the terror and the reign of darkness,
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.880]   and all of a sudden, a hero emerges,
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.860]   and the hero comes, and he restores the kingdom
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.240]   to the rightful place that it was always intended to be.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.200]   Call him Simba, call him Aladdin, call him Dorothy,
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.500]   call him Batman, call him Luke Skywalker,
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.440]   call him every single story that we know, every fairy tale.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.800]   Why does every fairy tale, every Disney movie
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.120]   has at its epicenter this same plot?
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.520]   Well, because the writers of Disney,
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.520]   the writers of these stories know that there's something
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.320]   that resonates with mankind in that story.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.280]   Why does it resonate?
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.640]   Because it's imprinted on every single person,
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.360]   every heart in this room that longs
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.080]   for something otherworldly to be true,
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.400]   for the curse to be broken.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.700]   We know there's something wrong with the world.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.240]   And Hollywood's making a fortune off the fact
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.560]   that this story rings inside of our hearts,
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.460]   and it rings because it's true.
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.680]   And one day, we will see it take place,
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.080]   and the kingdom will be restored,
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.800]   this earth will be restored, and you'll live here
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.080]   forever in perfect harmony with God,
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.880]   with no weeping and no crying, the scriptures tell us.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.080]   If you've accepted Jesus, the curse will be broken.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.640]   And so till that day, we wait with hope,
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.080]   not without suffering, because we're in a world
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.240]   that's broken, and I wish that I could say,
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.040]   hey, there's not gonna be any suffering
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.460]   for anybody in this room, it's gonna be awesome.
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.520]   But that's just not the case.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.080]   And Paul says, why would you even expect that?
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:11.760]   You're in a broken world, but it's not gonna last.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.540]   Just like childbirth pains, they're temporary.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.720]   And let that pain push you towards hope.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.780]   One day, it will be no more.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.740]   This world is fleeting, falling away.
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.880]   You don't wanna stay here anyways.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.460]   This is a broken world, and Paul says,
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.100]   let that push you towards hope.
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.680]   And while you wait, be filled with hope.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.740]   And not only hope, he also tells us,
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:37.560]   while we wait, there's something else that we have.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.560]   Verse 26, in the same way that we wait with hope,
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.680]   the Spirit helps us in our weakness.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.460]   For we do not know what we ought to pray for.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.040]   So he gives an example, he says,
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.520]   look, in the same way that you wait with hope,
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.700]   you also, if you're a follower of Jesus,
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.640]   you wait with someone.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.720]   The Spirit, the Holy Spirit, waits with you,
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.200]   and he's there to be a helper, help you in our weakness.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.160]   And one of the ways he helps us is even through prayer.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.400]   For we do not know what we ought to pray for,
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.380]   but the Spirit himself intercedes with us
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.580]   through wordless groans.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.520]   And he who searches our hearts, that's God,
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.560]   knows the mind of the Spirit,
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.640]   because the Spirit intercedes for God's people
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.160]   in accordance with the will of God.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.940]   This brings us to our third idea.
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.420]   So we have the source of our greatest hurt is sin.
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.040]   The source of our greatest hope is the resurrection,
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.680]   and gosh, it's coming.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.560]   And the source of our greatest help while we wait
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.120]   is the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.840]   That the Holy Spirit, God says,
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.640]   "Not only am I gonna give my life for you on the cross,"
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:52.400]   it's so huge, "I'm going to give my spirit to you
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.320]   "while you wait."
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.840]   Not only am I gonna give my life, Jesus,
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.360]   God says to you to be to humanity,
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.600]   "Not only will I give my life for you on the cross,
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.460]   "I'm going to give my spirit to you while you wait.
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:06.780]   "I will not leave you alone.
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.440]   "I'm not just gonna die, and I'll see you later.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.120]   "Peace out, I'll be back.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.960]   "That I'm going to leave my spirit with you
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.780]   "while we wait for the resurrection to fully take place
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.160]   "and to be fully revealed."
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.680]   That Paul just said, "God stays with us,
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.400]   "helps us in the meantime."
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:25.240]   One of the ways he helps us is even through prayer.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.560]   Did you see that in the text?
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.200]   He says, "Look, even the spirit helps us,"
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.240]   and he gives one example.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.620]   His point is that the spirit's with you,
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.320]   that while we wait, 'cause Paul just went
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.440]   from the past to the future,
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.160]   and then we got this huge middle section,
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.960]   which is where we are.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.320]   So it's gonna be amazing someday.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.200]   What about now, Paul?
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.020]   Paul says, "Even now, while you wait, God is with you."
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:49.140]   And he says, "One of the ways that he's here to help you
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.380]   "or he's helping you is even in your prayer life,
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.880]   "you're not a good prayer, I'm not a good prayer."
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.060]   And he says, "Even the spirit helps with prayer."
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.940]   That in other words, you pray things and I pray things.
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.440]   I think we could all probably admit,
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.980]   yeah, there are things I'm glad God
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.280]   did not answer that prayer.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.880]   I would've been married to Becky, and Becky's crazy.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.560]   And, or whatever it is, we all have things
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.640]   we look back and like, man, God, you are so at work,
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.080]   and I'm so glad.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.120]   That's what the Bible just said,
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.600]   that the spirit, that as believers,
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.880]   sometimes because we're weak, because we can't see
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.960]   all that God can see, we'll pray things,
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.200]   and it's like the Holy Spirit catches it,
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.900]   and he's like, we are not answering this.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:25.640]   I'm gonna upgrade to what really is the best thing for him,
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.000]   and he takes something else and says,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:27.840]   God, give him this.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.520]   This is in accordance with your will.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.120]   Because he doesn't know what I know,
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.880]   and I know he asked for this, but there's something better,
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.200]   and so I want you to give him this.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.840]   That's what the spirit of God does for us.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.240]   It's not dissimilar to this past weekend.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.680]   I was at a wedding, and anytime I have a friend
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.240]   who gets married, I have been told from another friend
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.900]   who works at a hotel industry that, hey,
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:51.620]   if you will call the hotel, and it's someone's wedding night,
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:53.600]   this is just free tip for everybody.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.700]   Keep it our secret, though.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.440]   If you'll just call the hotel and ask them,
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.480]   say, hey, it's my friend's wedding,
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.120]   they will upgrade them for free.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.800]   So anytime I have a friend that gets married,
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.320]   I will call the hotel, if I know that the hotel
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.840]   they're staying at, and say, hey, will you upgrade them?
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.680]   So I did it here.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.240]   I called, I said, hey, what room?
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.240]   His name was Cody.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.500]   What room is he staying in?
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.400]   Oh, he's staying in the standard room.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.220]   Oh, that's great.
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.300]   Hey, will you upgrade him?
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.320]   I know that he asked for that room,
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.140]   but he doesn't know what I know.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.560]   I know that you will upgrade him,
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.980]   'cause you're great people.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.280]   Will you upgrade him to a higher-level room?
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.600]   And they said, yes, done.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.360]   Then in the same way, I know he asked for that,
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.580]   but there's something better.
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.720]   He doesn't know what I know.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.600]   The spirit of God says to you and to me,
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.280]   even in our prayers, he said, I'm gonna help.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.040]   I'm gonna give you an upgrade to something better,
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.680]   'cause you don't see what I see.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.480]   You don't know what I know.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.120]   And even in our prayers, he helps us.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.000]   This verse, side note quickly, has been used
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   to really encourage this weird teaching on tongues,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.520]   on private prayer language.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.120]   That's not what Paul's saying here,
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.520]   and even if there was a case to be made for that,
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.460]   it wouldn't be from here.
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.280]   He's using it 'cause it's like groans.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.360]   Maybe that's what he's saying,
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.920]   this ecstatic speech.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:09.280]   He doesn't say he groans, the spirit of God groans in us.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.520]   He says for us.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.920]   And not only that, groans is like an alliteration
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:14.760]   Paul is using.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.080]   If Paul was here, he wouldn't be like,
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.000]   I'm not talking about groans, ecstatic speech.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.240]   I'm talking about, I said creation groans,
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.720]   we groan, the spirit groans.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.760]   It kinda works together.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:23.600]   That was his point.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.700]   He used those three things.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.600]   It wasn't some sort of private prayer language
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.900]   that he was teaching here.
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:34.500]   The point he was trying to make is that God is with us.
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:38.700]   He helps us in the meantime,
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.880]   that as we wait and the resurrection is coming,
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.180]   man, I hope that nothing else.
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.980]   This is a message that it's less like,
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.420]   hey, what to do, and less like,
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.080]   hey, you gotta stop going to club on the weekend,
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.140]   and more like, hey, I just wanna lay a foundation
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.140]   so that in your mind, you understand what's coming.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.820]   This is a more, not what to do, what to know.
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.700]   How to understand what the Bible says,
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.000]   what we're headed towards,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.660]   what eternity's going to be like.
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.900]   The point Paul ends with here is that
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:06.980]   here's what you gotta know.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.100]   God is with you.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.060]   While you wait, he will not leave.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.640]   He's holding onto you.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.180]   God did not just give his life for us on the cross.
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.820]   He gives his spirit to us while we wait,
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.220]   and he's going to help walk with his spirit,
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:24.100]   depend on his spirit, and know that the spirit of God,
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.380]   you may try to let go of it.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:29.380]   It will not let go of you if you've accepted Jesus.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.380]   It's going to wait, and it's going to see you through
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.620]   to eternity, to the resurrection.
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.740]   I'll close with this.
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:42.520]   When my wife gave birth to our son,
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.540]   we got to the hospital on that day.
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.420]   It was kind of like an emergency C-section day,
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:53.660]   'cause his size was off.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.660]   Everything was fine, but we basically found out,
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.820]   oh, we gotta get him out of there.
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.180]   We went to the hospital, we checked in,
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.340]   and they put us in this room.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.100]   And then they wheeled us in the new hospital gowns,
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.220]   and they put us in this different room,
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:08.300]   and they began to hook all these kinds of weird things
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.420]   up to my wife, which was an interesting experience.
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:13.940]   I'm sitting there, and they're about to perform surgery,
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:18.300]   and I'm waiting as she begins to give birth to our son.
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.900]   I'm holding her hand, and I begin to hear her,
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.740]   and she's squeezing tightly, and I can tell
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.540]   that she gets anxious.
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:26.900]   Throughout while we were waiting, she was like,
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.660]   "You're going to stay with me in there, right?"
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.880]   Even when, at one point, they separated us from the room
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.260]   right before they got started, she got anxious
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:39.060]   because she didn't have her husband there with her,
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.220]   'cause how awesome I am, that's not a dull lie.
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.940]   Because, of course, like, oh my gosh,
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:43.780]   they're about to cut me open.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.180]   Can I at least hold someone's hand?
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.860]   And so, of course, I stayed with her.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.100]   I made sure I was in there.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.860]   Came in early, held her hand,
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.660]   and stayed with her the whole time.
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:55.060]   And do you know what never happened during that process?
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.780]   Like, there was never one moment where I was like,
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:57.900]   "You know what?
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:58.860]   "I'm gonna stop holding your hand.
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.320]   "I'm gonna go get some of the snack machine.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.240]   "Good luck in here.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.080]   "Let me know how it goes.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.600]   "Somebody take pictures for me while I'm gone,
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.440]   "if you don't mind."
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.260]   It never happened.
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.220]   I'm not going anywhere.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.240]   Even despite the pain that she's going through,
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.380]   all that I felt was, man, I wish I could even
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.700]   take away this pain.
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.740]   And I'm not going anywhere.
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:17.180]   I'm staying right here.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.660]   And even when the moments came where she would let go
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.560]   of my hand because of the pain,
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.600]   I didn't let go of hers.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.740]   I wasn't letting go.
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:30.980]   That is what the Spirit of God does to believers in Christ.
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:34.820]   In this world, he says, "I will not let you go.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.540]   "I will stay with you in your weakness.
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.260]   "You're weak, but I'm not leaving you.
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.780]   "I will see you through to the new world.
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.580]   "And you can let go of me at times 'cause of the pain,
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.160]   "but I will never let go of you.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.040]   "You are not getting away from me.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.660]   "You cannot shake God off if you have accepted in Christ."
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.340]   And he says that to all of us.
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:57.980]   I am staying with you.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:01.740]   If an imperfect husband wouldn't walk away
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.220]   or get distracted and be like, hey, good luck in there,
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:08.100]   how much more the Spirit of God who says,
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.920]   "I will die in your place.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.980]   "I will take the pain for you."
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:16.340]   How much more will he stay and say,
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.460]   "I am holding on and not letting go.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:23.440]   "And I know it hurts, but it's gonna be over soon.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:30.180]   "And let it fill you with hope of what is to come.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.060]   "And I will not leave you.
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.900]   "And I will not let go of you.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.420]   "And I love you."
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.100]   And he said that to all of us.
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:42.260]   And if you're a follower of Jesus, that is true of you.
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.820]   And you're gonna rise again.
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.960]   Death is dying.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.980]   And you're gonna live forever.
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.480]   The world we live in will live forever.
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:58.140]   Because God will dwell with his people
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.180]   on this earth made new.
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.960]   And until that day comes, the Spirit says,
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.740]   "I'll never leave you."
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.460]   Let me pray that we believe that.
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:16.020]   Father, you are everything that we long for.
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:23.380]   Everything that we yearn for is being restored
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.940]   back to a relationship with you, our God.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.020]   All peace comes from you.
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.660]   All life comes from you.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.100]   All order is restored.
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.780]   Cancer is stopped.
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.340]   Chaos is stopped.
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:38.620]   Death, racism, disease, they will all end
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:41.180]   once we establish and get back in full relationship
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:44.860]   with you when the resurrection that took place
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:48.220]   with Jesus on Easter takes place
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.840]   with all those who know you.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.540]   And we rise again.
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.660]   Our world rises again.
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:58.180]   We long for you and now we walk in relationship with you
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:01.860]   and thank you that you have left your Spirit here
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.620]   to allow us to experience the first tastes
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.460]   of the future kingdom, the future world,
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.420]   even while we wait.
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:15.000]   And Lord, would we wait, not putting our hope here,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.460]   but in what is to come in you.
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:24.740]   We love you and we yearn for you
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.940]   and we worship you through song now, amen.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:31.220]   One of the things in that message that I like wrestling with
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:33.100]   is I know in this room there are a lot of people
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.860]   who are suffering is not some idea.
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.500]   It's your world right now.
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:43.260]   And like my heart breaks and even that message
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.420]   is less like, hey, just tough it out,
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:46.500]   we're getting through it.
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.500]   Because also inside of the New Testament,
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.040]   we find examples of like, hey, mourn with those who mourn.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.820]   And we're not telling you if you're walking through that,
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.660]   just tough it out and pull your bootstraps.
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:58.900]   We'll mourn with you.
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.020]   Come down, we'll have a whole team cry, hug, listen.
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:06.940]   And I know that Jesus mourns with you.
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.420]   A world that was never meant to be this way.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.780]   There's a story that like messes with my mind
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:15.420]   and I don't understand it,
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.900]   of Jesus coming to the grave
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.840]   of a good friend of his named Lazarus.
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.940]   And he walks up to the grave
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:23.580]   and Lazarus, his good friend, he just died.
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.900]   It was two days ago when he died and he shows up.
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:30.140]   And Jesus is about to heal him.
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.680]   He's about to say, hey, Lazarus,
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:33.900]   get up and come out.
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.780]   And he walks up to the funeral
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:39.420]   and he sees everyone weeping around
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:42.100]   and Jesus begins to weep.
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.340]   Why are you weeping?
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:47.000]   You're about to call him out, why are you weeping?
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.500]   Because he's not some God who's standing there saying,
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.380]   tough it out, come out.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.940]   He moves towards his people.
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:58.860]   He knows the pain that they feel
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:00.580]   even more than they know it.
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.320]   If you're in the midst of suffering,
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.440]   he mourns with you the pain of a world
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.600]   that was never meant to be this way.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.960]   That's why I think he mourns.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.480]   If anyone knows humanity,
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:17.680]   creation was never meant to taste death.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.080]   It was not supposed to be this way.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.480]   It's the creator.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.400]   And so if you're in that place right now
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.080]   and I didn't communicate that well,
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.160]   please forgive me.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.320]   I know that you would feel the love of Jesus
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.240]   if you was here.
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.140]   And I know that the pain you're walking through
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.500]   grieves the heart of God.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:41.020]   If you have never placed your faith in Jesus
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:43.380]   as the payment for your sin,
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:45.520]   I know that that grieves the heart of God
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.160]   because the message for all people,
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.180]   if you're here for the first time or the 50th time
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.420]   and you're like, I don't know where I stand with God,
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:56.080]   you need to know that Christianity's not about being good.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.300]   Could God accept me?
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.460]   You know, that's nice, new world.
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:00.480]   Will I be a part of it?
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.160]   Not that good here, done some bad things.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.080]   Today, I did some bad things.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.600]   Christianity's about accepting the fact
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.300]   that you cannot be good enough to get to God.
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:16.640]   But he came to earth and died for you in your place.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.880]   That's what Christianity's about.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.300]   And if you've never trusted in that,
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:21.880]   you won't be in the new world.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:27.360]   But the offer still stands in this world
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.520]   for you to receive that and accept that.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.080]   We're gonna have an entire team down here.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.640]   If we can answer questions you're wrestling through,
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.800]   talk to you, pray for you.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.280]   If you're mourning or you're just going
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:41.560]   through a hard time, we'd love to pray with you.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:45.200]   There's a class we do every once in a while
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.160]   called Next Steps.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.360]   If you're looking to connect around here,
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.200]   to plug in around here, we want this place to feel small
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.080]   for you to have relationships, be connected here.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.560]   You may be wondering, what is Watermark
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.040]   or what does the porch have going on?
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.040]   How can I get plugged in?
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.080]   We do a class called Next Steps for you.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.800]   And so tonight is that class.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.480]   Right after here, you'll have a chance to hear
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.560]   from some of our friends up in the loft,
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.480]   which is just the room right outside these doors,
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.240]   one floor up, you'll see loft.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.160]   Go right up there, you can hear about everything
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.540]   that's going on, learn about connecting here.
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:15.800]   We love you guys.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.760]   You guys go in peace to love and serve the Lord this week.
