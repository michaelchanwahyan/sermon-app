[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [Music]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   [Music]
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   [Music]
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   [Music]
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   [Music]
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Well, all right. We're going to do tonight's message in the dark.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   My name is David Marvin. I'm excited to be back with you guys.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   I will start off this evening with kind of a story that will shape where we're going.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   When I was in college, when I was 20 years old, some friends and I planned a summer month
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   that we were going to take and go work in an orphanage in Africa, specifically Uganda.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   And so we decided, hey, we're going to go do this. It's going to be amazing.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And so we spent the better part of our sophomore year at that time planning out this trip
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   where we found a place to go, a place to stay. We bought tickets.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   We had everything arranged and thought. We had thought through everything really by March.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And the trip was in July. And so March comes and this is awesome. Everything's planned and ready.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And I realized I'd forgot one critical component, a passport.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   That I didn't have a passport. I know it's funny, but I just hadn't been out of the country or to Mexico,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   or other than Mexico. And so I needed to get a passport. So I look online.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   It says take six to 12 weeks, which is great because I got four months. I got 16 weeks.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   So this is perfect. I fill everything out and I send it off to get a passport.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And so I go that summer and I go work at a camp in Missouri and I'm from Houston.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And so I go up and I'm calling every now and then to see, hey, when is the passport?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Has the passport come? Has it arrived yet? And so six weeks go by, nothing.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   12 weeks go by, nothing. And all of a sudden I'm a month out and I'm going,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   oh my gosh, what am I going to do about this passport?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   So I'm now calling the bureau, which is an amazing experience, to get my passport
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   and trying to get a hold of someone who could tell me where it is. And they're saying it's in transit.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And I'm asking, can I overnight it? And they're saying, we don't really know where it is.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I'm like, go USA. So I am trying to get a hold of these things.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And all of a sudden we're three weeks out and two weeks out and I'm calling, where is it?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   One week out and it still has not arrived. And so five days from the trip, I decide
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I'm going to drive to Houston because at that time it was the closest one day passport place you could go to.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   So I'm going to go, I drive down on a Thursday. My flight is on Monday.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And so they're only open Monday to Friday. So I've got one day, Friday.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And so I wake up that morning, I go to the passport bureau, I get my picture taken
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   and I get there at 7.15, it opens at 8. And by the time I get there, there's already a line
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   outside of the building and wrapping around it. And so I'm going, oh my gosh, I'm in trouble.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And if you don't get it, if you don't finish the process by the end of the day,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I would have to wait until Monday. And so I wait and six hours later, I get my passport,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   which was awesome. And so big relief. And I go home and the next morning I wake up
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   and I start to pack and the mailman shows up with my other passport.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   So now I've got two and I'm like, this is awesome. Jason Bourne.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I've got two of these things and they're different numbers on the passport.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And they're totally different. Like they're different pictures.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   They're different numbers, like a passport number. I would think we'd have the same one.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   They're totally different. And so I'm like, this is great. And then it hits me.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   What if one of these doesn't work? What if only one of them works?
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   What if neither of them work? I mean, I can't really go to the airport and have them scan it in.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And if it doesn't work on that one, be like, here, just try this one.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I'm not a spy, I promise. Or going through security and holding my passport
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   and they see another one in my bag. That can't look good.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And so I'm going, what am I going to do? And friends are telling me competing ideas about,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   hey, both of them will work or just pick one of them, either of them will work.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And I'm looking on the internet and reading stories about people caught with two passports
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   and they confiscate both of them. And I'm going, oh my gosh, what am I going to do?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Which one of these will work and get me to my destination?
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And I tell you that story because in a lot of ways, that's the story as it relates to religion.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   In our culture, in our world, as people wondering, hey, which one of these will get me to my destination?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Will both of them, will all roads lead to God? Does only one of them lead to God?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Do none of them lead to God? What is the thing that will get me to the destination I want to go?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And so tonight, as we continue this series called Skeptical,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   where we're diving into the tough questions facing Christianity or questions that people have
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   as it relates to Christianity, we're going to explore what makes Christianity distinct
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   from every other world religion. And the Apostle Paul and the book of Acts,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   we're going to explore, is going to lay out what I think is the foundation,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   not only for the Christian faith, but it is the essential thing to understand
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   what you're rejecting if you want to reject Christianity or if you have rejected Christianity
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   and what sets it apart and in a different category from every other worldview and every other faith.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   So we're going to be in the book of Acts. If you have a Bible, you can put there,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, and we're going to be in chapter 17, and we're going to start in verse 16.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   The Apostle Paul is in Athens, the same Athens you can go visit today, and you can go see all the sites today.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And he is waiting for a couple of friends, and while he waits for these friends,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   he begins to engage and lay out what makes Christianity so different than their worldview.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   And Athens was a very pluralistic, very polytheistic, very believe in this.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   We're not really sure you have your own God. We have our own God.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And he lays out what makes Christianity so different.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Verse 16, while the Apostle Paul was waiting for them in Athens,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   So Paul walks into the city of Athens, this huge cultural hub,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   and this Palestinian Jew who's way far from home steps into a different world,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   and everywhere he looks, he sees all these different idols, shrines, statues to represent these different gods.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Here's what happens. So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews and God-fearing Greeks,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happen to be there.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   So Paul begins engaging. Hey, I see all these religious icons.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   I want to discuss a religious expression that I have.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   A group, verse 18, of Epicurean, which is a group that just believed,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   hey, do whatever you want, life is short, and nothing happens when you die.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And Stoic, who believed life is all about discipline, philosophers begin to debate him.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Some of them asked, what is this babbler trying to say?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And others remarked, he seems to be advocating foreign gods.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   So they think Paul is telling them about foreign deities,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   and he's coming in advocating for why these aren't the gods, but there's these foreign gods.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   He continues, as he's telling them about Jesus and his resurrection,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   that God sent his son into the world, who died on a cross and came back to life.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   He continues, then they took him and brought him to the meeting of the Areopagus.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   So Paul creates such a stir in the marketplace, which was the center of Athens.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   There was no news, no internet. This is where you went to buy things.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   It's where you went to go get food. It's where you went to go hear news and hear teaching.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And so Paul creates such a stir that they take him to the Areopagus.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Areopagus means nothing to us, but the Areopagus, if you study philosophy, is a really famous place.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   It's the place where Plato taught, where Socrates taught, where Aristotle taught.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   It was the hub, within the hub, of the philosophical world.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   It was the birthplace of philosophy, was the Areopagus.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   And so Paul is brought before the council of the Areopagus,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   where they want to hear what he's proclaiming. Here's what he says.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   "Where they said to him, 'May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting.'"
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Verse 20. "You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we would like to know what they mean."
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Because they were not used to a monotheistic, God loves the world, God sent his son, there's one God.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   They were used to all kinds of different gods, and Paul's proposing an entirely different worldview.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   "All the Athenians," I love that this is in here, verse 21.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   "All the Athenians and foreigners who live there spent their time doing nothing but talking and listening about the latest ideas."
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Verse 22. "Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus, and he said, 'People of Athens,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   I see that in every way you are very religious. For as I walked around the city, I looked carefully at your objects of worship.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Everywhere I looked, I saw shrines, temples that still exist today, altars of these gods that they would worship.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And I even found an altar with this inscription, 'To an unknown God.'"
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   So Paul says, "Look, everywhere I looked, I saw all these different gods. In fact, I even saw one that said, 'To an unknown God.'"
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And what we know about history tells us about this unknown God statue,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   was it basically, it was the way the Athenians covered all their bases.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   That we think there's a God for this, and we think there's a God for this, and there's probably a God over here,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   and there's Zeus, and Thor, and Triton, and all these different things.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   But just in case we miss one, we're going to have one to the unknown God, in case that God ever shows up,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   and it's like, "Hey, I'm Bob. Where's my temple?"
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   And they're like, "Bob, we got yours. It was right, we didn't know your name, Bob. It's right here. This is your temple."
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And they could say, "Hey, this is the unknown God."
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And so what that tells us is, and this is so important, especially for our day and age,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   is the Athenians were very, very religious.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   They were aware there's a God out there, but they were not very certain.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   They didn't know exactly how all of this worked.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   They didn't know exactly how God would be pleased, and Paul's about to lay it out for them.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   "So you are ignorant of the very thing you worship, and this is what I'm going to proclaim to you."
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   So Paul says, "There's uncertainty, there's a gap, and I want to talk about that.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   You are doing a bunch of religious things, wondering what God wants from you,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   wondering if you and God or the gods can be okay,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   wondering if you've done enough, wondering if you've done too much,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   wondering who's out there."
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And he says, "I want to proclaim to you, because God who is there wants to be known," he says.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And some of us, this idea of being ignorant of the thing that we worship,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   is really not that far from our culture today,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   where some of us in this room are ignorant of the thing or things that we worship.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   70% of Americans believe that all roads lead to God,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   that many faiths can lead to God, according to a 2011 Gallup poll.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   And this is so crazy, because there's such contradictory claims, and you may not realize this.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   There's contradictory claims that are inherent to each of them,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   and yet everyone would say they basically all teach the same thing,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   which is an expression of ignorance.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Here's what we know.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Here's what Islam says, as it relates to exclusively Islam or Muslims.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   It's from the Quran.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   "Whoever prefers a religion other than Islam, it shall definitely not be accepted from him,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   and in the hereafter, he shall be among the losers."
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   I'm not totally sure what that means, but it doesn't sound good.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Hinduism. "Those who are without faith in my teaching cannot attain Krishna, enlightenment.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I permeate all the universe in my unmanifest form.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   All beings exist within me.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   If you do not accept this view, you will never achieve Hindu salvation."
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Buddhism. "This is the only path.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   There is no other for the purification of insight.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Walking upon this path, you will make an end of suffering."
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   In the Jewish tradition, exclusivity manifests itself in the concept of God's chosen people.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   So every major world religion, every way that you look, all of them make exclusive claims.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   That's one thing that's not different about Christianity,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   and the idea that all of them basically teach the same thing
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   is to really express you're ignorant of what all of them teach.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   And I mean that as kindly as I can, because all of them make exclusive claims.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   But there's something different and distinct about the Christian message.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Paul's about to lay it out for us.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   In the past, verse 30. Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Here we go. Verse 24.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   "The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   and he does not live in temples built by human hands."
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   So he said, lesson number one, God is bigger than all of your temples.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   God is bigger than your religion. He continues.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   "And he is not served by human hands as if he needed anything.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Rather, he himself gives life and breath and everything else."
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   And Paul says, here's the problem with your religion.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Here's the problem with all religions.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   It puts God in a box.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   It infers that God needs to be served. God needs us to do things.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   And Paul says, the God who made all that is is not served by human hands.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   He's not served by good deeds.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   He's not served in a way that makes you right with him by sacraments.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   He's not served by praying five times, by visiting Mecca.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   He says, your God, you Athenians have made him too small.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   The God who is there is bigger than your religion.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   He's bigger than your temple. He's bigger than all your religious expressions.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   And he's not served by human hands.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Rather, he has stepped into the world and has become a servant for all.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   The God who exists and who is unknown to you has made himself known
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   and desires for all people to know him. And he's going to lay out how.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   "From one man," verse 26,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   "he made all the nations that they should inhabit the whole earth,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   and he marked out their appointed times and history and the boundaries of their land."
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   So God ordained everything.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   "God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find them."
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   I love this.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   "Though he is not far from any of them," any of us,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   that God did this, that's what religion is, isn't it?
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Where you seek out and you reach out and you try to reach God,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   you try to approach God, and he says,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   "All over the world, people have been seeking and reaching."
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And here's the reality, they're reaching in the wrong direction.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   They're reaching in the wrong way because God is not far from any of them.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   He's not beyond their reach.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   But he has reached into our world, as he's going to lay out, through a person.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Verse 28, "For in him we live and move and have our being,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   as some of your own poets have said, 'We are his offspring.'"
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   So he quotes these two Greek poets.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   It'd be like quoting Eminem today, where it's like, "Vomit on his sweater already."
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   It would not be like quoting Eminem in this crowd, apparently.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   But it'd be like quoting someone that everyone knew, and he says,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   "Look, you guys know this. You know that the God who's out there is not served by human hands.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   In fact, you know that the God who's out there is not these little statues.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   He's not that statue. He's not this shrine.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Because here's what you know. You've heard this before.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Your own poets say, 'The God who's out there made us. We are his offspring.'"
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Is it really that crazy?
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Or isn't it a little crazy to think that if we're God's offspring,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   we can make and fashion our own God, as he says in the next verse?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   "Therefore, since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   is like gold or silver or stone or an image made by human design or skill."
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   And he's pointing to all these different images.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   And to us, this seems silly today, that someone would make a God,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   and they would think that is their God, and they would worship that God,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   and they would believe in that God.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   But this happens all the time.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   This is one of the most popular beliefs in our country.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Here's what I mean.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   People all the time, one of the most common answers that I hear
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   is the idea that all faiths lead to God because God is loving.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And I always ask, where does that belief come from?
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   You may have heard this before. You may have a family member.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   I probably guarantee you have a family member that would say,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   "Yeah, all faiths. I believe God's love, and so he accepts everyone.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   All faiths ultimately lead to him."
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Where does that idea come from?
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Think about that.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   God is loving, so he accepts everyone.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Where does that come from?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Islam doesn't teach that.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Hinduism doesn't teach that.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Buddhism doesn't teach that. It doesn't teach there is a God.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   That comes from the Bible.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   What else does the Bible say?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   That the God who is loving has provided the way for anyone on earth
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   and anyone who's ever lived to have eternal life by trusting in Jesus alone.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Well, I don't believe in the Bible.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Then you've made up your God of love.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   And I don't have enough faith to believe in a God of love
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   that I just made up with no basis.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   And I just hope I have fashioned by human design and intellect.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   It's everywhere.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   God's that have been made up.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   In the past, as in something new has happened,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   verse 30, "God overlooked such ignorance,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   but now he commands all people everywhere to repent."
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And repent is kind of a hard word, because in church we think,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   "Stop the evil deeds!"
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   But it's really the word that means, "Change your minds."
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   That God has stepped on to human history
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   and stepped into our world in such a way,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   and now he's done something new, and in light of it,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   he commands everyone everywhere to change their minds
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   about how they see and relate to him or think of him.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   "For he has set a day," I love this, and this is the thing,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   "where he will judge the world with justice."
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   In other words, everyone is accountable.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   "By the man he has appointed," talking about Jesus, we're going to see,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   "and he has given proof of this to everyone
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   by raising him from the dead."
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   So Paul says, "Hey, look, the Athenians, the good news is
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   you're trying, you're reaching out, you're religious,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   you are aware that there's something out there.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   The bad news is you're not exactly sure how this works,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   and here's what I want you to know.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   The unknown God to you has desired to make himself known
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   in an undeniable way, and he did it by sending his son
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   into the world so that no one would have to live
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   with the question of where do I stand with God,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   with uncertainty about where am I in my relationship with God.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Have I done enough good things that we know will never get us
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   towards the mountain of God if he is perfect?"
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   And he says, "The good news is, Athenians, God has done something,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   and he's reached into human history, and he's risen from the dead.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   He came, he died on a cross to pay for anyone's sin,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   and he came back to life to prove it."
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   And I love this idea because it's so easy, church world,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   it's so easy to just get religious and to get like pews
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   and steeples and open up and there's the peoples
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   and all the different things that--
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   You guys, more of you knew that than I thought would.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   And all the different things that we can just clutter.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   But when Christianity was born, and maybe you've never heard this,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   and so if you miss everything else,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   when Christianity was launched,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   when the movement began, it wasn't about religion.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   It wasn't about rituals.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   It was about the God who is there, who desired to make himself known,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   and he reached down into human history, and he came,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   and he died on a cross, and he came back to life,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   and everywhere his followers went,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   they didn't say, "You should love your neighbor as you love yourself."
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   They said, "We saw a man die, and he came back to life.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   He claimed to be God, and he said anyone who places their trust
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   for their sins, for their mistakes, past and future,
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   on him, and not on themselves,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   not on their ability to do good things, will have eternal life,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   will be extended forgiveness."
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   That it wasn't good people who go to heaven,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   and bad people who go to hell, but forgiven people.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   And forgiveness always heals a relationship.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   You know that in your own relationships when they break.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   You have to have forgiveness to heal it,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   and God has said through the person of Jesus,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   the only means by which you can experience a healed relationship
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   is not by trying to do good things as if those serve me,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   but by accepting the free gift I'm offering to anyone who's willing
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   to say, "I can't be good enough.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   I'm trusting in the only one who was good.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   I don't need a second chance to keep more rules or a redo.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   I need a savior."
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   And this was the thing that launched Christianity
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   out of the first century, and you have to do something with it.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Because here's what's undeniable.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   2,000 years ago, something happened.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   It's undeniable.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   What's undeniable is that a man named Jesus,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   who was born and lived in Galilee,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   who was a Jewish peasant raised by a carpenter,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   a man we never should have heard about,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   a man who said crazy, insane asylum things like,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   "I am God," before the world existed.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   "I am."
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   And he also said, "I am the only way to eternal life."
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   And he said, "I will die on a cross for the sins of all humanity
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   because every religion cannot meet the righteous requirement God requires."
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   But God is not far and has stepped into human history
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   to provide the only means of having a relationship with him.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   What's undeniable is that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   went to their death, his followers,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   not for what they said they believed in,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   not for, "Hey, we believe that you should go with a man a mile
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   if he asks you to go a mile," and turn the other cheek.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   They went to their death for what they believed they saw.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   I saw a man die and he came back to life.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   People go to their death all the time for what they believe.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Terrorists fly into buildings with planes because of what they believe.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   They went to their deaths for what they said they saw.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   What's undeniable is that a man you never should have heard about,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   a place that you can't point on the map,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   has somehow caught the attention and the belief in 2 billion people
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   in a religion that is exploding Christianity all over this world,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   believe he's the son of God,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   the only means by which we can have right standing with God.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   What's undeniable is that the God who did not want to be unknown
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   but wanted to be known,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   stepped onto history and today you dated your calendar
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   on his birth of the undeniable mark of the God who wanted to be known.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   This is the thing that sets it apart from every other world religion
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   because it's not about what you do, Jesus says.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   It's about trusting in what I have done.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   This is one of the biggest obstacles.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   When people come down up front afterwards and our team will discuss,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   what people don't understand what the good news is, was,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   and always has been intended to be.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Religion, here's how I wrote in my notes.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Religion, every religion, says what is God
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   or what is the force of the universe want from us?
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Christianity says, look at what God has done for us.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Religion says, what kind of sacrifice does God want?
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Christianity says, look at the sacrifice God has given us.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   It's not about who is right, it's about who is Jesus.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   And when you date your calendar tomorrow,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   that's the only question that matters.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   But something happened and you can't wish it away,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   you got to deal with it.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   I think it's so easy from my own heart to see Christianity
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   and to see God as just another religion,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   that there's some God out there who wants me to do certain things
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   and then he'll be finally happy with me or some future version of me.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Not that he loves me now, forever, perfectly,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   and you and all of our sin and all of our brokenness.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Now, right where you are.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   That he's not a God who wants you to work your way to him,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   he has come to you and shown his love
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   in a way that is distinct from any other worldview.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Now, I'm going to read a verse and I just want you to think about these verses.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   You've probably read these verses or heard them hundreds of times.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   But I just want you to think about the world in which these words were written
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   and in which the readers and hearers of them first heard.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   In the Greek world, the Roman and the Jewish world,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   a world where the gods, men would play things to the gods.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   They didn't care about them at all.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   John 3, 16 and 17.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   For God so loved the world that he was moved in love,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   not for just a group of people, but for the entire world,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   for all people, everywhere.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   This is why the message of Jesus at his birth was proclaimed.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   This is good news of great joy for all people of every race,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   of every place and every tribe.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   That it wasn't just when Jesus left the earth,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   he didn't get his followers to get in and go,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   "Hey, let's just go to the Jews. I'm a Jew. You're a Jew.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Give me a J, give me an E, give me a W. We'll go to the Jews."
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   He said, "This is for all people. Go to the ends of the earth."
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Because my father has sent me out of his expression of love.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   And out of that expression, he gave his one and only son
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   that whoever believes or puts their trust in him
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   will not perish, but have eternal life.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   For God did not send his son into the world to condemn it,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   but to save it.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   I'm gonna fall short of what I'm gonna try to do.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   The amount that God loves you
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   and was willing to sacrifice for all people
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   because he knew a religious system, a philosophy, a teaching
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   could not bridge the gap.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   The amount that he was willing to give up,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   I can't even begin to put into words,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   largely because I'm not sure that I fully even understand it
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   and comprehend it, of a perfect God and a perfect son
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   and a father who would give away his only child.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   You watch this video.

[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   - I've seen that movie like three times today,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   and I feel like every time, it's still like,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   it turned my eyes away.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   But that's what makes it distinct.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   And that video breaks down,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   and it doesn't even show perfectly
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   how much the Father loves and sacrificed
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   for not a train, but a world full of people
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   who wouldn't receive Him,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   who didn't accept Him.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   And what makes Christianity different
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   is that it tells the story of a God who loved the world,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   who was there, who changed the calendar,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   who stepped into that world
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   and died for all of your junk,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   all of my sin,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   all of the times I choose me above Him.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   And you can spend the rest of your life
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   trying to work towards Him,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   but He's already said that the only way
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   to deal with sin is through Him.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Good things don't do away with bad deeds,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   we know that.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   And for anyone who will take their trust
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   off of themself and put it onto Him,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   they'll receive forgiveness
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   and right relationship with God
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   who doesn't want to be unknown
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   and has undeniably made His mark known
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   for you and I to know Him.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   I'm gonna pray that we would
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   and that we would share it.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Father, I can't even begin to understand
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   how much you love me
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   and you gave and you give
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   and you love my friends in the room
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   more than they'll ever know.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   We thank you for the cross,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   we thank you for your son who died for our sins,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   who died for every person
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   who was refused and rejected
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   and that you love us right now
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   just where we are in all of our mess.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   You offer us a new life, an eternal life.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   I pray that we would walk in that
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   and that we would accept that if we haven't, amen.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Amen.
