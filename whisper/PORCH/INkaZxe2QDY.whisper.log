[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.900]   - Let's go 2019.
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.360]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.280]   Come on man.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.560]   Yeah, 2019 looks good on y'all, okay.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.520]   Hey, we're starting a new series tonight called Self Care.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.460]   We could not be more excited about this series
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.760]   as we dive into a very popular term
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.020]   and culture right now of self care.
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.400]   My most recent experience with the new form of self care
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.200]   is related to something called the chiropractor.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.240]   I don't know, anybody chiropractic people out there?
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.800]   Anyone over the age of 30 something?
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.260]   I had some like back pain recently
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.240]   and a friend was like, oh dude,
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.760]   you gotta go check out the chiropractor.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.640]   So went to the chiropractor with kind of fear
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.000]   and trepidation of like what sort of witch of indoor
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.160]   witch doctor am I about to walk into right now?
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.800]   Because the spine feels like a pretty valuable
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.060]   component of the body.
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.320]   If you're gonna lose a finger, that's one thing.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.800]   If you're gonna be forfeiting something with the spine,
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.440]   that feels like a bigger deal.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.920]   So I kind of go in there and basically was like,
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.540]   hey, can we not touch the neck?
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.600]   I've heard that can kill ya.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.280]   And so they went through it and I went a couple times
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.360]   and dude, and it worked.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.800]   I was like, I stand before you a healed man.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.640]   I tell you that.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.480]   [congregation laughing]
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.760]   And so that was kind of the most recent self-care.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.120]   But dude, I love self-care.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.800]   I'm a fan and I'm not just a fan.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.420]   Like I'm a fad self-care person.
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.200]   Like I kind of go from one fad to the next along with it
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.360]   of like, oh man, yeah, this is gonna work this time.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.000]   Whether it's like, you guys remember P90X?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.120]   Anybody do P90X?
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.400]   [congregation laughing]
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.680]   That guy was so creepy.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.760]   To Insanity and Shanti or CrossFit, any CrossFit people?
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.640]   [congregation cheering]
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.320]   You guys are all eating kale and doing deadlifts together.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.200]   Or just intermittent fasting is like a new thing.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.400]   I feel like I'm always down to try something new
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.600]   that kind of comes along.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.360]   Advocare, anybody remember or do Advocare?
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.680]   Yeah, I tried it.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.060]   I can never remember to take the vitamins.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.200]   I just like would buy them and then throw,
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.200]   it was basically like putting money down the toilet.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.920]   But here's the truth.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.600]   I'm not the only person who loves self-care.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.560]   Like our world is filled, we love self-care.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.600]   And there's no time of the year that we as a society
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.480]   are more into self-care than really
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.880]   the beginning of the year.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.600]   Where New Year's resolutions are rolling out
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.800]   and people are going back to the gym
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.640]   and you got all these kinds of different goals for 2019.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.160]   So I don't know what self-care looks like for you,
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.600]   but our society is really all about it.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.240]   Even that term of, hey, self-care,
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.880]   whether it's staycations or hey,
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.160]   it's an excuse to go to the spa or join a yoga class
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.880]   or fast pass, any fast pass people in here
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.800]   or bar classes or class pass, not fast pass,
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.520]   that's Disney World, class pass.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.900]   Or getting your nails done or just taking a vacation
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.480]   or retail therapy.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.280]   Any retail therapists in here under the banner
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.100]   of treat yourself?
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.100]   Here's my favorite thing about self-care though.
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.500]   If you've heard the expression,
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.060]   which is just something in culture,
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.020]   it's like it's a virtuous way to do all the things
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.420]   you wanna do anyways.
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.380]   You thought about this?
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.600]   It's like, yeah, I'm sorry, I have to break my commitment
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.840]   and stay home and put cucumbers on my eyes
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.160]   because if I don't care of me, take care of me,
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.000]   I can't take care of you.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.800]   So this, you're welcome, really, is what this is all about.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.980]   I feel like I need this massage right now
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.440]   because if I don't get it, I'm cranky.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.640]   If I don't sleep at least this amount,
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.320]   then I'm just not me.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.620]   And so it's like a new virtuous way
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.500]   to kinda do the things that we wanna do anyways.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.940]   But biblically speaking, that would be a little bit more
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.660]   like selfish care, if you will.
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.860]   But there are things that the Bible says
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.220]   we as followers of Jesus should have in our life
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.280]   to experience self-care.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.280]   Said another way, there is biblical self-care
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.140]   that the Bible lays out.
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.720]   And so for the next handful of weeks,
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.100]   we're gonna look at some of the teachings
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.780]   as it relates to scripture about how you can be
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.560]   a healthier you and experience a better self-care
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.640]   as it relates to your mind, body, soul, spirit,
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.860]   kinda rest in general.
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.120]   So we're gonna kick this off and hopefully,
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.720]   I think it's gonna be really, really helpful
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.560]   and we are excited.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.900]   But tonight, we are gonna dive into the starting point
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.080]   of self-care, that if you don't get this thing
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.180]   that we're gonna discuss tonight right,
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.080]   then any amount of yoga that you add to your regimen
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.680]   is just gonna be useless, or ultimately not gonna be
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.140]   meeting the greatest needs that you have.
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.720]   So tonight, we're gonna dive into the starting point
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.560]   of self-care.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.380]   If you take notes, you can write out
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.220]   the starting point of self-care.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.840]   We're gonna be in John chapter four
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.460]   and we're gonna look at an interaction that Jesus has
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.840]   with a lady and in it, he lays out three things
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.360]   that are crucial to your understanding,
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.000]   my understanding of self-care,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.020]   if you're gonna experience it at any point in your life
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.140]   and in 2019 this year.
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.880]   So in John chapter four, if you go to Bible,
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.900]   you can flip open there, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.120]   John was written by the apostle John,
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.300]   one of Jesus's best friends.
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.640]   And he lays out and writes this account
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.560]   of an interaction Jesus has with this woman
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.600]   and we're gonna pick it up in verse four.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.280]   You may have heard this story before,
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.100]   but some of the more profound truths
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.780]   that are contained really in the entire New Testament
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.160]   are recorded in this interaction that Jesus has.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.260]   We learned something about him, something about you,
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.560]   and something about self-care.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.640]   So we're gonna, three takeaways.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.040]   We'll start in verse four and go from there.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.980]   Now he, that's speaking of Jesus,
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.240]   had to go through Samaria.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.080]   Now let me pause.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.440]   Here's why this is significant, why John is including it.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.640]   So John is basically saying, hey, Jesus, starting out,
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.000]   he had to go through Samaria.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.840]   What was Samaria?
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.080]   Samaria was this area, I think we have a map that's up here,
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.180]   that no one, if you were a Jewish person,
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.600]   you never went through Samaria.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.960]   There was a phrase in that time that, hey,
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.100]   you would dust the sand off of your sandals
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.000]   if you got any of Samaria on you
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.220]   because it was an area that was filled
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.080]   with kind of former Jewish people
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.200]   that basically married a bunch of pagans
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.280]   and kind of blended all these different religions together.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.760]   So if you're in the Jewish areas,
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.800]   put it back up there, Billy,
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.320]   in the green on the top and the bottom,
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.480]   in order to get to any of these areas,
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.640]   you would go all the way,
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.680]   you wouldn't travel directly through,
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.060]   you'd go all the way around by the Jordan River
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.200]   because you wanted to avoid Samaria.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.120]   It was kind of a rough neighborhood, if you will.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.800]   Child sacrifice was a part of kind of cult worship there.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.900]   And so this was not a people that got along well
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.840]   with Jewish people, Samaritans and Jewish people.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.540]   And yet Jesus does what no one did in that day.
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.440]   And he says, I have to go through this area,
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.920]   and we're gonna discover why here in a second.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.340]   So when he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar,
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.280]   near the plot of the ground
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.360]   that Jacob had given his son Joseph,
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.600]   Jacob's well was there.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.200]   And Jesus, tired as he was from his journey,
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.560]   he sat down by the well, and it was noon.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.000]   So Jesus walking along, stops at this town,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.840]   there's a well, he sits down by the well, and it's noon.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.860]   When a Samaritan woman came to draw water,
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.440]   Jesus said to her, will you give me a drink?
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.560]   Because his disciples had gone into food to buy town.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.920]   The Samaritan woman said to him,
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.960]   you are a Jew, and I am a Samaritan woman.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.080]   How can you ask me for a drink?
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.800]   For Jews, John writes in parenthesis,
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.840]   do not associate with Samaritans.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.000]   And Jesus answered, and he says what only Jesus
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.700]   could get away with saying, if you knew the gift of God,
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.780]   and who it is that's asking you for a drink,
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.000]   you would have asked him,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.240]   and he would have given you living water.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.480]   I say this because, ladies, if a guy ever interacts with you
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.840]   as it relates to a question and says,
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.220]   if you knew the gift of God,
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.880]   standing in front, like only Jesus can say this type of thing
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.180]   because he's Jesus, he is the gift of God.
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.040]   And for God so loved the world, he gave.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.360]   And so Jesus says, if you knew who was talking to you,
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.360]   you would have asked me for water.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.440]   But she said, sir, you have nothing to draw with,
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.240]   and the well is deep.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.920]   Where can you get this living water?
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.280]   Are you greater than our father Jacob,
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.480]   who gave us this well and drank from it himself,
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.100]   as did his sons and livestock?
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.480]   And Jesus answered and said,
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.720]   everyone who drinks from the well,
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.280]   from this water, from this well, will be thirsty again.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.760]   I'm gonna hit pause really quick
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.840]   because it'll give us really a launching point
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.000]   into the first idea as it relates to self-care.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.560]   Jesus points out something that all of us,
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.360]   it's not that crazy profound that he just says,
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.000]   hey, if you drink this water, you're gonna thirst again.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.040]   That this will not be something
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.320]   that'll finally satisfy you
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.680]   or satisfy you for more than even a day.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.020]   It'll be something that you'll have to continue
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.360]   to come back to over and over again.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.400]   But he's trying to launch into a conversation
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.520]   with this lady, and he's gonna use the physical idea
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.440]   of water to begin to say, hey, there's thirst that you have
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.440]   that you are unable to meet by yourself.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.880]   The first idea I wanna pull out from this text
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.880]   is that self-care without Christ, or alone,
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.040]   self-care is not enough.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.560]   It will not last, it won't last.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.880]   Self-care without Christ will not last.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.200]   Like Jesus points to herself,
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.320]   hey, if you keep drinking this water,
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.560]   it's really simple, you're gonna have to come back
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.840]   here tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.600]   And he's doing so because he wants to begin
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.240]   to talk about thirsts and something lacking
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.800]   in this lady's life, 'cause Jesus knew
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.760]   who he was talking to.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.880]   This wasn't just any woman.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.520]   This is a woman who didn't just have physical thirst.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.520]   She had voids in her life that she was trying to meet
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.560]   and was coming up empty over and over and over again.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.880]   What do I mean by that?
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.440]   A few verses later, we're told,
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.960]   as they continue the conversation,
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.580]   this was a woman who had been married five times.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.440]   And she was sleeping with a man who is not her husband.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.280]   Today, just a few verses later,
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.560]   Jesus, in the conversation, says,
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.520]   hey, go call your husband.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.520]   She says, I don't have a husband.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.920]   And Jesus says, you're right.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.880]   When you say you have no husband,
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.800]   the fact is you have had five husbands.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.440]   And the man you're sleeping with now,
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.040]   or you have now, is not your husband.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.280]   What you've said is true.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:59.040]   Five husbands today is pretty rare.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.480]   If you meet someone that's on their fifth husband,
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.800]   or on their sixth suitor, their sixth man,
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.040]   it's like, that's pretty unusual.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.760]   In this day, it was unheard of.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.360]   This was a woman that had gone from one relationship
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.080]   to the next to the next and come up empty
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.720]   over and over and over again.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.440]   And Jesus is trying to launch into a conversation saying,
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.840]   hey, if you try to self-care or care for yourself
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.880]   or cope with the emptiness in yourself alone,
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.780]   you will always come up empty over and over and over again.
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:31.940]   That this was a girl, I mean,
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.580]   this is the most clear expression of a girl
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.140]   who is thirsty in all the New Testament.
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.060]   You know what I mean by that?
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.500]   For anyone who's not used to that term,
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.260]   which I feel like is my favorite recent term,
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.180]   not long ago, or a little while ago,
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.020]   I was hanging with a friend, my friend Jake,
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.300]   and he was like, we were talking about some relationship,
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.740]   you're dating, and he brought, he was like,
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.300]   dude, that girl is just thirsty.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.340]   I'm like, like she needs a beverage?
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.540]   What do you mean thirsty?
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.660]   He's like, no, she's like looking for a relationship.
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.820]   But even today, we use this kind of term,
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.740]   and this is a woman who, if anyone in the New Testament
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.220]   is relationally thirsty, it would be her.
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.700]   And she had gone from one to the next to the next,
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.220]   trying to fill this void and come up empty.
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.500]   But if you try to self-care on your own,
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.540]   whether it's through a new workout regimen,
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.340]   whether it's through new goals that you have for this year,
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.180]   whether it's through health,
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.820]   whether it's through a number of spa days,
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.160]   you will always come up empty.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.300]   If you try to just self-cope
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.460]   and self-medicate with the world and experience like,
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.740]   hey man, I need a drink tonight,
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.820]   or I need this new purse, or I need this,
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.620]   fill in the blank, or I need a relationship,
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.580]   you will always come up empty.
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.980]   And Jesus is saying that if you self-care without Christ,
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.700]   you will always find something that does not last.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.440]   Because the truth is, just like she was thirsty,
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.980]   there was a void on the inside.
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.180]   There is a void on inside of all of us.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.000]   That you are thirsty and I am thirsty.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.520]   And if we are not aware of the ways
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.540]   that we will, out of that just void,
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:10.760]   or out of unmet desires, try to meet those things,
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.520]   you are putting yourself in incredible danger.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.640]   Like, candidly, I have thirst,
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.600]   I can have thirsts inside of me,
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.000]   or desires inside of me that are just destructive
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.200]   for me, for people around me, for my family.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.740]   Like a desire for, hey, I just need the approval of people,
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.740]   and I just wanna be liked, that if I let rule my life,
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.500]   will lead me to a place where I no longer
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.220]   am concerned about the things that God cares about,
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.980]   I'm concerned about what you care about.
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.900]   A desire is inside of my life that could lead me
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.300]   to commit adultery because I wanna have sex
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.860]   with women who are not my wife.
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.820]   Desire is inside of me for just money and materialism,
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.260]   and man, I just need to go make a bunch of money.
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.620]   And if I'm not careful, out of that thirst,
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.840]   I will let that thirst lead me to take actions
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.640]   that will impact not just me, but all those around me.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.300]   Where are you thirsty?
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.020]   Maybe it's just an insatiable, like you're constantly
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.160]   consumed with what people think about you,
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.120]   or your social media, or maybe it's a need for control,
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.160]   and you have an eating disorder right now.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.840]   Or just a loneliness that's inside of you
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.480]   that constantly comes up, and it's leading you
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.400]   to make decisions like, I mean, pornography,
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.060]   you know what pornography, the number one reason
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.380]   people who study it would say people get addicted to porn
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.220]   or people watch pornography, they want to feel desired.
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.540]   Thirsty.
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.220]   And the problem is not necessarily that you're thirsty,
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.940]   that's gonna be a reality, it is what you do
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.780]   with that thirst.
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.020]   And you need to have a death grip on the fact
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.300]   that there are desires and things in you
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.860]   that want to run your life into the ground,
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.820]   that wanna lead you to make decisions,
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.760]   that will lead you into every place from a rehab
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.160]   to broken relationship after the next.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.300]   Do you know what those are?
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:03.300]   I have a dog named Judah who is a Rhodesian Ridgeback,
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.760]   he's like, yeah, he's like a little baby elephant.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.440]   He's 130 pounds, he's enormous.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.560]   And yeah, yeah, sweet.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.720]   And he did the weirdest thing.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.320]   This dog will eat out of the trash can while we're gone.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.300]   And that may be like, oh, you know, that's kind of sweet,
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.340]   maybe you have an open trash can.
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.860]   We have a trash can in a drawer.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.700]   He can pull the drawer open because he's like six four
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.500]   and he can get his face in there
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.120]   and eat out of the trash can.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.300]   What happens when a dog eats out of the trash?
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.660]   He's like, I'm hungry, that looks good,
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.140]   and he begins to eat water bottles.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.180]   What happens, you might think,
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.540]   whenever your dog eats water bottles?
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.860]   Well, it causes some complications.
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.140]   And so he is constantly making decisions
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.980]   and out of his hunger, eating from the trash,
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.100]   which leads to all kinds of exciting opportunities
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:52.720]   to be a good neighbor and pick up your dog's liquid
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.620]   that's rushing out of him at times.
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.120]   And you may be like, oh man, that's kind of weird,
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.000]   why are you telling me this thing?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.820]   Here's what will happen because of this decision.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.560]   My dog is what you would call a walking pooper.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.760]   And of course, the appropriate term.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.120]   So because he'll eat trash, then we'll take him to the park,
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.320]   we'll go outside and there's people all around us.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.080]   Any dog owners here, you will have sympathy
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.040]   for what I'm talking about.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.480]   So you go around, you got your dog,
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.880]   you're hanging out at the parks with all these kids.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.660]   Hey, have a great day, sun's outside.
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.100]   And then the dog will be like, oh man,
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.900]   the water bottle is needing to come out,
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.220]   but it can't come out, so he will just begin squatting
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.980]   and walking around and circling people.
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.600]   How do you stop a dog from doing that
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.120]   when you're around people and you're like,
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.020]   he's got a water bottle in there and it's,
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:34.860]   there's nothing coming out.
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.500]   I would get it if it was.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.780]   And literally, he was like going around
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.900]   a two-year-old the other day and I'm like,
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.220]   Judah, stop, Judah, stop it right now.
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.780]   I mean, you can't stop.
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.700]   He's like, dude, when you gotta go, you gotta go.
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.700]   And it is causing complications,
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.160]   not just in his life, but in all those around him.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.120]   In the same way.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.380]   (laughing)
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.900]   There is something, as crazy as it sounds,
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.940]   in me that wants to eat from the trash.
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.700]   And it's not the trash of a trash can,
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.000]   it is the trash of pornography.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   It is the trash of finding my worth in other people.
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.140]   It is the trash of vanity and body image
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.660]   or trash of, hey, if I only made more money.
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.760]   The trash of, man, I wanna be seen as impressive to people.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:29.060]   And it is the trash that if you feed yourself that,
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.020]   it's gonna have side effects.
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.720]   I don't know what trash you are tempted to eat,
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.520]   but you need to have a death grip and awareness on that.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.840]   Because it's not just that self-care
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.040]   without Christ won't last,
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.540]   it is that self-care without Christ can cost you.
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:49.420]   And this woman had followed that inner urge
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.360]   for relational, just connection with one man after the next,
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.540]   after the next, to the point where she's all alone,
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.560]   or she's living this life
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.280]   where she's not even married to this guy.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.080]   I mean, that's why she came in the middle of the day.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.320]   You don't come to a well
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.780]   in the middle of the day at this time.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.800]   The reason she came is because she was an outcast.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.800]   She was an outcast of the outcasts.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.880]   Samaritans were outcasts.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.060]   But even among men,
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.880]   you came in the morning to the well to get water,
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.920]   and at night when it was cool.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.880]   You didn't go in the middle of the day
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.200]   unless you didn't wanna see anybody.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.360]   And this was a woman who had made decision after decision
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:27.360]   out of her desire, and she'd found herself empty and alone.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.320]   And Jesus says, you've gotta seek outside of yourself,
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.680]   and there is a solution.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.840]   He continues in verse 16, 14, I'm sorry.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.720]   But whoever drinks the water, Jesus speaking,
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:45.400]   that I give them will never thirst.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.720]   Indeed, the water that I give them will become in them
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.460]   a spring of water welling up to eternal life.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.040]   What are you saying, Jesus?
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.720]   Jesus is using this metaphor of water.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.620]   Water is that thing that like the body, it has to have.
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.960]   Your body's like 50% water.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.000]   If you don't have water, you will die.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.760]   And unlike food, you can kinda last a little water
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.800]   but without water, you will die.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.760]   It's necessary for life.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.480]   And Jesus says in the same way that physical water
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.560]   is necessary to life, I offer a spiritual water
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.160]   that if you are gonna experience self-care,
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.020]   if you're gonna experience soul care,
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.440]   you're gonna have to have something from me.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.240]   The second idea from this text is that self-care
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.040]   with Christ involves soul care.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.280]   Jesus is trying to say I to whoever is interested,
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.000]   whoever is willing, whoever will receive it,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.760]   I will offer them something that won't just quench
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.640]   their thirst and go into their stomach.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.560]   I offer them something that will penetrate into their soul
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:46.100]   where nothing else can or like nothing else can.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:50.240]   It would be such a tragedy if this year you met
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.840]   all of your goals as it relates to health and self-care
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.040]   and boundaries, and I hope you meet all of them.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:00.360]   But you forfeited the thing that is your deepest need
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.480]   which is care at the soul.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.680]   It would be such a tragedy if you came here tonight
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.160]   and you had a good time, you laughed,
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.620]   and the music was cool, but you didn't walk away
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:16.620]   experiencing relief at your greatest, deepest need
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.440]   which is at your soul, and Jesus says I alone
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.900]   am the one who can meet that need.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.020]   And self-care without me is foolish, it will not last,
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.480]   but self-care with me will involve a soul care.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.680]   That is what my desire for you to experience is.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.080]   A relief almost.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:38.680]   I wanna meet you at a place that nothing else in life
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.720]   can touch which is the soul.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.480]   It's not hard to see like so many of the things
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.880]   that we think in life actually would satisfy.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.920]   They never do.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.800]   I mean like just if you think about it,
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.160]   like two clear ways that you can, all of us
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.480]   could probably see this is if you're in a relationship
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.280]   that you can, all of us could probably see this
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.720]   is one of them I would call the like
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.200]   I can't wait until mentality.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.280]   I can't wait until mentality.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.080]   People have this idea, I mean I remember having it
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.640]   where man I just can't wait till I'm dating.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.400]   I'm dating someone, can't wait till we're engaged.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.160]   We're engaged, can't wait till I'm married.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.400]   Oh man, it's gonna be amazing.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.520]   We get married, man I can't wait till we have kids.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.320]   To have kids, I can't wait till we have kids
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.840]   that can dress themselves and sleep.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.440]   I can't wait until they're in school.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.300]   I can't wait till, it just goes from one thing to the next.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.600]   And I don't know where, inside of the room
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.120]   I know most of us are either dating,
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.160]   maybe seriously dating, and if any of that mentality
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.480]   is like I can't wait, you are chasing a moving target
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.720]   that just moves along with you.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.880]   Same thing happens with money.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.560]   I mean remember in college when like I just can't wait
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.480]   to have a job, unbelievable 30 grand,
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.120]   I'm just like throwing money everywhere.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.120]   And then you're like I can't wait till I have 40 grand,
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.920]   50 grand, and it never goes away.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.440]   Because there's something inside of you
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.600]   that no amount of money, no relationship,
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.060]   nothing can touch but him, but Jesus.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.600]   And he says self-care with me involves a soul care
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.220]   that I wanna come in and allow them to experience
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:10.220]   at the deepest level, satisfaction.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.200]   The second place we see it is in just like celebrities.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.400]   I mean you look at these people, I mean they're so,
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.540]   you're like you are the most attractive, wealthy,
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.140]   successful person ever and you work like you make a movie
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.140]   where someone just tells you to read a line
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.980]   for like a month, a year, you have everything
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.420]   anybody could ever want and the number of them
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.660]   that are on antidepressants is unbelievable.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.220]   Just look into it.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.780]   The number of them who've come out from Cameron Diaz
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.500]   to Tom Brady to Brad Pitt to Jim Carrey to Lady Gaga,
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.840]   Demi Lovato, on and on and said like hey,
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.740]   if you think anything he will satisfy, you are deceived.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.660]   I mean just think even about the idea,
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.260]   they've got everything you ever want.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:54.300]   They've got more access to self-care than we'll ever have.
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.260]   They get a massage a day, they get to have their own masseuse.
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.180]   They could go shopping whenever they want
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.480]   and not really get worried about it.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.180]   Like they're able to go on vacation whenever they want to.
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:09.020]   They own a little small island and they're all depressed
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.680]   or many of them are.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.460]   I mean think about that.
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.220]   You're going to Tahiti in your own little vacation
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:21.060]   and you're packing pills to help you cope
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.020]   with the depression of your life.
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.460]   That's crazy and I'm not saying anything
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.820]   about even antidepressant meds.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.660]   That's not my point.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.220]   My point is the people who have the life
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.220]   that everyone would go oh, that's amazing
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:36.220]   are trying to cope with just the sadness
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.960]   of the reality of their life 'cause there's something empty
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.340]   in them that no success, no fame, no money
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.220]   can ever satisfy and Jesus would say you're thirsty
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.980]   and there is only one well that can meet that need.
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:52.620]   There was an interview just with Tom Brady who does it again.
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:58.540]   I mean the dude's like 85 and he is just crushing it.
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.900]   It's unbelievable, Tom.
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.900]   Give everybody else a shot, okay?
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:07.260]   Sorry Patriots people and it's true
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.420]   and he interviewed on 60 Minutes and basically
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.220]   he said just this exact thing.
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.660]   He's the guy who's won multiple Super Bowls.
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.820]   He's married to this supermodel and here's what he said.
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.380]   Why do I have three Super Bowl rings
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.180]   and I think there's still something greater
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.920]   out there for me?
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.300]   I mean a lot of people would say hey man, this is it.
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:30.140]   I reached my goal, my dream, my life.
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:34.540]   Me, I think God, there's gotta be more than this.
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.480]   I mean this can't be all that it's cracked up to be.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.860]   What's the answer, they asked him.
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.800]   He said I wish that I knew.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.040]   I wish I knew.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.300]   I think there's a lot of parts about me
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.140]   that I'm still trying to find.
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.100]   Translation, what did you just say, Tom Brader?
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.380]   The guy who's literally got, you'd be like
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.460]   that's gotta be nice.
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:58.040]   He says I climbed the mountain of success
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.140]   and I got to the top and there was nothing there.
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.980]   I've been on the wrong mountain.
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.020]   It's empty and Jesus would say
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.620]   there is no amount of success, no amount of money,
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.320]   no amount of relationship, there's no man out there,
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.540]   there's no woman out there, there's no ability
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.120]   to have children or whatever you find yourself being like.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:24.120]   I wish, there's no job that can ultimately satisfy
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.500]   and there's no person who's in any circumstance out there
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:31.100]   that cannot currently experience satisfaction
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.000]   if it was turned to him.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.060]   Jim Carrey said that I wish everyone could be rich
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.920]   and famous so they could see how empty
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.220]   and meaningless it all is.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:43.820]   It's empty.
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:48.240]   So Jesus interacts with this woman
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.520]   and he basically presses in and says
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.340]   you've been married five times.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:58.200]   One man to the next, you're thirsty
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.080]   and I offer you a water that can quench your thirst
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.040]   and he begins to kind of press in on an area
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.720]   that had to be a sensitive subject with this woman
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.800]   and what does she do?
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.880]   She does what many of us do.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.680]   When God is kind of pressing in on us
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.220]   and we try to move away from it or change the subject,
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.060]   here's what happens.
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.460]   The woman said, sir, give me this water
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.540]   so I won't be thirsty, you have to come draw here
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.060]   and he told her, go and call your husband.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.560]   You read this earlier.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.820]   I have no husband, she said.
[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.620]   Jesus said to her, you are right when you say
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.320]   you have no husband, the fact is you've had five
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.220]   and the man you have now is not your husband.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.220]   What you've said is quite true.
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:43.200]   How long was the pause after that sentence?
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.940]   I mean, this is, I don't even know a modern equivalent.
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:52.720]   That a random stranger shows up and actually tells you
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.700]   something, there's like no way that he could know this
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.000]   and she begins to say, sir, I perceive that you are a prophet
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.900]   I can see that you're a prophet
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.580]   and then she does what so many of us do.
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.500]   Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.180]   but you Jews claim that the place
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.540]   where we must worship is in Jerusalem.
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:13.300]   Jesus brings up kind of this very tender topic with her
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.300]   and she's like, oh wow, okay, relational,
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.340]   you wanna talk about my relationships.
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.980]   While we're on the subject, you guys say we should worship
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.780]   on this mountain, let's talk about mountains
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.380]   and just tries to distract from the conversation
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.780]   and Jesus, you gotta love Jesus 'cause he goes with her
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:32.420]   and he says, woman, believe me, a time is coming
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.140]   when you will worship the Father
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.840]   neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.640]   You Samaritans worship what you do not know,
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.340]   we worship what we do know for salvation is from the Jews.
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.620]   Basically like God gave the Old Testament, the Bible then,
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:46.660]   to the Jewish people.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.500]   Yet a time is coming and has now come
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.420]   when true worshipers will worship the Father
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.980]   in spirit and in truth
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.300]   for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.140]   Jesus says, you're defining worship as you do worship
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.720]   at this mountain or that mountain or in this church
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.040]   or in this church building or at this time of the week
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.800]   or on Sunday, worship is not something you do at a building,
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.100]   it's not about where you worship
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.360]   or even when you worship, worship is something you do
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.540]   in spirit as in constantly.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.940]   Worship is more about how you live your life.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:21.040]   You're constantly living and constantly worshiping
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.660]   if you're worshiping or living in spirit and truth,
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.380]   Jesus says, for God is spirit and his worshipers
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.280]   must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.060]   The woman said, I know that the Messiah,
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.320]   called the Christ, is coming and when he comes,
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.340]   he'll explain everything to us.
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:39.440]   Then Jesus declared, I, the one speaking to you, am he.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.280]   We're gonna come back to that in a second,
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.080]   but Jesus essentially lays out, hey, worship,
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.100]   the most important thing about worship
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.580]   is not where you worship but who you worship
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.200]   and how you worship.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.180]   Now, worship is something that's constantly going on
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.000]   and God is not seeking people to worship him
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.060]   in a building in a moment or not some religious exercise
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.420]   but a relationship.
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.420]   Self-care, if you're gonna experience it this year,
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.840]   and gosh, I want,
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.820]   if you're gonna experience self-care, health, growth,
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.060]   you to become everything that you wanna be in life,
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.300]   it is gonna involve the third idea,
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.340]   which self-care with Christ
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.760]   involves an ongoing relationship with him.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:18.580]   It involves an ongoing relationship with Jesus,
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:22.300]   a growing relationship with him,
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.960]   not some religious action, that's what he's saying,
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.460]   hey, in spirit, constantly in connection with the Father.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.020]   If you're gonna experience self-care,
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.800]   it involves an ongoing relationship,
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.060]   which means in order for you to have a growing relationship,
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:35.900]   what do you have to do?
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.980]   What do you have to do to grow any relationship?
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.820]   It takes time, communication,
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:43.520]   listening to one another, prioritizing.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:48.020]   If you're gonna experience growing
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:53.020]   and being increasingly healthy, self-care,
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.060]   it will involve a growing relationship.
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.900]   You will prioritize spending time in God's word,
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.420]   that's what I mean by listening.
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.500]   You will prioritize prayer.
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.120]   One of the things that is at the top of my list,
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.380]   dude, I just wanna pray more this year.
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.280]   I wanna continue to just develop the habit of,
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.800]   God, when my life is going crazy,
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.440]   will you help me turn to you?
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.740]   God, will you help me pray more?
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.980]   I'm about to walk into this meeting,
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.500]   I'm concerned about what they're gonna think about me,
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.500]   or maybe I'm just anxious,
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:21.200]   or God, I can't fall asleep right now, will you help me?
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.580]   If you're gonna experience a growing relationship,
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.380]   it's gonna involve spending time in God's word,
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.660]   spending time in prayer,
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.380]   growing that relationship, priority,
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.620]   it's gonna involve work.
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.280]   There's no relationship, if you get married,
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.740]   or if you are married, there's no marriage out there
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.180]   that doesn't take work, relationships,
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.180]   take prioritization and work.
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.120]   And if you're gonna grow your relationship with Jesus,
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.780]   it's going to involve this happening.
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:52.440]   I think one of the craziest, or maybe the saddest thing,
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.900]   so when you read this, you're like, Jesus says,
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:57.540]   hey, drink the water I give you, you'll never thirst again.
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.280]   And there's a lot of Christians,
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.240]   because they don't practice what Jesus said
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.560]   of worshiping in spirit and in truth,
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.340]   worship constantly, having a relationship with God,
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:10.060]   because they don't practice that, they're thirsty.
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.380]   Like you may be a Christian in the room,
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:12.900]   and you're like, dude, I believe in that,
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.860]   yeah, the whole Jesus thing,
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.500]   yeah, Jesus satisfied thirst, yeah, that's great,
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.180]   I'm in on that, but I'm still empty.
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:22.580]   There's still part of me that just feels like empty.
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:26.060]   And it's because you are not taking advantage
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.220]   of what you have access to, a relationship with God.
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.120]   You're not prioritizing your relationship,
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.300]   spending time in His word, spending time with Him,
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.280]   walking with God's people.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.080]   You have access to something that you've started,
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.560]   but you're not consistently applying it to your life.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.800]   It's not dissimilar to this.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:45.960]   Remember, I talked about the chiropractor,
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.580]   so I went, and while I was there,
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.680]   I went three times, like in a few days,
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.840]   and it was like, dude, this is awesome, amazing.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.440]   And they were like, yeah, if you sign up
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.800]   for 70 bucks a month, you can have an unlimited pass.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.440]   I'm like, unlimited pass, I can come in here any time?
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.340]   Unlimited pass, done, sign on the dotted line.
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.400]   I haven't been back since.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.920]   I need to go cancel it, but you can't do it over the phone.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.920]   And it had been a year, I kept the membership.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.320]   And you came up to me and you were like,
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.040]   hey, you mentioned the chiropractor thing,
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.760]   how's that going, still a believer,
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.960]   I'm thinking about doing it myself,
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.440]   and I was like, you know, it worked initially,
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.600]   but it really hasn't worked since.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.880]   I mean, I haven't been back since,
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.700]   but I don't know that I would really encourage
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.760]   anyone to do that, you would say
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.740]   the problem is not with chiropractors,
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.160]   it's that you're not going.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:42.160]   You're not taking advantage of what you have access to.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.640]   The problem is not that Jesus doesn't bring satisfaction,
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.620]   the problem is that you are not taking advantage
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:52.800]   of what you have access to,
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.120]   and if you're gonna experience self-care,
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.920]   it's gonna involve an ongoing relationship,
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.520]   that's what God, it says in the text,
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.320]   the Father is seeking you.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.200]   Not for you to do some deed once a week
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.840]   and religious act, to have a relationship with you.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.980]   That's what God is seeking.
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.180]   And if you're gonna experience that,
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.880]   like here's the problem, a lot of people in the world
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.320]   are like, yeah, I'm kind of, you know,
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.400]   I'm a follower of Jesus, I believe in him,
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.940]   living water, great, and I'm kind of experiencing
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:20.880]   my purpose, it's 'cause you're kind of following Jesus.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:25.180]   Hey, I'm kind of experiencing peace,
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.920]   it's 'cause you're kind of following Jesus,
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.880]   which I may not even really be following Jesus.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:34.060]   And he's inviting you, man, I want you to experience
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.500]   the life you were made for.
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:39.300]   But it's gonna involve prioritizing, spending time with me.
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:44.020]   In summary, just this idea that self-care
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.520]   without Christ won't last.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:51.560]   Self-care with Christ brings soul care,
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:56.560]   and self-care with Christ is an ongoing relationship.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:01.020]   When I was in college, my senior year,
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.640]   we had the final spring break, which was so sad.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.180]   Just 'cause you don't get those anymore.
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:09.100]   And my roommates, we were deciding what to do,
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:13.620]   and there was this girl that I was all interested in,
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.820]   and I knew where she and her friends
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.100]   were going for spring break, so I was like,
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.900]   guys, hey, look, beach, it's gonna be great.
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.940]   Her and her friends were going to Destin, Florida,
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:23.300]   we weren't dating, and I was like,
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.380]   we should go to Destin, Florida.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.780]   How great would that be?
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.780]   And they're like, with all the families?
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.260]   And I'm like, it's gonna be great.
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.860]   Good family experience together.
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:36.000]   And convinced them, we were gonna go to Alabama,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.140]   and convinced them to go way out of our way
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:41.020]   just 'cause there was a relationship with this girl,
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:45.280]   who's now my wife, that, yeah, I know,
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.220]   that's gonna be closing prayer, okay?
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.740]   And just wanted everyone to know.
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.900]   That I was going out of my way to seek
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.540]   to be in a relationship with her.
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:02.120]   This text, over and over, talks about seeking.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:07.200]   There's a woman, and she's seeking to fill a void
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.220]   that her relationships can't meet.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.140]   And she's trying one after the next after the next,
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:15.100]   and she's still empty, she's thirsty inside, she's seeking.
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:19.580]   It says that Jesus was seeking her.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:20.860]   I mean, think about how it started.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.780]   Jesus had to go to Samaria.
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.700]   Think about that sentence for a second.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.940]   You had to?
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.020]   You're Jesus.
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.520]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.260]   And he woke up that morning and said, I've gotta go,
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.700]   there's a woman I'm gonna go meet.
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.360]   She's the outcast of outcasts.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.020]   She's the woman that no one wants to have anything to do with
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.360]   but the Son of God.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:48.700]   And he woke up with her on his mind.
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.220]   He was seeking a relationship with her.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.180]   The very first person in all of the Bible
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:55.180]   that Jesus says, I'm the Messiah,
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:58.620]   is the most relationally dysfunctional person
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:34:59.740]   in all of the Bible.
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:04.760]   And he says, I haven't given up on you.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.340]   And she believed that day.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.980]   And the story goes on, and all of her life was changed.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:15.260]   Because it was a man who was seeking,
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.340]   and she responded to that.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.180]   No, no, they didn't say that.
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.380]   It says the Father is seeking a relationship with you.
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:21.220]   Here's what I know.
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.500]   If you're inside of the room right now,
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.620]   there's a God who wants something so much more for you
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.980]   than just a message on Tuesday night
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:28.420]   or a worship song on Tuesday night.
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:29.780]   He wants a relationship with you.
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.460]   And from the very first breath you took in our planet,
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.540]   he's been seeking you.
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.060]   Until the last day that you live on our planet,
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.860]   he will be seeking you.
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.680]   How do I know that?
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.200]   Because the very same word that it says,
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.980]   Jesus had to go to Samaria,
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.500]   is used in Matthew chapter 16,
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.980]   where Jesus looked at Jerusalem
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.620]   and he said, "I have to go to Jerusalem to die
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.380]   "on behalf of the human race,
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.180]   "on behalf of every person that's ever sat
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.060]   "in any one of these seats,
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.420]   "who's ever lived on this planet."
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.460]   If you're listening to me right now,
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.740]   there's a God who was there who is seeking you.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.620]   You woke up this morning and he is crazy about you.
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.540]   He's seeking you.
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:05.020]   You think that there is a God out there,
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:05.940]   that if he's there,
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.920]   I don't think he wants anything to do with me.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.180]   I'm a porn addict, I'm an abortion.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.620]   I've had an abortion.
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:13.260]   I was a part of telling someone to have an abortion.
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.180]   I'm an addict.
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.060]   And you think the God who's there
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:19.300]   doesn't want anything to do with you.
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.860]   You don't want anything to do with you.
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:22.360]   And he's crazy about you.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.720]   And he is doing everything he can to seek out,
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.620]   not so that you would just trust in him,
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.840]   though that is enough,
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.940]   so that you would walk with him
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.060]   and have a relationship with him this year.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.500]   My prayer for you, my prayer for this message would be,
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.220]   God, would you awaken us to have an ongoing,
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.740]   constant, growing relationship with you?
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.860]   Where we experience our spirit and in truth relationship
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.820]   with the Father who's there, who's been seeking you.
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.740]   Even right now, there are some of you that are here
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:51.740]   and a friend invited you
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.380]   and you thought you were going to the porch restaurant
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:54.920]   and you're like, what are we doing here?
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.820]   The Father is seeking you.
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:57.940]   He has not forgotten you.
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:59.060]   He is crazy about you.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.780]   He has given his life for you.
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.580]   Because just like he had to go to Samaria,
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.600]   he says, I have to go to the cross
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.300]   because for the joy set before him,
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.640]   Hebrews chapter 12 says, he died for you.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.660]   And so I don't know where you are.
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.160]   I don't know what you believe.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.040]   But there is one man who can satisfy the desires
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.880]   of your soul, you were made for it.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.540]   And there is no other well that can.
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:26.980]   And tonight, he is seeking you
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.360]   and reaching in your direction, all of our direction
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:35.360]   and inviting us to walk and accept him
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.800]   and walk with him in relationship.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.640]   Let me pray.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.060]   (soft music)
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:50.960]   Father, thank you that you are a God
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.960]   who goes out of your way for sinful, broken people
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.560]   like me, like this woman who had no idea
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.080]   what she was gonna encounter that day,
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.700]   but she just went to get water and avoid people.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.680]   There was a God who couldn't avoid meeting her.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.240]   And I pray for friends in the room
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.960]   who have never accepted that,
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:14.960]   who have never come to just acknowledge or understand
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.640]   that you are not there demanding
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:21.160]   some sort of sacraments from us,
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.960]   but you gave a sacrifice for us by giving your life
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:27.240]   and dying in our place to pay for all the sins
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.760]   in our past and our present.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.320]   And no matter our story, you're not done with us.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.800]   And you have been pursuing us
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:38.080]   in ways that we can't even fully see now.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:44.080]   But we for sure can see the pursuit of you on the cross.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:47.480]   And so Lord, for anyone who's never put their faith
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.880]   in Christ tonight, I pray that tonight would be their night.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.920]   They would not leave their seat,
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.880]   they would not leave this building
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.700]   without coming to a confident place in their faith in you.
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.440]   I pray that you would allow those of us
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.420]   with one foot in the world and one foot out of it
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:01.900]   that are kind of following Jesus
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.240]   and kind of experiencing peace
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.000]   to take a step in your direction.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.580]   (gentle music)
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.440]   And experience self-care,
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.320]   the self-care they're looking for.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.360]   That the truth is, there's a self-care
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.080]   that's been looking for us,
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.160]   despite the fact that we didn't even realize it.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.260]   A self-care by the name of Christ.
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:28.800]   Thank you that you're a God who seeks.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.160]   We worship you now in song.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:40.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
