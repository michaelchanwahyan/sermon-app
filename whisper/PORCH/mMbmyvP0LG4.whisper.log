[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   [music]
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   All right, Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   [cheers]
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Yeah, it's good to be here.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   It's been a while since I've been with you guys on a Tuesday night.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   My name's Todd. I hang out here at Watermark with the rest of the guys
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   that normally get to encourage you a little bit,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   and I am glad to be with you and all the friends that jump in with us online.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   We are making our way through the book of 1 Peter.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   You know, you come in a room like this,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   and especially if a friend invited you for the first time,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   you're tuning in because you've heard about this thing called the porch,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   and you hear they're just studying, verse by verse,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   a book of the Bible by a guy named Peter,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   and you're like, "All right.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   What in the world is this going to have to do with me?
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   This book was written a long time ago by a guy that I'm not really sure
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   had anything to say.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   How could it be relevant to my life?"
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I'm going to show you how exceedingly relevant the Word of God is.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   God's Word is timeless.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   It is profitable to teach you.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   In fact, when it says that in the Scripture,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   that's a Bible verse, it's profitable for teaching,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   it means it alone can do what nothing else can do.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Why is that?
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Well, see, I'm 50 years old.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   I'm about three decades older than most of you guys that are in this room,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   and so one of the things you want to do is learn from folks
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   who have done stuff before you.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Now, here's just a little syllogism that is true.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   It's been observed by men throughout time.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It's simply this, and that is that wise men learn more from fools
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   than fools do from wise men.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Because while wise men will learn from the affliction of fools,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   fools will not learn from the blessing of the wise,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   because they think they've got it all figured out.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   They've got nothing to learn.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   That's why so many times that old joke is,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   "Man, I can't believe how much an old man learned
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   between the time I was 18 and 25."
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Because the things that you rebelled against him when you were in high school,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   all of a sudden you're out there in that workaday world,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   and you're realizing that maybe some of the things
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   your dad was encouraging you towards made a little bit of sense.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   That's even more true when you're 50 and you're raising your own kids,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   and you start to hear some of the same things come out of your mouth,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   and the same passion for the younger generation,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   now that you're stewards over,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   you're desperate for them to know.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I got better news for you than a guy who's three decades ahead of you
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   telling you something,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   because I'm going to share with you something that's even more profitable
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   than the wisdom of guys that have lived five, six, seven decades.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I want you to hear from a loving, eternal God
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   that is determined to record for you truths that will set you free,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   because that's what God wants to do.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   He's not looking to rip you off.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   He's looking to set you free.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Every now and then, he worked in the context of history
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   to have imperfect men
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   produced for him by the enabling of his spirit.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   That shouldn't be a big deal to you, right?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   If there is a God and he's there,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   couldn't he use me to paint some amazing--
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I've got zero talent as an artist.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I've got even less talent as a singer.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   But if God wanted to,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   couldn't he kind of make all of a sudden my hand
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   just throw out some Rembrandt-like masterpiece?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Of course, otherwise he's not God.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   If God wanted to, couldn't he have me become some virtuoso?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Absolutely, if God wanted to.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Couldn't he have me write something that would make Shakespeare want?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Yes.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   And that's what God did.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   He said, "At certain times in history, because I love people,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   "I'm going to communicate to them,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   "and I'm going to take finite men,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   "and I'm going to give through them infinite truth.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   "I'm going to take individuals that are imperfect,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   "and I'm going to produce for them perfect truth."
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Then what he did is he perfectly preserved that.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   By the way, that's not my idea.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   That's historians' idea.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   They will tell you that your Bible is the most historically preserved book in history.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   More than that,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   it is a book that has been put together in a way that absolutely makes no sense.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   What if I told you that I was going to take 40 different authors,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   have them write in three different languages,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   across 10 civilizations,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   over a period of like 3,000 years?
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And then I was going to say, "And what they write never contradicts.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   "What they write is always without error,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   "and what they write always deals with the same problem and offers the same solution."
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   You would go, "Only God could pull that off."
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   That's what your Bible is.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   When I say it's the most historically preserved book in all of history,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   we have more manuscripts,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   manual, handwritten, script means to write,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   more recorded copies of the original autographs.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Autograph isn't just a guy's name.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   It's when they first wrote things down.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   We have more copies of what was initially written down
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   than any other ancient book in history by the tens of thousands.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So we can be sure that what we're reading today
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   is a historically accurate representation of what we had written
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   when it came right off of Peter's pen.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And Peter's going to tell you that everything he wrote was inspired,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   but there were certain books that were preserved,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   and certain books that were left for you.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Why?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Because the highest ideal of a philosopher
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   is that he would hear a more sure word from God.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   A philosopher is a lover of wisdom.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   That's just what it means.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Philo, lover.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Sophia, wisdom.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   A lover of wisdom.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And Plato is the one that said this.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   He said, "Until we hear a still more sure word from God,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   we're going to be like ships making their way through the sea
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   in a storm in the middle of the night.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   There's nothing anchored in the heavens, stars,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   fixed lights in the universe that we can navigate by.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   All we got to do is trust what we think are the most experienced sailors
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   on our ship, and there's nothing certain.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It's a storm.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   There's truth that is anchored up there that is veiled.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And so what do you think we should do?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Which way should we go?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   How should we sail?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   That's led many a folks to shipwrecks.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Some made their way through.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And what I'm here to tell you
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   is that this book that we're studying tonight is God preserving for you
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   an anchored truth.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   It is light in the midst of the darkness.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   It is revelation.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   It is the veil pulled back that you might learn something
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   that would be useful to you.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   1 Peter 4.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   You ready?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Let's look at it.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   We're only going to cover six verses.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   That's all they gave me.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   So let's see if we can't cover them.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Here we go.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   "Therefore" -- now I'm going to stop right there.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   This is why they gave me six verses.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I can't talk about one word.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Whenever you see a "therefore," you've got to ask yourself,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   "What's it there for?"
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   See, you guys already know this.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   We won't spend long.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   The "therefore" that is there is there because we just got done reading chapter 3.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   See, you're bright.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I don't have to review that for you.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Three comes before four.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And so there's a truth that has been revealed right there
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   that we've got to focus on.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   What is it?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   This is the truth for Christ, Jesus,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   this guy who claimed to be God on earth.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   He died for sins once and for all, not because people took his life.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   He said, "I'm going to lay my life down."
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   The way you're going to know that this is my choosing and not yours,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   there's a reason that when Pilate grabbed me and said,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   "Hey, man, don't you know who I am?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I can set you free."
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Jesus grabbed him, I think, by the scruff of his royal robe and said,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   "Hey, man, you've got no power unless my Father in Heaven gives it to you."
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Jesus knew exactly who he was, exactly why he was here,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   and exactly what he was doing.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Nobody took his life.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   He laid it down and he said, "As evidence of that,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I'm going to pick it back up again."
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Watch this.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   "Is it true, Jesus, that you said that the temple would be destroyed
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   and three days later you would raise it from the grave?"
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   He said, "Just watch."
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   If you think it's a miracle and they thought it was,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   that Jesus was referring to Herod's temple that was built over a period of years
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   at a massive cost using all kinds of slave labor,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   you can't do that in three days.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Well, I'll tell you what else you can't do.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   You can't take a life that has been killed,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   certified as dead, and bring it back unless you were up to something
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   and you were somebody that was doing something that all of us needed to know about.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   "For Christ also died for our sins once and for all, the just Jesus,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   perfect, righteous one of God, for the unjust, me and you,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   so that he might bring us to God."
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   That's why he said, "I'm doing it."
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Because God -- people ask all the time, "Does the cross show God's love for us?"
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Well, the cross primarily shows God's holiness.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   God didn't die for you.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   I hate to bust your little bubble.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   God died for him.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   See, God is a God of holiness and righteousness and justice,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   and he will not put up with sin.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   I'm going to walk you through the meta-narrative of the Bible.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I'm going to tell you why you're here,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   and I'm going to tell you why now that you live here it's so important,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   especially if you understand what we're going to talk about tonight.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Are you ready?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Do you know that in the beginning of Genesis 1 is not the beginning of the Bible?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   In the beginning of Genesis 1 is the beginning of God's interaction with recorded human history.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   But there is Bible, there is story that existed before that.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   That's why when we're placed here on earth and created, he says, "I'm going to tell you,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   here's truth, there's a liar there on earth.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   He is the prince of that world, but I am the king of the universe.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   He's going to try and deceive you and tell you that you don't need me.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   I'm telling you that you need me.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   He comes to steal, kill, and destroy, but I've come that you might have life,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   so walk with me.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   You need nothing but the trust of me."
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   But because God is not a God who creates robots, he's a God of love,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   he gave you a chance to show your love for him.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   He put you in a perfect place, gave you perfect provision.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   We call it Edenic.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   We call it paradise.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   He just said, "Just don't eat of that one tree."
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Because that one tree shows that you have faith in me and you believe in me
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   and we have a relationship.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   As long as you've got a relationship with me, life is good.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   If you separate yourself from me, the God of life and goodness,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   you're going to get death and evil.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   So don't go there.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   But you know, you're free if you want to follow a liar.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   What happened is that God created the angelic realm before that.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   We know that that's exactly what had preexisted us, and there became a day.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   We see this in Isaiah 14, Ezekiel 28, and other things.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Actually, the beginning of your Bible is even referenced in John 1.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   God always dwelled in perfect triune unity.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   And he created angelic beings, ministering spirits that were there to honor him,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   worship him, and benefit from his creating them, being in his presence.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   One of them said, "I don't think we need God."
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   One of them specifically that we know his job, because God was so holy,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   angels couldn't look directly at God, was to reflect the glory of God
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   so other angels would, in fact, look at them and see God in the reflection through him.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   That one angel was so used to people looking at him, he goes, "You know what?
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Maybe they're looking at me not because I reflect the glory of God.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Maybe they're looking at me because my life is so awesome and wonderful.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   I think I'm God. I think, in fact, I could do better than God."
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And so he said, "Worship me."
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And God cast him out of his presence.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And a third of the angels believed that lie, that there was somebody more great than God.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   So we see God's justice and holiness right from the beginning.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   He doesn't put up with people that try and usurp his power and usurp his person.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Why? Not because he's insecure, but because when you trust in something less than perfect beauty and love,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   you're going to get something less than perfect beauty and love.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Some of you guys know that.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Because you've been chasing beauty and love in all the wrong places.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   And you've got the scars to prove it.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   And God's not mad at you.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Christ died for your sins and mine, the just for the unjust,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   knowing that it might bring you back to God.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   So what happens?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   What God's going to do is something amazing.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   He's going to create this thing in his image, this people, humankind, male and female, both glorious in his image.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   He created them. He placed them on earth.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   He put them on earth.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   And on that earth, he put them in a perfect situation to enjoy him forever.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   But he said, "You've got to walk with me and have a relationship with me.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   I'm not going to make you have it. I'm just going to show you that you should.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   There's nothing in your life. There's no death. There's no sin.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   There's no shame. You can be naked and unashamed.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Because you're so other-centered."
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Can you imagine that? Isn't that all of our nightmare? Right?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   We've all had the dream. If we didn't, we act like we had the dream.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Because that's the ultimate nightmare dream when you're a kid in second grade.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   You had a dream that you went to school in your underwear. Right?
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Okay? Or when you get a little older, it's like something happened where you're just naked at school.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   And you know, you're walking around like you're Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 70s.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   All proud of yourself. Alright?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   You're like, "This isn't a good thing."
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   But can you imagine us being so other-centered, so not driven by the lust of our flesh,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   that we could be with each other naked and unashamed?
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   I mean, it's just unfathomable to me.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Because I'm a lust bucket. Alright?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And because I'm an insecure, self-centered person that would wonder what you're thinking about me all the time.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Because this flesh has fallen and trapped by sin and a liar.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   But God put me on this earth to reflect His glory.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   And as long as humankind walked with God, we were glorious.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Now watch this.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   He knew in putting us here that eventually we would betray His name.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   And God also knew that because we'd betray His name, we would suffer.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   You're like, "Why would God create a world where He knew people that He loved made in His image would suffer?"
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Because God was going to show something that would never be seen unless He put us on earth.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   And that's not just His justice and wrath.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   That had already been displayed when the angels were judged.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   But now God's about to show His kindness and His goodness and His love and His mercy.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Things that had never been understood.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   They hypothetically existed, but God had never had a chance to show it.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   And so these people that were created in His image, that had been given perfect paradise,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   who rebelled against Him and scoffed at His name, is God going to destroy them?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   No, God's going to rescue them.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   How?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Because in the beginning, the God who was the Word, but was not God, but was with God,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   the second person, the Trinity, Jesus, was going to come.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   And He was going to live a perfect and holy life.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   And even though He didn't deserve the wages of sin, He was going to pay it.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   So He could rescue you and bring you back to God.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   And not only that, but because you, as a human, went through this amazing revelation of God,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   where the angels are beholden and going, "What is He doing? He's becoming a baby.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   What's He doing? He's going to a cross.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   What kind of God is this?"
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   The angels sang when they saw the love of God.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   The angels were filled with just awe.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   The Scripture says in 1 Peter, "Things in which the angels longed to look."
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Actually, 2 Peter, it's like, "Who is this God that loves this way, that rescues sinners, who is holy?"
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   See, that's why God went to the cross, because He was going to show you that He doesn't wink at sin.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   He doesn't say, "Ah, men will be men. Come on in."
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   He says, "No, that's sin. It offends me. It separates you from me, and it must be dealt with.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   But I'm going to show you love.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   I'll take your justice,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   so you can see my kindness and be drawn back to me for it."
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   The "therefore" is "therefore" because of 1 Peter 3, 18.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Let's say it again.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   "For Christ," it says in the Scripture,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   "also died for sins once and for all,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   the just for the unjust,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   but made alive in the Spirit."
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Therefore.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   In light of what Jesus did for you, in light of who He is,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   in light of the fact that you are that scourge of the earth, like me,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   who mocked God's goodness, who thought we could find life going our own way,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   who ate of the tree of good and evil,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   because we think, "If I know good, I don't have to listen to God anymore."
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   The problem is, God said, "Hey, listen. I'm happy to tell you what's good. Follow me."
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   See, God wasn't trying to keep information from us.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   He just knew, if we separated ourselves from Him,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   it doesn't matter what kind of information we've got.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   We're not going to choose the way of life.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Let me ask you guys a question.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Most of the mistakes you're making in your life right now,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   I'm not talking about at work, I'm talking about in your living,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   are they mistakes you're making because you don't know better?
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Or are they mistakes that you're making because you know better,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   but you just can't do the right you know you need to do?
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   You know, girls, you're not supposed to stick your finger down your mouth to throw up,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   so guys think for a little bit in your 20s you were attractive.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   You know, guys, that girls aren't playthings,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   that they're made in the image of God and they're not there for your pleasure.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   They're there to be honored and cherished. You know better.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   You know, guys, that life isn't worth living so you can win some imaginary war on your iPhone
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   or some imaginary football game with your thumbs
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   or have a relationship with some imaginary woman on some two-dimensional screen.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   You know better than that, right?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   But how many of you keep going back and digging up that bone
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   like a dog returns to its vomit?
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   And God's not mad at you. He just says, "Come here. Come on. See me.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   See me for who I am. I'm not just a just God. I'm a loving God. Come here."
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Therefore,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   since Christ has suffered in the flesh,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   we just talked about how he suffered in the flesh. Why?
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Because he's redeeming you.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   He went to the cross to show his glory and he went to the cross because he's going to redeem you
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   in his glorious state without compromising his nature and his character.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   You know, believe me, just go read Romans 3, 21 through 25.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   It tells you why Christ died.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   For the justice of God.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   And we benefit from that.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   And we know that God's justice has been satisfied so he could love those who are unlovable like me.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   He says, "In light of this, folks, you know this. You know the story, man.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   I've just told you. You're not just wandering around listening to philosophers
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   or people that can tell you where life might be.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   The clouds have rolled back. There is a truth anchored in the heavens
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   that God in his kindness has allowed you to see on earth.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   This isn't just some fable. This is history.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Go back and test it.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Look at Secundus. Look at Tacitus. Look at Josephus.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Look at the testimony of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   They also are eyewitnesses just like the secular historians I've just observed.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   God said this isn't just some poetry that Muhammad threw out for you.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   This is history. It is verifiable.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   You can make sense out of it. It's not nonsense.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   It is true.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   There is an empty tomb, man.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   David talked about it last week.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Because you know that. Arm yourself.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   I love this word, "hoplizo."
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   It's a word that just basically means to make yourself ready, equipped.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   It's the only time it shows up in your New Testament.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   It basically says, "You've got to put this on."
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   You've got to go back again and again to the story that Wagner just walked you through.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Not the philosophy, not the ideas of men,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   but the historical record that can be tested and verified.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   In light of that,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   in light of clothing yourself with that information,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   in light of being informed that God isn't there to rip you off.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   He's there to rescue you and set you free.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   That He's not angry at you.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   That He's burdened by your bondage to sin.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   That you know what's right, but you can't do what's right.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   He says, "Arm yourself with the same purpose."
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   In other words, live just like Jesus did.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Because God exalted Him, gave Him the name above all names.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   At the name of Jesus, every knee will bow, every tongue will confess.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   He is out of the time of suffering.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   He is out of the time of any kind of judgment.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And He is in glory.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Because He lived to honor and please God,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   you should do the same thing.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Because you now know this God that you should learn to love and serve
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   is not there to keep you from having fun.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   He's there to lead you to life.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   He's there to rescue you from the death which comes.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   From doing what seems right to man.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Or from the death that comes,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   that even though man knows the right thing to do, he can't do it.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   You see, He sets you free from the dominion and the power of sin.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   I'm going to give you an illustration for that, that has always been helpful to my life.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   When I was a young man in my 20s,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   who had no prospects of a girlfriend, I bought a dog.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   And word was, they were always your friend.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   And so I said, "Okay, let's go, let's be friends."
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And we spent a lot of time together.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Not as much time as people think.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   I had to teach them some different things.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   And so, your age, there was a Stroh's Beer commercial that was on.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Stroh's Beer, you can Stroh's Beer, right?
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Anyway, something we drank in the 1500s.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   And it was a beer that had this one commercial
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   that this guy had a dog, the dog's name was Alex.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   And this dog would do whatever the guy said.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   And so at one point he actually told Alex, "Go fetch me a cold one."
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   And Alex walked into the kitchen.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   You could hear the refrigerator open and bottles clanking.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And Alex, who had done everything he said in the first 30 seconds of the commercial,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   wasn't coming back in.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   And then all of a sudden you heard this lapping sound.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   And you hear the commercial closes with,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   "Alex, that better be your water, alright?"
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   And the idea is this dog will obey everything he says
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   when he goes to fetch a cold one.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   He can't help but drink it himself.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   That was the idea of the commercial.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   And so I thought to myself,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   "I wonder if you could teach a dog to do this."
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Now Caleb knew about 30 different things.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   He was a great hunting dog.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   We had all kinds of hand signals worked out.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   I actually used him when I went to speak.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   At the time I wasn't a guy that was imbibing the stroes.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   I wasn't a guy that felt like that was the right thing for me to do
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   because of the kind of folks I was hanging out and working with.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   But I did like diet Mountain Dew.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Actually, I like straight Mountain Dew.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   The diet came a little later.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   If I was naked, I would be ashamed before you because of it.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   [Laughter]
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   And so anyway, I tried to teach Caleb, okay, to go.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   I'm going to fetch me a cold one.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   This is what this dog could do.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   I'd say, "Fetch me a cold one."
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   If folks were over at my house, it was a great party trick.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   He would walk in the kitchen.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   I had a sock tied around my kitchen refrigerator handle.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   He would pull the sock.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   He would nose it open.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   He would get in there, and down there was the Mountain Dew.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   He would pull it out.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   He would nose it shut.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   He would walk it in, put it at my feet, and sit there.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   And that's how I got married, right?
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   So, like, hey, that's impressive, right?
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   This guy could probably raise kids with me if he can do a dog like that.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   I just sold 2,000 Golden Retrievers right there.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   A bunch of guys rushing out here to buy a dog.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   But anyway, Caleb was my dog, and I was great with Caleb, okay?
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   I tell you this story because it's a lie that you can't teach an old dog new tricks.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   You can.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   If a dog knows what it is that you want it to do and the dog knows that you love it,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   once it understands what you're saying, it'll do whatever you want it to do.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   But let's just say I was an abusive owner.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Let's just say I was an owner that was cruel to Caleb,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   that I thought it was funny that I would take his hunting dummy
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   and would throw it in the middle of the street just to watch him chase it by instinct,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   only to get hit by a car and bloodied up.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   So I could just laugh before my friends at the carnage, you know,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   like some dark snuff film.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   What if I beat him?
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   What if I kicked him?
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   What if I, every time he didn't listen the way I wanted him to,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   I just knocked a tooth out?
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   I was an abusive owner.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   What if somebody walked up to me and watched me abusing that dog?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Let's say I had raised this dog who had been trained by me
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   and spent all kinds of time with me, slept with me.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   The dog did.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   When I got married, that was the one thing my wife said, "The dog is out of the bed."
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Right?
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   I was like, "Fine. No problem." Right?
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   So the dog would lay on the foot of my bed but no longer on the floor.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   I can remember one time my wife and I were kind of getting after each other,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   you know, a couple months after we were married,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   and I called home.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   We had answering machines at the time.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   And I'd just go, "Caleb, Caleb, hey, go kennel up on the bed.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Get on the bed, Caleb. Go get on the bed."
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   She came home, and for the first time since we'd been married,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   the dog is laying on the bed, slobber on the pillow,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   totally angry at the dog until she listened to the messages and heard me.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Then Caleb slept on the bed with her that night,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   and I was on the floor after that.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   But that's how the dog listened to me, okay?
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   The dog listened to me that well, and no fooling.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Okay, but what if somebody watched the abuse?
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Let's say I was an abusive owner, and somebody came to me and just said,
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   "Hey, Todd, how much do you want for that dog?"
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Well, the dog's not for sale.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   No, I want to know how much you want for that dog.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And let's just say they gave me a price that I couldn't resist.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   I mean, put a crazy number on it.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Sold.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   All right, $3 billion.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   $3 billion, all right?
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   So the dog's sold.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   I'm set for life.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Let's just say you've had that dog.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Caleb's in your front yard, and I walk by a week later.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   And that dog, who's for 10 years lived with me, here's my voice,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   here's the whistle that I had for him.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   What do you think that dog's instincts are going to tell?
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   That dog's been set free.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   It's been redeemed, been bought.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   You're now his new master.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   No longer the dominion of me as an abusive master.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   What do you think that dog's going to do when it sees me,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   when it hears my whistle, when it hears my voice?
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Everything in that dog's flesh is going to tremble,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   and it's going to want to blitz out.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   And I'm going to whistle just in time to have it hit by a car again.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Why?
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Is it still my dog?
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Is it still my slave?
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   No, it's been set free.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   But that nature and that flesh is still trained by impulse
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   to listen to this master that sought its destruction.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   And why do I tell you this?
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Because I want you to understand 1 Peter 4, 2 through 6.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   So you can see, you're just like that dog.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Some of you has come to understand really already.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   You're not just here for the first time hearing the story of God's love for you.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   You've really believed it.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   But you haven't learned your new master's voice.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Your flesh hasn't learned to trust his goodness and his kindness yet,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   and you're still not sure that God is good.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   You're still listening to that old master who told you there is no God,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   or if a God is there, he's there to rip you off, not set you free.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   And so you still hear the whistle of bar rooms.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   You still hear the whistle of anorexia or excessive diets or affirmation by men.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   You still hear the whistle of bondage to pornography.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   You still hear the whistle of numbing your pain.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   The way the world offers to numb pain.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   And even though your master says you don't have to do that anymore,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   there's life somewhere else, you're going to keep running there
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   unless you learn to meditate on the goodness of God
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   and focus on the goodness of God.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   And why do you want to do that?
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Because all your dog buddies that used to watch you be devastated and ravaged by sin
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   because you had a master who was abusive over you,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   is no longer your master.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   And now all of a sudden there's a good and loving master that redeems you.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   And all the other dogs that are still owned by me need to know
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   that there really is a good and loving master out there
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   who has an infinite supply of billions to redeem them
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   if they would just say, "Have you shopped me lately?"
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   And then the analogy breaks down then because the truth is we've been bought with a price
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   and God set us all free.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   None of us have to live with that abusive owner anymore.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   And there are a bunch of dogs that are still slaves that need to see you've been set free.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Now watch this.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Watch this.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   It says, "Arm yourself with the truth of the kindness of God
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   because he suffered in the flesh.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   He ceased from sin."
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   In other words, the one who is no longer listening to their flesh's urging
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   to go after that familiar voice.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   And sometimes it is hard not to listen to the familiar voice of the world.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Some of you guys have trained yourself for two decades
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   to do nothing but listen to the voice of the world and the lusts of your flesh.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   That's all you've ever listened to.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Your body has literally hardwired itself to be pleasured in certain ways
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   and to desire certain things.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   And so when it calls and it pulls, you're not suffering in your flesh.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   You're just going along with your flesh,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   and you keep running out into the street of destruction.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   And yet you're somebody who's supposed to know the kindness and goodness of God,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   and a bunch of other dogs who are still in bondage to this terrible master
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   are wondering if you ever knew a good master who set you free.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Oh, that other master might as well love you either
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   because you keep leaving him to go back to the master of death.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   What 1 Peter 4:1 is saying is, "Therefore, since you know the kindness of God,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   you suffer in your flesh the way that Jesus, who knew the kindness of God,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   was willing to go to a cross because he knew that God was going to permit
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   what he did not love in order to create what he did love,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   suffering in his Son in order to make provision for you and me and for us."
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   He's saying, "Hey, listen, Todd, your flesh, when you trust me, your flesh is not dead.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   You know, there's no program in your Bible, none, to reform your flesh.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   We are called to die to our flesh.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   We say the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   We say I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   I'm not really dead. My flesh isn't dead, but I consider it dead by faith.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   I don't listen anymore to the whistling calls of the world.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   I don't listen to the lies of the enemy that says God's not good,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   and I don't listen to my flesh, which is conformed to humanity, which is broken.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   But I have another master now whose voice says, "You don't have to listen to that, Todd.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   I know it's strong. I know the pull is there."
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   You guys ever get that? Like, if God loves me so much, why did he create me to love sin so much?
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Answer, he didn't create you to love sin.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   But you're part of the downline of humanity, which has chosen to rebel against God.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   And what God is doing is he's calling--now, watch this, 1 Peter 2, 9.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   "For you are a royal priesthood."
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   You are a holy nation.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   You are a people for God's own possession,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   because you have been called out of the darkness into his marvelous light
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   so that you might proclaim his excellencies.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   In other words, you don't have this abusive owner anymore.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Everybody in the world is an abusive owner.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   There's one righteous owner with more than a billion dollars' worth of assets.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   He's got the eternal blood and provision of God to rescue people from the wages of sin.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   He sets you free. Now you're across the street in the kingdom of God.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Why do you keep running out into the middle of the street and dying like all the other dogs?
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Why is your flesh not suffering?
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Your flesh keeps running to lower Greenville.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Your flesh keeps running to elicit relationships and pornography.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Why?
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Answer, "Because I'm not arming myself, reminding myself of the kindness of God."
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   That's 1 Peter 4, 1.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   It says in 4, 2, it says, "So as to the rest of the time,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   "in the flesh is no longer for the lusts of men, but now for the will of God."
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   You guys ever done this?
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Dying well is not easy, is it?
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   You think about people who die well, maybe die nobly.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   You ever think about that?
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   There's all kinds of stories about somebody comes in the room, the doors are locked, guns come out,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   and they say, "Who's really a Christian?"
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   "I'm going to kill you."
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   If you stand up and maybe let's just say a few bold people step into the world,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Rachel Scott's of the world, go, "I'm a Christian."
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Boom, dead.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   You go, "Wow, she died well."
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   You know what I think is even harder than dying well and nobly in the midst of immediate threat of execution?
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   It's living well.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   I think as hard as dying well is, the easiest thing for me to do is to profess Christ,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   and then not just to be baptized, but to be executed.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   I think I could be convinced of the kindness of God and so sure of my salvation.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   I'm like, "Look, if I'm going to trust God, and I'm going to die right now and go to glory,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   I'll bet everything on that.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   But how about this?
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Okay, no, I'm going to let you live, and I'm going to let you live when the world seduces you
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   and your flesh craves things and the enemy lies to you,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   and I want you to live not as a slave to your flesh,
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   not as a person who's seduced by the world, not a person who listens to lies."
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   That is not easy to do.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   But it's what godly people do.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   It's what 1 Peter is begging you to do.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   The time that you live right now, we don't live according to the lusts of men.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   That's not other men. That's us.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   Because we know that our flesh thought things were right,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   and haven't we all learned that our flesh isn't right?
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   Haven't we all done what our flesh said?
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   "This would be a good idea."
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   We go, "No, it's got guilt and shame and scars written all over it."
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   I was a fool. I didn't learn from wise men who had committed the same mistakes and had the same scars.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   I had to go get scarred up myself.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   I had to make that my story.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   But now I've learned.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   And so he's saying, "Now that you've learned, man, okay, you've seen the wickedness of sin and the life of God.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Let's live for the will of God."
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Let me just give you a decent cross-reference.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   One of the things I love about your Bible is your Bible's not confusing.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   It's a bunch of writers.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   They're all saying the same thing because they're inspired by the same Holy Spirit.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   This is 1 John 2.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Let me read this to you, and then we'll tackle the rest of 1 Peter.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Watch this.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   "My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin."
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   The reason we don't want to sin is not because if we sin, God's going to judge us.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   No, we've already, if we trusted in Christ, been set free from sin's decree,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   which is if you sin, you die.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   You go, "God, I deserve to die because I was a rebel just like Satan."
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   You did what?
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Christ is who?
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   He's God?
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   He died for me?
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   The just for me?
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   The unjust?
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   In order that he might bring me to God?
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   You died for my sins, past, present, and future?
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   I'm no longer a victim of my own rebellion?
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   That's right, Todd.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And not only that, but you don't have to listen to sin anymore because sin told you that I was not a good God.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Sin told you that you could find life apart from me.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   But I've shown you now in history that you can only find life with me.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   I'm not just just.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   I'm loving and merciful and gracious.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   I give you what you don't deserve, and I withhold from you what you do deserve.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Come learn from me.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   You don't have to listen anymore to your flesh, which is Adam's lineage.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Listen to Jesus, who is my son.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   John had just written that same story.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   He said, I'm writing these things so that you may not sin.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Not so that you would lose your salvation.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   You can't do that if you trusted in your good shepherd.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   But so that you wouldn't be scarred by it.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   And if anyone sins, this is what he's going to say.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   We've got an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   He himself is the propitiation, the appropriate sacrifice.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   That's what that word means.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Not just for ours, but for the whole world and anybody who wants to trust in the goodness of God.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   By this we know that we've come to know him.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   Oh, man, let's pay due right here.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Guess what he's going to say.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   1 Peter 4, 1-6.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   How do you know if you love God?
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Let's go.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   By this we know that you have come to know him, if we keep his commandments.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   You're free, man.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   You no longer have to live in the street of destruction, despair, and idiot owners who roll balls out in the street.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   And our nature wants to go and get them so he can laugh at our destruction.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   No, now we're still free to chase balls if we want, but we know that that ball is leading to death.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   And so we're free to sit there because we know there's a better way than trusting our flesh.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Because our master says, "Don't go. Don't chase that ball.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Hey, that's the wrong ball. Hey, look at me.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Chase this ball.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   At the end of this ball, all right, is a fillet. Go chase that one. Go."
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Still get to chase balls.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   We just find life there and not death.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Listen to me. I know that voice is familiar to you.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   I know you've listened to a liar for a long time, but listen to me.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Learn from me.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Are you weary? Are you heavy laden by listening to the lie?
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Listen to me. The way you know that you know that God is good is you listen to the voice of the God that you know is good.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Are you all tracking with me?
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   It's 1 John. It's 1 Peter.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   And what he says right here, watch this, follow this, by this we've come to know that we know him if we keep his commandments.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   The one that says, "I've come to know him," and does not keep his commandments is a liar.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   In other words, man, if you go, "I can't not sin. I can't stop doing this."
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Oh, yes, you can.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   If you knew the goodness and what you do is you love you more than God because really maybe your problem is not Satan.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Maybe your problem is just you. You've enthroned yourself.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   You think you know better than God.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   You've eaten of the tree of good and evil, and you think what's good is good, and you're going to do what seems good.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   And you're going to say, "Hey, if it feels good to me, why don't I do it?
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Why would God make me this way and not let me do it?"
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Well, because he didn't make you that way. Sin did, and sin will kill you.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   [Mumbling]
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   [Laughter]
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   And I just say to my friends, "Man, if you like what you got, keep doing what you're doing.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   If you like your master, keep following him.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   But I'm going to tell you, if you keep following that master, you're not going to like what you get.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   Can I show you the scars? I chased that same ball. I listened to that same master.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   Can I tell you how God picked me up and taught me a better way?
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   That voice still is attractive to me, but it's now overpowered with another voice I've come to know so well.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   This is what it says then a little bit later in that same chapter.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   "Don't love the world or the things of the world.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life."
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   See also Genesis 3, the same words that were there.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   They're not from the Father, but they're from the world.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   The world's passing away, and also it's lust.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   But the one who does the will of God will live forever,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   because this world that is Satan's home and sin's dominion, God's going to say, "That's enough."
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   There's going to be a day when he's going to come to judge the living and the dead,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   and say, "There's not going to be any more of this stuff. We're going to put it away forever.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   I've shown my justice. I've shown that I'm a loving and merciful God.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   It's time to live in the kingdom."
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   Now you that know that there's a king that's coming to do that,
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   what he says is, "Would you please live in this world that is a slave to the king of sin,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   as if you know another king, like an alien.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   You're not ruled by the king of this world. You're ruled by the kingdom of God.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   You're ruled by the God who is sovereign over this world.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   Would you trust him? Because the rest of the world needs to know there's another voice they can listen to.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   They need to see the life that you found. They need to see the freedom that is available.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   If you run after what they run after, then it looks like you don't have a king that loves you.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   You look like they do.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   May it never be that those who have been reconciled to God look like those who do not know his kindness.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   There's been enough time for that. Now's the time to live for the will of God.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   For the time already passed, it says in verse 3,
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   "It's sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles,
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   having pursued a course of sensuality, lust, drunkenness, carousing, drinking, partying, and abominable idolatries."
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Do you guys love the movie "Princess Bride"? Yeah, we love it. Good. Thank you. So do I.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   I love the movie. I haven't seen it in forever, but it's one of those movies that we all know the lines.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   There's that great moment when Vincenni has been chased by the Dread Pirate Roberts.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   Actually, it's not the Dread Pirate Roberts. We know that now.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   But it's Wesley who's coming after his dear Princess Buttercup who has been stolen.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   Every time he thinks he loses them, he goes, "That's inconceivable." Right?
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   He keeps saying, "That's inconceivable."
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   Finally, when they make it up that great cliff in Nego Montoya, and I wish I had a better accent,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   after hearing this for about the 50th time, he goes, "That's inconceivable." Right?
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   He goes, "You keep using that word.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   I do not think that word means what you think it means." Right?
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Can I tell you guys, that's kind of what the world and your friends are saying.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   If you say you know the kindness and the love of God, and yet you keep on giving yourself away.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   I can't tell you how many times I've talked to girls who are sleeping with their boyfriends,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   and they go, "I just want them to know Jesus.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   I don't know why he won't believe me when I tell him God is good."
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   I go, "Because I don't think you know what that word means, that God is good.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Because you keep listening to the same master your boyfriend is listening to,
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   who doesn't think that God is good.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   He thinks God is trying to rip him off, including not have moments of ecstasy and pleasure with you.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   Never mind the guilt and the shame.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   Never mind the fact that he knows that's not the way to build a good relationship.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   It's all about him.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   And why would he live in a way that's all about him?
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   Because he doesn't know there's a God worth living for.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   And you're trying to introduce him to a God that's worth living for?
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Who's good and kind and righteous in all his ways?
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   I do not think you know what that word means.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Because you don't listen.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   It's inconceivable that you would know the love of God.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   And not that you wouldn't slip up at times.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   That's 1 John.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   It's okay.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   He died for our slip-ups.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   But somebody that says he knows that God is good and continually, as a matter of practice,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   ignores the voice of God and goes his own way,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   I don't think they know who the goodness of God is.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   God's not mad at them, but they're deluded.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   Do you know what's supposed to change people?
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   When your friends go, "How come you're not chasing all the balls we always used to chase together?"
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   "How come you don't listen to him when he intimidates you and tells you he's going to kick your face in
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   if you don't do what he tells you to do?"
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   "That your life's going to be miserable if you don't listen to him?"
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Answer, "Because I've been redeemed, man.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   I've got a different master."
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   There's a great story of Augustine.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   He's an early church father.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Augustine was walking down the street when he was converted.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   Augustine was not this guy that was raised in Sunday school.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   Augustine was a guy that was a lecherous human.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   He stole just for the pleasure of stealing, and he had pleasure just for the pleasure of pleasure.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   He was walking down the street, and one of his old lovers saw him and said,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   "Augustine, it is me."
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Augustine, his recorder, said, "Yes, but it is no longer I."
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   He kept on walking.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   People looked and said, "Who is this guy that no longer listens to the whistle?"
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Let me just bring this to an updated deal.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Like Augustine was living today.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   He gets pinged on a text, "Augustine, do you want to watch Netflix and chill?"
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   He would say, "Do you want to come over and read the Word of God and live?"
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   Because, man, every time you got that text before that said, "Let's watch Netflix and chill,"
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   you were like, "Be right there."
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   That master said, "Roll that ball," and you were driving.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Right?
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   But all of a sudden, you're into something better.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   I know I could go over there and have a moment of intense pleasure,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   but I also know it's going to be wracked with pain, maybe lead to murder.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   Oh, God, give me the strength.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Remind me that this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   and your commandments are not burdensome.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   You know what the burden was, Lord?
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   The burden was guilt.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   The burden was lies.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   The burden was deceit.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   The burden was me having no respect for myself.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   That was the burden, God.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   Oh, deliver me from this body of death.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   Scripture says in verse 4, "In all this, they," your old friends, "they are surprised."
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   It's right there.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   It's "xenizo."
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   It's a word that you guys, when all this stuff with Trump is going on right now,
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   with the wall and we're going to ban certain people in certain countries,
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   you've heard the word, "You're a xenophobe."
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   You guys heard that?
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Okay, a xenophobe.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   You know what a xenophobe is?
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   A xenophobe is somebody who has an unhealthy fear or dislike for strangers
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   or people from a foreign land.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   It's a xenophobe, X-E-N-O-phobia.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   It comes from the word right here.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   Some of your Bibles, if you're reading a different translation, will say, "They think it's strange."
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   They look at you and they go, "That ain't normal, man."
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   "How come you're not the girl you used to be?
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   Something's changed.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   How come you don't--?"
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   That is weird.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   And you know what the world does when it sees somebody that lives for another world,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   a world it doesn't recognize yet, that's still in bondage to deceit and sin?
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   They will malign you.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   They will go, "Oh, like my sons.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   My sons won't look at porn."
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   And so they're called homosexual, right?
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   Because they won't take the phone when it's passed around.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   Do they want to?
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   Absolutely.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Even as young men that have been raised in a home to learn about the kindness and the goodness of God,
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   their dad wants to look at it.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   My flesh is like, "Go, baby. Chase that ball."
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   But we go, "No, no, no."
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   Because that's going to hardwire our flesh to make it even harder to say no the next time that ball is rolled.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   And I don't want to go there because I know what that leads to.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   I know it leads to sexual dysfunction.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   I know it leads to addiction.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   I know it's worse than cocaine and heroin, scientifically proven.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   It's just I don't want that.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   Oh, I want it, but I don't want that.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   Deliver me from this body of death.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Lord, help me not to give in to fleshly lusts which wage war against my soul.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   Can I tell you something?
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   Now, listen to me on this, okay?
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   You ready?
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   Guys, you don't have a soul.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Biblically, you don't have a soul.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   You are a soul.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   You have a body.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   The body which you have right now has been marred by sin because it's part of the lineage of Adam,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   but God has put in you and taught your soul the truth.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   The life which you now live, you live not in the flesh, but by faith in the Son of God who loves you.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   Why? Because you're not conformed to the ways of the world,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   but you're being transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   You have armed yourself with 1 Peter 3:18 and all the truth of it
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   and the kindness of God that has rescued you from bondage to sin and death.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   And so this soul which is trapped in a world that's still ruled by a rebellion against God
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   and a deceiver who is the spirit over in a flesh that is marred by sin,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   you don't have to listen to anymore because what's inside of you is the power of God,
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   a right understanding of God which keeps you from listening to everything that the world listens to.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   And guess what the world does when your flesh doesn't do what their flesh does?
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   It maligns you because it's convicted by you.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   It blasphemes you.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   It says you're self-righteous.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   It says that you're intolerant of other people's choices.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   And you just say, "Man, I'm just trying to live this way."
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   "And I'm telling you I live that way. There's life over here."
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   That's what the word means right there in 1 Peter 4 which is in all this.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   They're surprised. They're xenophobes.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   That you don't run with them into the same excesses of dissipation and they blasphemo.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   They malign you. They heap abuse on you.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   "What's wrong, man? You're a prude? You're scared of God? You got a guilty conscience?"
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   "No, man. No. I'm just guilty because I've sinned against God."
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   "And God's not mad at me. I used to think God had a rule book and I had to follow it if He was ever going to love me."
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   "And I've seen that when I am with someone like God, just like you, I want that stuff still."
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   "I'm not better than you. I see how broken I am. I've done those things, man."
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   "And even more, I know the kindness of God and I still want to do those things."
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   "What kind of nut am I?"
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   "I say, 'Be thou my vision,' and yet I want to go chase these things to death."
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   "But all I am, man, I'm a guy who by the grace of God has come to know His kindness."
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   He says they're going to malign you, verse 5, but.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   Alright, when you see a but, you're supposed to stand back and look at it.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   And ask yourself, why is it there in the text, okay?
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   And so what's happening here is a shift, okay?
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   There's a shift.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   That's one of those excerpts that idiots on YouTube will go, "Listen to what Wagner said, man. Come hear this guy."
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   But listen to me. You see a but, okay, why is it there?
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   Something's about to happen. I know you're getting beat up.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   I know the girl's mocking you.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   I know she's saying, "Why won't you come have Netflix and chill?"
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   I know why your buddies are going, "Oh, what's happening, man? Lost the libido? What's going on, man?"
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   And what you're just going to do is you just say, "But, I mean, here's the truth."
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   "They will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead."
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   That's a humbling verse.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   Verse 6 continues this, "For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are dead."
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   "That though they are judged in the flesh as men, they may live in the Spirit according to the will of God."
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   And all he's saying is, "Hey, listen, hang in there, okay?"
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   "You're not the first person this has happened to."
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   In Acts, we have Paul in Acts chapter 26 and verse 24.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   Felix is talking to Paul, and Paul's talking about living for God.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   He goes, "You've lost your mind. You're out of your mind. Are you crazy?"
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   Jesus, in Mark 3, 24, is told that his family came for him, and they said he is beside himself.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   He's no longer in his right mind.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   And they beheaded Paul. They crucified Jesus.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   They've tortured saints throughout all of time, but guess what?
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   Though they have died, they live in the Spirit.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   This is Jesus in Matthew chapter 10, in verse 28.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   He says, "Do not fear those who can kill the body."
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   Remember, you don't have a soul.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   You are a soul, and you have a body.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   And this body, this corrupt body, is going to be sown into the ground and raised to newness of life.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   And all that's going on in 1 Peter 4, 6, is he's saying, "Hey, listen, man.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   Don't get overwhelmed. I know it's hard, but they're going to give an account for mocking God."
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   He is ready to judge, and the only reason he hasn't judged yet is because there's some folks at the porch on April 25, 2017,
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   that he hopes see his kindness and his goodness again.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   So before he rolls up history, someone else trusts in God's kindness.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   They're sick and tired of listening to abusive owners.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   He's done more than 3 billion. He's spilled out the precious, eternal blood of God.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   And so you keep getting suffering.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   You're suffering even if no one throws rocks or hurls insults at you.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   You're suffering because your flesh still wants to sin.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   Don't be discouraged about that. Your flesh is always going to want to sin.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   Be encouraged that you're no longer a slave to your sin.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   If you appropriate the power of God, the benefit of community, and yieldedness to the Holy Spirit.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   These guys were judging the flesh by men to be worthy of death.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   But don't worry. The God who lives has said they're worthy of honor.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   And to be part of the kingdom of God forever.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   This is Peter reviewing 1 Peter 2, 21-23.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   You ready?
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   The "therefore" of 1 Peter 4, 1 is spilled out earlier in 1 Peter 2, 21-23.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   "For Christ suffered for you."
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   He left an example for you to follow in his steps.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   "Who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in his mouth."
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   "And while being reviled, he didn't revile in return, and while he suffered he did not utter threats."
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   "But he kept entrusting himself to the one who judges rightly."
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   And folks, that's our hope, man.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   Your flesh is going to mock you, the enemy is going to mock you, the world is going to mock you.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   And you say, "Okay, man. I've made my decision. I'm going to follow the one who gave his life for me."
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   "Not the one who laughs when I get scarred again. Not the one who takes pleasure in seeing me destroyed."
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   Here's what you do.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   First thing is you stay humble.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   You remember, and this is going to take two minutes, you stay humble.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   You remember that you did not come to God because you were raised in church, you were some perfect little saint.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   No. Titus 3-3.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   "For we were once foolish ourselves." Right? Amen? Porch?
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   Disobedient.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   We were deceived.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   Todd Widener was enslaved. Enslaved to various lusts and pleasures.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   I spent my life in malice and envy. I was hateful, hating one another.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   But by the grace of God, man, the kindness of God appeared to me.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   In Jesus Christ, my Savior, and His love for mankind appeared to me.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   I saw it for the first time.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   Someone told me, "Hey, this is not a rule book that beats you up over the head."
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   "This is a love story. This is history. Go test it, bro."
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   "There really was a guy named David. There really was a Pilate. There really was a Jesus."
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   "There really was a cross. And the tomb is really empty."
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   You know why? Because it's true.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   And this whole time you've been living in rebellion, you've been following the way of the world,
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   and the lies of the world.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   And He saved you, Todd Widener, not according to deeds which you have ever done in righteousness,
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   but according to His mercy. Do you see it?
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   What's God showing through this corrupt, broken world we're living in?
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   The mercy of God.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   By the washing of the regeneration of the power of God,
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   and the renewing of the Holy Spirit, you stay humble.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   The second thing you do is you stay holy.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   That's 1 Peter 4, 1-6.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   That's why you're here. To be holy. To live holy lives amidst a dark and perverse generation.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   Why? Because if you're running after the same ball they are, and getting hit by the same car as they do,
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   it looks like you have no master. It's a figment of your imagination.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   No, you cling to Jesus.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   You remember the kindness of God.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   You honor Him. You listen to Him.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   You don't get conformed to the ways of this world, but you are being transformed.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   Not just on Tuesday nights, but in your study every day, in your community groups,
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   when you gather with the saints, and you say, "Be thou my vision."
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   Oh God.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   You stay holy. Why? Because God wants others to know there's a master who can set them free.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   And so how you live matters, church.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   I mean, you're saved if you've trusted in Christ.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   Your Jesus died for you, but He wants you to live for Him because He loves people like you,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   being ravaged by sin.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   You be bold. You preach that gospel.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   You go tell people that this life is not all there is, that there is more,
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   and that they are a soul with a body, and this body is marred by sin,
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   and God's going to raise it to newness of life.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   And you be happy.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   You chase the balls God throws, and I'm going to tell you something, man.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   It will set you free.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   I am going to tell you this. I am 30 years older than you.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   I started walking with Christ about your age, and I am happy.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   I am blessed by God.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   The wife of my youth loves me and respects me.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   I have six kids who, though I'm imperfect in the home, love me and respect me as a father.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   Our home is intact. We work through conflict.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   We laugh together. We seek good together.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   We serve others together.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   I am at peace with my God and with my family, and God is using me for his good.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   I have purpose and forgiveness and meaning and love.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   Be happy.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   This is the kindness of God, that we keep his commandments,
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   and his commandments are not burdensome. Amen?
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   Father God, would you convince them it's true?
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   We, Lord, I don't know how come we're here. I don't know why.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   You pushed us here to hear this message, and maybe some of us have even believed it.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   I don't know why, Lord, but we want to be humble, and we don't want to act like we're better than anybody else.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   We don't scoff at people that are somewhere getting $2 shots on some dead Tuesday night
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   that they're trying to make alive by offering a bargain.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   We're just shocked it's not us.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   And, Lord, we want to be holy. We want them to look at us and go,
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   "Why aren't you listening to that lover's call anymore?"
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   It's because we've heard a real lover who gave us a real call.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   And so we want to be bold to talk about the goodness of our master who has set us free
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   from the master of sin and death, who told us there was life places that we have drunk from,
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   only to find out he was a liar indeed.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   And, Lord, we thank you for the kindness that comes
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   as we live your way and live a holy life.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   Blessed.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   So, Lord, teach us now. Take these hands.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   I know they're empty, but with you they can.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   Use us for your glory. Let us sing in Jesus' name. Amen.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:23.500]   Amen.
