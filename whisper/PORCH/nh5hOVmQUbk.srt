1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,160
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,740
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,320
 (upbeat music)

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:37,140
 - All right, Forge, how we doing?

6
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,900
 We doing okay?

7
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,740
 It's good to see you.

8
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,180
 Welcome back, week two.

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,620
 It's been an amazing night already.

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,840
 I'm really looking forward to where we're going

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,060
 this evening and I'm really glad you're here for it.

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,140
 Genuinely, I believe this every week

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,160
 and yet there's just something in my soul tonight

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,840
 that thinks God has something special in store.

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,840
 Before we get going, it wouldn't be a typical Tuesday

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,260
 or a regular night at the porch if we didn't say hey

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,640
 to some special friends that are tuning in with us online.

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,020
 So, special shout out to all of our Porch Live locations

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,380
 that are tuning in with us wherever it is you are.

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,440
 Will y'all put your hands together for Porch Live?

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,740
 Yes, we love the Porch Live.

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,300
 Special shout out to Porch Live Wheaton,

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,420
 Fort Worth and Fresno.

24
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,040
 Man, I love the fact that God is not just doing

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,180
 something here, he is doing something in other places

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,780
 as well and we're a part of it.

27
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,620
 Like sometimes we can get trapped in our moment

28
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,560
 here in Dallas and think that God's really working here

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,820
 but what we need to know is, man,

30
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,940
 we're a part of a greater movement

31
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,400
 which is happening all over, I mean really,

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,100
 it's happening all over the world

33
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,040
 and it's an incredible gift that we get to be a part of.

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,560
 So, love the fact that we're here,

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,260
 really excited for tonight but to set things up,

36
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,260
 I'd love to just start with a quick story

37
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,680
 and I'd like to try and help out some of my brothers

38
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,920
 in the room and do you a solid in the event

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,880
 that no one ever has.

40
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,900
 So, if you're a guy in the room,

41
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,820
 then I just wanna look at you and tell you straight up

42
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,920
 that the minute a woman enters your world,

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,260
 it's going to fundamentally flip upside down.

44
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,820
 Like everything is going to change for you.

45
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,720
 I know this was my experience.

46
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,020
 When Brooke and I got married, I was 25 years old,

47
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,240
 meaning that I had a quarter century of life

48
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,300
 under my belt by this point.

49
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,820
 Like I felt pretty confident in my ability

50
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,480
 to navigate the ways of paying my bills

51
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,540
 and getting my groceries and providing for my needs.

52
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,820
 I wasn't super settled in my ways but I was comfortable.

53
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,020
 Like I felt really good, really confident

54
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,540
 about the way that I was walking through the world,

55
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,860
 navigating my reality.

56
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,300
 That is until we eventually moved in together.

57
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,420
 You see, but before we did,

58
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,460
 Brooke and I, we went in and we got an apartment.

59
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,380
 She moved in first.

60
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,220
 I waited until we said the I do's and then we came together

61
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,580
 but she moved in first because she wanted to nest.

62
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,340
 You see, ladies like to take a house

63
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,780
 and make it into a home, which I was great with

64
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,580
 only until I realized that upon moving in,

65
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,540
 she wasn't just making a house into a home.

66
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,980
 She was actually gonna take a simple man

67
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,380
 and make him into a family man.

68
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,060
 Because when I moved in after we got married,

69
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,420
 what I learned is the dryer was not a suitable place

70
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,580
 to store my clothing.

71
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,040
 Guys, anybody willing to admit that that's what you do?

72
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,020
 Like your clothes are sitting in the dryer in this moment.

73
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,860
 Don't do it.

74
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,300
 It's not gonna work for her

75
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,980
 because she's gonna want it all folded and hung up

76
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,940
 and sorted appropriately.

77
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,380
 I realized pretty early on

78
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,140
 that my meals couldn't simply consist of the chicken rice

79
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,080
 that I had prepped the week before.

80
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,960
 Tupperware wasn't suitable serving where instead,

81
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,900
 we were gonna follow whatever recipe

82
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,300
 Half-Baked Harvest had recommended at that time.

83
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,220
 I don't know about you, but I know for myself,

84
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,260
 my come and take it flag was sufficient decor

85
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,460
 to be pinned on my wall.

86
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,180
 Any guys with some flags hung in their apartments

87
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,300
 or townhomes or bedrooms right now?

88
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,420
 It's not suitable decor.

89
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,220
 Like when you get married and you move in,

90
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,080
 she's going to want to frame photographs and hang artwork

91
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,160
 because she is going to try to actually make you into more

92
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,860
 than you are right now.

93
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,540
 She's going to want to make you into a family man.

94
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,000
 You see, I felt like the minute she and I got married,

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,100
 everything changed for me.

96
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,260
 Like my whole way of thinking was confronted to the core.

97
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,360
 My whole way of feeling was like called out and called up.

98
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,300
 My way of doing was challenged forever.

99
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,640
 Now, if you asked me, Kylan, do you regret it?

100
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,160
 I would say no.

101
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,380
 I actually recommend marriage.

102
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,460
 I think it's pretty great.

103
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,460
 You see, I realized that there were some old ways

104
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,920
 of doing things that I needed to unlearn.

105
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,060
 And yet there were some new and better ways

106
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,100
 of doing things that I needed to learn instead.

107
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,180
 Now, why do I tell you all of that?

108
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,220
 Because some of you are here tonight,

109
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,500
 and if you're honest, you feel like this is your current

110
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,020
 state of circumstance.

111
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,740
 Instead, you're not trying to figure out

112
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,800
 how you should behave at home.

113
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,720
 You're trying to figure out what you should believe at heart.

114
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,160
 Like some of us feel like our old way of doing things

115
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,120
 spiritually are no longer working.

116
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,000
 And so we're wondering if there's a better way

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,360
 of doing things instead.

118
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,680
 If that's you, then I'm really grateful you're here

119
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,180
 and excited to tell you that this series is meant for you.

120
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,480
 Because over the course of the next five weeks,

121
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,160
 we want to help rebuild your spiritual reality.

122
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,320
 Like we want to reboot your belief.

123
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,240
 We want to help you reconstruct whatever it feels like

124
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,080
 is deconstructed.

125
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,740
 And it's not because we're just trying to generate

126
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,760
 some clickbait, like pick a subject that's going to

127
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,680
 have a lot of hype.

128
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,680
 It's really because we want to be helpful.

129
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,580
 We want to be helpful.

130
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,920
 We know that this idea of deconstruction

131
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,440
 is massively widespread within our generation.

132
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,760
 So we want to attack it head on.

133
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,080
 And yet in order for us to do that,

134
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,700
 what we have to do is we have to set a really firm

135
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,000
 foundation because you can't construct something

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,600
 unless you have a good basis to build on.

137
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,580
 It makes me think of several years ago

138
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,040
 when I was at the beach with my niece.

139
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,840
 My niece, she wanted to build a sand castle,

140
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,800
 which I'm all about.

141
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,840
 That sounds like a great time.

142
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,600
 And so she pulls out her sand tools and her sand toys

143
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,720
 and her castle cups and we start packing sand

144
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,160
 in those things.

145
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,320
 And she's turned them over and sets them down.

146
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,960
 And what she realizes is every time she flips the cup,

147
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,800
 the structure's not standing.

148
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,880
 Because she didn't know that she should clear the sand

149
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,000
 and level a foundation.

150
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,240
 That's what we have to do.

151
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,880
 Before we get into this idea of deconstructing

152
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,160
 and really evaluating how we rebuild our reality,

153
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,260
 we have to lay a good foundation to build on,

154
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,460
 which is what we're going to do here tonight.

155
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,320
 So where do we start?

156
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,420
 What's the right place to begin

157
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,280
 in the work of rebuilding reality?

158
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,680
 I think we need to establish a really good working

159
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,480
 definition for deconstruction,

160
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,200
 because I don't know about you,

161
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,160
 but in my world, as I've done research,

162
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,560
 what I've found is people fall in all manner

163
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,120
 of different places when it comes to this topic.

164
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,560
 You see, some people look at deconstruction

165
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,080
 and they treat it as more of an intellectual renovation

166
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,560
 of sorts, like you take one thing from your life

167
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,400
 and you're just trying to freshen it up a little bit.

168
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,040
 Other people, they look at deconstruction

169
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,840
 and it's really synonymous with disenchantment.

170
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,280
 Like I used to believe that,

171
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,060
 man, it's just not really working for me anymore.

172
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,480
 While others look at deconstruction

173
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,560
 and they equate it to demolition.

174
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,120
 That I'm not just trying to overhaul a couple of things

175
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,040
 with respect to my faith.

176
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,560
 I'm trying to blow everything up with respect to my faith.

177
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,220
 People, they fall all over the grid

178
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,560
 with respect to their understanding of deconstruction.

179
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,400
 And I'm sure that's the case for some of us here tonight.

180
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,180
 And the reason for that is because deconstruction

181
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,180
 is notoriously difficult to understand

182
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,960
 if you actually go back to its origin.

183
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,920
 I don't know if you knew this,

184
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,780
 but deconstruction is not a new thing.

185
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,260
 It actually was created by a French philosopher

186
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,840
 named Jacques Derrida in the 1960s.

187
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,620
 He was a young adult himself,

188
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,360
 and he created this concept

189
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,520
 that even he was unwilling to summarize

190
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,600
 when asked how to explain it

191
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,760
 because it is annoyingly nuanced.

192
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,800
 Just take my word for it.

193
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,120
 If you want more information,

194
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,440
 you can come talk to me down to the front

195
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,520
 at the end of our service.

196
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,320
 And yet, because we're going to be spending

197
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,480
 the next five weeks on this,

198
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,360
 we need to come up with some kind of definition.

199
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,700
 So I have done the hard work of figuring out a definition

200
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,540
 that will work for us.

201
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,080
 Are you ready for it?

202
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,200
 It's nothing original to me.

203
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,360
 It was actually quoted by a guy named Brian Zand

204
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,920
 in his book, "When Everything Catches Fire."

205
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,040
 And this is what he said.

206
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,880
 He said, "Deconstruction is a crisis of faith

207
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,020
 "that leads to either a reevaluation of Christianity

208
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,840
 "or sometimes a total abandonment of Christianity."

209
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,220
 Meaning the process of deconstruction

210
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,220
 doesn't begin with dismantling your belief.

211
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,840
 The process of deconstruction

212
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,900
 begins with doubting your belief.

213
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,300
 That's the precursor.

214
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,220
 That's where things have to begin.

215
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,900
 And the reality is most people that say,

216
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,180
 "I'm deconstructing,"

217
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,820
 they're really just wrestling with doubt.

218
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,340
 And so that's what I want us to talk about tonight.

219
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,220
 You see, often when we hear the idea of doubt,

220
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,640
 when it comes to the faith,

221
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,700
 we assume that means a really bad thing.

222
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,180
 And yet, I actually think within doubt,

223
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,600
 there's a really great opportunity.

224
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,580
 So let me explain it to you like this.

225
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,440
 When Brooke and I were in the market to buy a house

226
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,720
 after first moving here to Dallas,

227
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,900
 we knew that we wanted to buy a place

228
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,940
 that needed some renovations.

229
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,780
 We knew it.

230
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,140
 We wanted to invest in a property, increase its value.

231
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,620
 And so as we searched the market,

232
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,260
 we knew we need to find a place

233
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,300
 that is requiring some renovation.

234
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,800
 Now, when we bought our house,

235
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,180
 the house we bought fit the bill.

236
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,720
 It needed to be updated.

237
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,380
 Do you think we walked in

238
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,660
 and just started swinging hammers all over the place?

239
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,980
 No, that would have been very bad

240
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,900
 because as we did a careful evaluation of the property,

241
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,520
 we realized, man, there are certain things here

242
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,460
 that are in great shape,

243
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,460
 but there are other things here that do require attention.

244
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,180
 Upon inspection, there were certain things

245
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,680
 that inspired our confidence to leave them as is,

246
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,140
 but there were other things that upon inspection

247
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,500
 inspired our concern that needed to be addressed.

248
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,220
 That's how we have to approach our faith.

249
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,440
 We have to consider as we carefully evaluate

250
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,380
 what areas of our faith are great as they are.

251
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,720
 We don't need to touch them in the slightest.

252
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,020
 And yet what other areas may feel,

253
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:56,020
 may feel somewhat out of date behind the times

254
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,340
 as if we potentially outgrown them.

255
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,820
 You see, the beautiful thing about doubt

256
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,000
 is it's not a sign that Christianity is flawed.

257
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,680
 A doubt is a sign that our understanding

258
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,220
 of Christianity is flawed.

259
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,060
 If you're here and you're wrestling with doubt,

260
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,380
 it's not an issue with Christ,

261
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,460
 it's an issue in your understanding of who Christ is,

262
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,180
 which is actually really encouraging news

263
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,180
 because it means that God, He is just as unsearchable,

264
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,700
 He is just as unfathomable,

265
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,700
 He is just as uncontainable as He claims He is, right?

266
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,060
 If God was actually able to be pinned down by you,

267
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,780
 the Almighty, when you were in your teenage years,

268
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,580
 is that a God worth following?

269
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,920
 No, like no one here is rocking Nike Elites

270
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,180
 and Sperry's tonight, I wouldn't guess.

271
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,300
 And the reason why is you've likely outgrown them.

272
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,700
 But with that said,

273
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,060
 does that mean that you've outgrown the need for shoes?

274
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,300
 No, I'd guess that your shoe game

275
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,000
 is at its very best right now.

276
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,140
 The same has to happen when it comes to our faith.

277
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,460
 We have to be willing to look at our doubts

278
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,020
 and not allow them to lead us further from God,

279
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,220
 but allow them to lead us further into God.

280
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,700
 And so I'm really excited because some of you are here,

281
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,500
 you're wrestling and yet God's like,

282
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,220
 "Oh baby, we're about to go deep.

283
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,620
 "I'm about to take you to a new level of understanding.

284
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,280
 "I'm about to take you to a new place of faith.

285
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,700
 "I'm about to stir up something new in your spirit."

286
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,540
 Are you ready?

287
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,060
 That's what God wants to do.

288
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,360
 That's his heart and I love the enthusiasm.

289
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,740
 A.J. Swoboda in his book "After Doubt" said it like this.

290
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,800
 He said, "There's often no greater act of faith

291
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,800
 "in fidelity to God than bearing one's deepest held beliefs

292
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,380
 "to divine criticism so that God might be loved more."

293
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,540
 To put it simply, kicking the tires

294
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,620
 doesn't mean you hate the car.

295
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,620
 You see, doubt, it's not the enemy of your affections

296
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,560
 for God.

297
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,060
 Doubt is the opportunity to love God more,

298
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:13,340
 to find answers that not only satisfy your questions,

299
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,100
 but satisfy your souls.

300
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,080
 That's what I wanna talk to you about tonight.

301
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,700
 And in order for us to do it,

302
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,380
 we're gonna look at a passage in the gospel of Luke.

303
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,700
 So if you have a Bible, you can pull it out

304
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,540
 and turn with me to Luke chapter 24.

305
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,020
 As you do that, I wanna set up some context,

306
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,180
 not just to fill the gap as you flip the pages,

307
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,580
 but to really set something up

308
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,780
 that I think will be helpful to you

309
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,780
 because this idea of deconstruction

310
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,020
 is not an idea that is new to Jesus.

311
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,100
 It's something that he actually dealt with repeatedly

312
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,780
 over the course of his ministry.

313
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,580
 And he cared a great deal about

314
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,780
 because when we come to this passage in Luke chapter 24,

315
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,260
 what we need to know is Jesus is right on the heels

316
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,340
 of his resurrection, yet he has not yet gone to the father.

317
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,020
 He has not yet ascended back to heaven.

318
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,100
 And all throughout this 40 day window

319
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,040
 that he has between the resurrection and the ascension,

320
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,520
 Jesus keeps making special guest appearances

321
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,540
 all across the Holy land.

322
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,740
 He makes cameos in the most unlikely of places

323
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,220
 because if you were him and I were him,

324
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,740
 what would we likely do?

325
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,540
 We'd probably show up and rebuke the religious elite.

326
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,340
 Hey, you guys, what were you thinking?

327
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,740
 We would probably show up and we would confront the Romans.

328
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,660
 You crucified me, man.

329
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,780
 What were you thinking?

330
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,220
 Jesus doesn't do that.

331
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,540
 He doesn't go to the religious elite.

332
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,940
 He doesn't go to the Romans.

333
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,380
 Instead, what Jesus does is he pursues the doubtful.

334
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,740
 That's his mission in this 40 day window.

335
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,740
 It's to restore the faith of the faint hearted.

336
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,080
 He goes to Mary.

337
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,620
 He comes to Thomas.

338
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,980
 He restores Peter.

339
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,260
 He appears in the upper room.

340
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,560
 And right here, he walks with two disciples

341
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,220
 down a road to Emmaus.

342
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,900
 So it says this in Luke chapter 24.

343
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,700
 We'll pick it up in verse 13.

344
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,220
 That very day, two of them were going

345
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,440
 to a village named Emmaus,

346
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,860
 about seven miles from Jerusalem.

347
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,300
 And they were talking with each other

348
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,780
 about all these things that had happened.

349
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,740
 While they were talking and discussing together,

350
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,820
 Jesus himself drew near and he went with them.

351
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,180
 But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.

352
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,340
 And he said to them,

353
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,620
 what is this conversation that you're having

354
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,300
 or that you're holding with each other as you walk?

355
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,740
 And they stood still looking sad.

356
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,980
 Then one of them named Cleopas answered him,

357
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,660
 are you the only visitor to Jerusalem

358
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,700
 who does not know the things

359
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,540
 that have happened here in these days?

360
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,260
 And he said to them, what things?

361
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,740
 And they said to him, concerning Jesus of Nazareth,

362
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,020
 a man who was a prophet, mighty indeed,

363
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,780
 and word before God and all the people,

364
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,300
 and how our chief priests and rulers

365
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,140
 delivered him up to be condemned to death and crucified him.

366
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,500
 But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel.

367
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,020
 Yes, and besides all this,

368
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,060
 it's now the third day since these things have happened.

369
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,300
 That comment at the end, it's now the third day,

370
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,700
 it means that they're at a moment of incredible discouragement

371
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,380
 because it was the point at which the Jewish mind

372
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,760
 thought that the soul would leave the body upon death.

373
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,600
 Day three.

374
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,660
 So it's interesting.

375
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,700
 Whenever you read the resurrection appearances of Jesus

376
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,120
 at the end of the gospels,

377
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,620
 what you find is he not only repeatedly appears to people,

378
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,180
 but he constantly conceals his identity.

379
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,660
 He's got a flair for the dramatic.

380
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,500
 He likes a grand entrance.

381
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,100
 We find that three different times,

382
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,140
 he conceals his identity.

383
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,620
 He comes to Mary and he presents himself as a gardener.

384
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,300
 He comes to Peter and the seven disciples,

385
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,020
 and he looks like a man sitting on shore beside the fire.

386
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,020
 And then in this moment,

387
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,260
 he looks like a fellow wanderer

388
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,500
 to both Cleopas and his companion on the road to Emmaus,

389
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,820
 which begs the question, why?

390
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,700
 Why does Jesus conceal his identity in these moments?

391
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,740
 Well, scholars, they have a variety of different answers

392
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,980
 that no one knows for sure.

393
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,620
 Some scholars look at it and they say,

394
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,940
 this is going to be the method of Jesus's primary ministry

395
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,900
 once he ascends to heaven.

396
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,060
 It's going to be communicated through common men.

397
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,140
 And so he wants to be a common man

398
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,700
 that is communicating to other common men.

399
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,860
 That's why he conceals his identity.

400
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,060
 Other people look at it and say,

401
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,500
 it's because of the disbelief of those

402
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,380
 that he's appearing to.

403
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,420
 He's looking at them and they cannot see him for who he is

404
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,940
 because they don't believe completely.

405
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,820
 Others say that he is supernaturally concealing his identity.

406
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,720
 He's throwing up a spiritual mask

407
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,020
 to conceal himself from these others.

408
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,980
 Others look at him and say,

409
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,420
 it's just a physical obstruction.

410
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,320
 He's too far away.

411
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,140
 They can't make out the details of his face.

412
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,040
 We don't know why he conceals his identity ultimately.

413
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,460
 And yet, as I peeled through these pages

414
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,780
 and poured over and study,

415
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,220
 I think I arrived at a hunch that's pretty unique.

416
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,220
 I think that Jesus conceals his identity repeatedly

417
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,060
 in these moments because he wants to,

418
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,780
 he wants to engage with people

419
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,680
 at the level of their rawest emotion.

420
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,540
 Like that's what you see.

421
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,820
 Like Jesus conceals his identity and he comes to Mary

422
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,340
 and what he sees is that she's sorrowful.

423
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,880
 He conceals his identity and he comes to Peter

424
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,240
 and he sees that he's shameful.

425
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,480
 He conceals his identity and he comes to these two guys

426
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,680
 and he sees that they're disappointed.

427
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,140
 By way of him hiding who he is,

428
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,660
 we can actually see who they are.

429
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,480
 He wants to engage people at an emotional level.

430
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,320
 So much so that it says in this passage

431
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,720
 that they stood still looking sad

432
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,040
 because they had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel.

433
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,720
 And yet, because he did live up to that expectation,

434
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,600
 according to their estimation,

435
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,880
 they are walking away from him entirely.

436
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,560
 Their doubt has descended to such a place

437
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,920
 that they're bailing on this whole way of Christ altogether.

438
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,920
 And yet Jesus comes to them and he reveals to us

439
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,060
 the very first thing he does is he restores the doubtful.

440
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,400
 Jesus walks with those who are walking away.

441
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,560
 Jesus walks with those who are walking away.

442
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,880
 That's the first way he pursues those downcast in doubt.

443
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,800
 These guys are sad, they're disappointed.

444
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,640
 They're probably headed to Emmaus

445
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,760
 for a little bit of self-care.

446
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,800
 The city was known for being a place of natural hot springs.

447
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,120
 And so they think that's probably nice

448
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
 after everything that they've lived through.

449
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,740
 And yet what we know is because they're on the way to Emmaus,

450
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,880
 they are not huddled with the other disciples

451
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,960
 in the upper room.

452
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,320
 They're not gathered with the women by the tomb.

453
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
 They're not even hiding in Jerusalem

454
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,720
 or waiting for some new development in the story.

455
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,680
 No, they have given up.

456
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,520
 They are walking away.

457
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,140
 They have chosen to move on with their life.

458
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,540
 And while it would be easy for us on this side of the cross

459
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,040
 to look at them and shake our head and wag our finger,

460
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,200
 how dare you guys?

461
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,160
 We do this ourselves.

462
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,080
 We walk away from Jesus for all sorts of different reasons,

463
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,560
 even good reasons.

464
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,840
 Like some of us, we walk away from the faith

465
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,380
 because we've been hurt by the church.

466
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,160
 Others of us walk away because we've been slandered

467
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,520
 and belittled by other Christians.

468
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,840
 We walk away from the church because we look at the pulpit

469
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,200
 and think it's become a place of political theater

470
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,080
 over the course of the last two election cycles

471
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,900
 and eight years altogether.

472
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,640
 We walk away from the church because God claims to be good

473
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,040
 and yet he let me down.

474
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,920
 He didn't show up when I needed him most.

475
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,900
 We walk away from the church

476
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,880
 because there are other truth claims out there

477
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,280
 that seem to make better sense of my reality,

478
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,940
 that seem to help explain my experience.

479
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,280
 Like we all have our reasons for walking away,

480
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,200
 even good reasons for doing so.

481
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,160
 And yet Jesus is anything but reasonable.

482
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,680
 He's anything but reasonable.

483
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,360
 That's what Paul says in Romans chapter five.

484
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,400
 He says, "For while we were still weak,

485
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,380
 "at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.

486
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,260
 "For one will scarcely die for a righteous person,

487
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,240
 "though perhaps for a good person, one would dare to die."

488
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,220
 Do you see, do you hear Paul reasoning?

489
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,840
 But God shows his love for us

490
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,640
 in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

491
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,960
 He does the most unreasonable thing.

492
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,040
 Like he loves his enemies and he forgives his adversaries

493
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,680
 and he gives of himself without any expectation

494
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,960
 of anything in return.

495
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,680
 He dies a death he does not deserve.

496
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,160
 He rises from the grave.

497
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,400
 Who does that?

498
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,980
 He tells us, "Hey, seek after me,"

499
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,140
 when none of us are worthy of seeking after him.

500
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,580
 And ultimately he walks with us when we walk away from him.

501
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,740
 This is who our Jesus is.

502
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,520
 So let me ask you, if you're here tonight

503
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,360
 and you're doubting Jesus, then what are you walking towards?

504
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,740
 Like they're not just walking away from Jerusalem

505
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,340
 and all the doubt and all the disappointment

506
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,820
 that was there behind them.

507
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,140
 They are actually walking towards Emmaus.

508
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,600
 So it begs the question for us,

509
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,780
 where is it that we're walking?

510
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,860
 Where are you going?

511
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,820
 Are you walking towards romance?

512
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,020
 Are you walking towards success or comfort,

513
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,700
 power, approval, money?

514
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,500
 Like what is it that you're walking towards?

515
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,220
 And I don't ask you that because I want to shame you

516
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,620
 with respect to where you're walking.

517
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,860
 I ask you that because wherever it is you're walking,

518
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,120
 there it is that Jesus is going to find you.

519
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,560
 He meets them on this road and he will meet you

520
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,940
 on whatever road it is you're walking.

521
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,460
 Not because he wants you to get there,

522
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,020
 but because he wants to get you back to him.

523
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,940
 That's what he's gonna do.

524
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,580
 He walks with those who are walking away.

525
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,980
 But it's not just that.

526
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,860
 He's good company.

527
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,600
 He talks along the way as well,

528
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,180
 which is what we read if we keep going.

529
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,540
 It says in verse 22 through 27,

530
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,100
 "Moreover, some women of our company, they amazed us.

531
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,600
 "They were at the tomb early in the morning,

532
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,780
 "and when they did not find his body,

533
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,220
 "they came back saying that they had even seen

534
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,360
 "a vision of angels who said that he was alive.

535
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,520
 "Some of those who were with us went to the tomb,

536
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,840
 "and they found it just as the women had said,

537
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,120
 "but him they did not see.

538
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,140
 "He said to them," talking about Jesus,

539
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,780
 "O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe

540
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,600
 "all that the prophets have spoken.

541
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,140
 "Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer

542
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,360
 "these things and enter into his glory?

543
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,040
 "And beginning with Moses and all the prophets,

544
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,300
 "he interpreted to them in all the scriptures

545
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,980
 "the things concerning himself."

546
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,220
 When Jesus happens upon these two disciples,

547
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,820
 it says in verse 15 that he sees them

548
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,460
 talking and discussing, which to us,

549
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,220
 as we read it in English, just feels like

550
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,380
 they're a couple of chatty Cathy's.

551
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,900
 Like it just feels like these are synonymous verbs

552
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,900
 that describe the fact that they are really

553
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,380
 in some sort of intense dialogue,

554
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,500
 and yet when you go and you read it

555
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,300
 in the original language, you see that they are talking

556
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,020
 and they're debating.

557
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,180
 That's what they're doing.

558
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,580
 Why do we debate?

559
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,100
 Because we don't agree with one another.

560
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:02,100
 You see, conflict is always preceded by confusion,

561
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,940
 some misunderstanding, and yet it is into their conflict

562
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,100
 that Jesus enters, and the reason for it

563
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,780
 is because as he comes to us in our doubt,

564
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,020
 Jesus repeatedly seeks to calm our confusion with his word.

565
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,360
 Jesus calms our confusion with his word.

566
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,360
 I love that Jesus doesn't just jump straight

567
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,860
 to fixing their problems.

568
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,680
 Like he doesn't interject in their conversation,

569
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,560
 he doesn't correct their misunderstandings,

570
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,520
 he doesn't direct them, "Hey guys,

571
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,840
 "y'all better get back to Jerusalem."

572
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,300
 Instead, what he chooses to do is something

573
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,520
 that the church fails to do so very often.

574
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,000
 He creates conversational space for curiosity

575
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,660
 and perplexity and even uncertainty

576
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,340
 because Jesus knows that when it comes to spiritual matters,

577
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,880
 doubts and questions, they're an inevitable part

578
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,660
 of the process.

579
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,140
 So let me just speak to the believer in the room

580
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,000
 for a moment.

581
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,540
 If our churches look and talk and act and believe

582
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,460
 the same way, then we are not as welcoming

583
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,500
 to the watching world as we think we are.

584
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,820
 You see, we have to cultivate spaces

585
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,820
 that we find not only the right answers given,

586
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,760
 but we see the real questions asked.

587
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,420
 We're skeptics and critics and misfits and outcasts.

588
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,920
 They can come and they can honestly process,

589
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,200
 they can sincerely seek and they can hopefully find

590
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,580
 the same Jesus that found us.

591
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,420
 That's what we have to do.

592
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,780
 So I remember my freshman year,

593
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,600
 probably a similar experience to some of you

594
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,260
 if you were there at 18, 19 in your first year of college.

595
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,620
 Like it was the first year that I found

596
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:02,520
 my greatest singular season of spiritually seeking.

597
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
 For the first time in my life,

598
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,060
 nobody was forcing me to go to church.

599
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,140
 Nobody was looking at me and pressuring me

600
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,100
 to go to Bible study.

601
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,660
 Nobody was coercing me with pizza and video games

602
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,360
 to go to youth group on Wednesday night.

603
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,920
 Like I could choose to do what I wanted,

604
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,780
 when I wanted, how I wanted.

605
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,540
 Like it was totally up to me.

606
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,700
 And yet, despite the fact that I had unlimited freedom,

607
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,840
 I still had this massive curiosity about Christianity.

608
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,100
 Like there were some things for sure

609
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,940
 that I had questions about, I don't know, man.

610
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,780
 And yet there were other things within the faith

611
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,220
 that I had a real interest in.

612
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,620
 I found a fascination with.

613
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,260
 And so as I'm navigating the complex waters of Christianity

614
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,820
 because they are complex waters,

615
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,500
 I was so fortunate to have an older friend of mine

616
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:52,660
 spend hours with me at a coffee shop.

617
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,460
 Not driving the conversation,

618
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,220
 but just clarifying my questions.

619
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,960
 Just helping me along the way.

620
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,260
 That's what Jesus does with the disciples in this story.

621
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,100
 Like he welcomes them where they are.

622
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,160
 Like he doesn't narrow their discipleship

623
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,020
 to a strict set of doctrinal distinctives

624
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,980
 that double as a source of tribal identity and pride.

625
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:18,540
 He listens to them.

626
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,280
 He walks with them.

627
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,700
 And eventually he does speak to them.

628
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,700
 What does he say?

629
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,240
 Oh foolish ones.

630
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,940
 Which can sound really biting to our English ears.

631
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,320
 And yet, in the original language,

632
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,480
 it's actually just a statement that's more matter of fact.

633
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,000
 He's looking at them and after everything they've unpacked,

634
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,320
 he simply says something along the lines of,

635
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,480
 you guys, you know better.

636
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,200
 You know better than this.

637
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,280
 And he patiently proceeds to show them

638
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,880
 how all of the scripture from Moses

639
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,720
 to all the prophets are pointing to him.

640
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,040
 In 2 Corinthians, it says it like this.

641
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,060
 For to this day, when they read the old covenant,

642
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,640
 the same veil remains unlifted because only through Christ

643
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,080
 is that veil taken away.

644
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,980
 Yes, to this day, whenever Moses read,

645
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,820
 a veil lies over their hearts.

646
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,000
 But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.

647
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,160
 You see, they thought they understood.

648
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,320
 They thought they had it figured out.

649
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,720
 They thought they connected all the dots.

650
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,440
 They thought they had cracked the code.

651
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,200
 But they were wrong.

652
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,400
 Which is actually really good news.

653
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,600
 Doesn't sound like good news.

654
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,820
 None of us want to be wrong.

655
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,440
 And yet it's such good news for the doubtful,

656
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,720
 for the disappointed.

657
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,000
 Because what it does is it tells us there's hope.

658
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,380
 Disappointment's not the end of your story.

659
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,440
 Doubt's not the end of your story.

660
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,100
 There's a better explanation for your reality

661
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,580
 than the things that have spoken in already.

662
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,960
 But the way you find that hope,

663
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,640
 if you start listening to Jesus,

664
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,040
 then whatever it is caused your confusion

665
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,360
 in the first place.

666
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,620
 And I think that this is gonna happen

667
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,160
 for some people in this room tonight.

668
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,980
 Like I think maybe for the first time in a long time,

669
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,760
 some of us are gonna,

670
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,000
 we're gonna stop listening to what other people say

671
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,160
 about God from our podcasts or from our families

672
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,560
 or our friend groups or from platforms or from social media.

673
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,720
 And we're gonna start listening

674
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,120
 to what God has to say himself.

675
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,080
 Like rather than letting the culture weigh in

676
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,980
 on our spirituality,

677
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:34,040
 we're gonna let the scripture weigh in on our spirituality.

678
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,180
 We're gonna redignify the voice of God in our lives

679
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,760
 because it is his voice and his voice alone

680
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,720
 by way of his word that leads us to greater hope.

681
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,640
 And so I think it's gonna happen.

682
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,880
 Like I think some of you, you're gonna open his word.

683
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,240
 You're gonna listen to his voice.

684
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,160
 You're gonna watch the way he lives.

685
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,060
 You're gonna observe the way he engages with other people.

686
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,560
 You're gonna have the chance to see the miracles

687
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,320
 he performs and then you're going to seek his kingdom.

688
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,860
 And by the grace of God, you're gonna find your faith again.

689
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,860
 Because this is what Jesus does.

690
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:14,860
 He comes to calm confusion with his word.

691
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,260
 Where's the word at in your life?

692
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:23,000
 How fast do you hold to it?

693
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,060
 It's an anchor for the doubting soul.

694
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:33,780
 And it's a sure way to consistently provide a beacon of hope.

695
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:38,900
 Why do I think all that?

696
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,300
 Because that's how this story ends.

697
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,260
 We'll pick it up in 28.

698
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,100
 It says, so they drew near to the village

699
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,060
 to which they were going.

700
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,740
 And Jesus acted as if he was going farther,

701
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,420
 but they urged him strongly saying, stay with us.

702
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,940
 It's toward evening and the day is now far spent.

703
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,000
 So he went in to stay with them.

704
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,840
 And when he was at table with them, he took the bread

705
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,880
 and he blessed and he broke it and he gave it to them.

706
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,220
 And their eyes were opened and they recognized him.

707
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,600
 And he vanished from their sight.

708
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,560
 Don't you love it?

709
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,680
 They said to each other, did not our hearts burn within us

710
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,720
 while he talked to us on the road?

711
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,400
 While he opened to us the scriptures.

712
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,700
 Like I love the way the story ends.

713
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,960
 Like Jesus walks with them for seven miles.

714
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,980
 He talks with them through all their doubts.

715
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,820
 He unpacks with them the entirety of the scripture.

716
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:32,420
 And yet it isn't until he breaks bread with them at dinner

717
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:37,060
 that they realize this is no ordinary guy.

718
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,500
 This is Jesus.

719
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:44,140
 Like Jesus could have restored their faith theologically.

720
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,020
 He could have restored their faith apologetically.

721
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,780
 He could have restored their faith philosophically.

722
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,800
 He could have restored their faith historically.

723
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,800
 And yet Jesus chooses to restore their faith relationally.

724
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,900
 He sits at table with them.

725
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,240
 He breaks bread.

726
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,880
 He has a meal.

727
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,760
 Like he chooses to use relationship as the means

728
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,820
 through which he brings them back to himself.

729
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,060
 Because Jesus doesn't just want your allegiance.

730
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,380
 He wants your affection.

731
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,940
 He wants your affection.

732
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,860
 That's why Jesus, as our third point,

733
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:21,020
 rekindles the flame of a heart grown cold.

734
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,580
 Jesus rekindles the flame of a heart grown cold.

735
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,300
 Do you have a cold heart here tonight?

736
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,420
 Then listen, you're in good company.

737
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,740
 Not because of the people around you,

738
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,900
 but because of the God above you.

739
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,000
 He's a God that seeks to reignite the fainting flame

740
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,420
 of faith in the lives of his people.

741
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,300
 And he wants to do it through relationship.

742
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,820
 Like it isn't until he breaks the bread

743
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,340
 and he extends it to them with the nail pierced hands

744
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,080
 that he and only he has that they realize.

745
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,180
 Those are the hands that stretched wide

746
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,920
 on the cross for me back then.

747
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,300
 And they're the same hands which reach out

748
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,540
 in relationship to me right now.

749
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,100
 They realize that in Jesus,

750
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,220
 he wants more than a theological commitment.

751
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,820
 He wants more than their moral conformity.

752
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,420
 He wants more than their religious observance.

753
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,380
 He wants a real relationship with them.

754
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,820
 Like, do you want a real relationship with God?

755
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,820
 Like not a phony, fake relationship,

756
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,740
 but not the kind of relationship where it's like,

757
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,080
 I know some facts about the individual.

758
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,320
 I can fire off a bunch of information that I've learned.

759
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,740
 That's not the kind of relationship he wants.

760
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,180
 He doesn't want the kind of relationship

761
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,420
 that distantly knows each other from afar.

762
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,860
 He doesn't want the kind of relationship

763
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,380
 that even just enjoy spending some time together

764
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,220
 at different moments.

765
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,460
 No, Jesus is not in for that.

766
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,140
 He wants a real relationship.

767
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,500
 He wants a face-to-face, all the time together,

768
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,020
 personally knowing, intimately acquainted

769
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,420
 kind of relationship with you.

770
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,620
 He wants to be close to you.

771
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,340
 That's the kind of heart that Jesus has for his people.

772
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,300
 Yeah, we often don't have the same sort of heart in return.

773
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:06,420
 He takes them back to the place where relationship began,

774
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,140
 where he breaks bread as a symbol of his broken body.

775
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,700
 He says, I would give everything to have you.

776
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,180
 I'd do anything to get you.

777
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:20,060
 I will give all of myself to get all of you

778
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:24,460
 because I don't just want your soul, I want your heart.

779
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,480
 I want your heart.

780
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,540
 Maybe you hear that and you think,

781
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,580
 yeah, man, that sounds nice.

782
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:35,020
 I bet that that is Jesus's perspective.

783
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:40,020
 I bet he does want relationship with these people,

784
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,180
 but I don't look anything like them.

785
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:46,580
 I don't act anything like them.

786
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:50,020
 I don't come from the same places as any of them.

787
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,940
 I don't believe any of the same things as them.

788
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,660
 Like, yes, Jesus wants a relationship with them,

789
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,820
 but I look nothing like them.

790
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,500
 And so therefore, Jesus wants nothing to do with me.

791
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,620
 If that's you and you hear all of this

792
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,820
 and you know all your doubt

793
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,440
 and you feel like you don't fit into the story,

794
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,920
 then you need to know.

795
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,260
 While we know the name of one disciple, Cleopas,

796
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:22,640
 we do not know the name nor identity of the other.

797
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,660
 That disciple, he or she, is known as the unknown disciple.

798
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,460
 And the reason it is is because Luke wants those

799
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,980
 that feel like this could never be their story

800
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,340
 to find themselves in the story.

801
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:44,500
 He wants you to know there's no one that Jesus doesn't want.

802
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:50,020
 There's no person that Jesus doesn't desire.

803
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,500
 Doesn't matter the depth or the degree of your doubt,

804
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,780
 this story is telling us that Jesus

805
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,420
 doesn't just want to build in us an unbreakable belief.

806
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,300
 He wants to build in us an unbreakable bond,

807
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,780
 one that can never be broken.

808
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:15,580
 So several years ago, I learned this lesson very personally

809
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,540
 when I endured what felt like the greatest

810
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,420
 personal challenge of my life to that point.

811
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,540
 It was one of those dark nights of the soul sort of moments.

812
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,180
 Some of you get what I'm talking about.

813
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,220
 I was standing at the precipice of a new job opportunity

814
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,180
 that was the stuff of my dreams.

815
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,340
 Like it was the very thing that I had secretly wished for,

816
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,900
 journaled about, prayed to God,

817
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:42,140
 yet never admitted allowed to because it was so ridiculous.

818
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,540
 It was so audacious.

819
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,540
 And yet like I found myself in the throes of a new,

820
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:51,820
 in the throes of actually attaining it.

821
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,860
 And so I found in that season,

822
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,460
 like I was closer to God than ever

823
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,580
 because I needed God more than ever.

824
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,420
 Like I was religiously, regularly going

825
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,900
 on prayer walks with God.

826
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,420
 Get out of the house and I would go

827
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,420
 for long stretches of my day.

828
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,480
 And I would just, I would talk to him.

829
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,320
 I would ask his help.

830
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,820
 I would seek his favor.

831
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,940
 I would declare my trust and I would pray for his will.

832
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,900
 Again and again and again,

833
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:27,300
 I prayer walked the walls of Jericho down on that thing.

834
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,900
 Which is why it was so shocking to me

835
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,460
 when in the 11th hour,

836
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,980
 the subject of my dreams

837
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,540
 was like a rug pulled out from underneath me.

838
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,260
 What I thought I was to attain

839
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,140
 was ripped away from me.

840
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:57,260
 And all I felt like I had were no more dreams,

841
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,540
 yet only doubts.

842
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:03,500
 Everything I'd longed for,

843
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,320
 everything I prayed for,

844
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,100
 everything I aimed for,

845
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,260
 all that I had been trying to set myself up to acquire,

846
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,380
 it was taken away from me in a moment.

847
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:17,060
 And all I felt in that instance

848
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:23,460
 was frustration and doubt and a faintness of heart

849
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,100
 that led me to a place in my spirituality

850
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,940
 I never thought I would find myself.

851
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,740
 It was late one evening, about a month or so later,

852
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,520
 that I was so depressed,

853
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,860
 I'm sitting in the center of my driveway

854
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,160
 at probably midnight.

855
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:47,540
 And I have nothing left to say to God.

856
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,180
 I've grumbled against Him,

857
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,620
 I've warred with Him,

858
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,900
 I've raged against the heavens,

859
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,640
 I've expressed all my disappointment.

860
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,140
 Some of you get what that feels like.

861
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:07,080
 And yet as I sat in the center of my driveway,

862
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:14,820
 I heard that still small voice

863
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,220
 that is so unmistakably God

864
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,300
 ask me this question,

865
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,380
 are we still gonna go for walks?

866
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:32,240
 All of my belief was broken,

867
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,140
 but my bond was not.

868
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:41,540
 No one can take away those

869
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,940
 that are in relationship to God.

870
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,380
 And no amount of doubt,

871
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,620
 no amount of disappointment,

872
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,660
 no amount of despair can wring you from His grip.

873
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,100
 It is far too strong to ever let you go.

874
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,940
 And you may feel,

875
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,140
 I'm so far away though,

876
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,820
 His arm is so very long.

877
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:06,420
 He wants a real relationship with you.

878
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,500
 Because He not only wants your soul,

879
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,700
 He wants your heart.

880
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,620
 For which God wants your heart.

881
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,260
 And what we learn by the end of this text

882
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,660
 is He wants it hot.

883
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:25,140
 And He will pursue you in the coldness of doubt

884
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,740
 until the flame of faith is rekindled again.

885
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,100
 Is your heart burning tonight within you?

886
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,420
 As you hear these words,

887
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:38,300
 as this truth washes over your faint spirit,

888
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,380
 is it burning again?

889
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,220
 John Wesley, he famously said at his conversion

890
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,580
 that his heart was gently warmed,

891
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,460
 strangely warmed.

892
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:54,620
 Friend, if your heart is warming here,

893
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:59,060
 it's because Jesus is wanting here.

894
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,020
 He is wanting for you.

895
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,540
 And we have such confidence that that's the case

896
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,260
 because what we know is when our hearts

897
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,940
 have grown darker than doubt in the dead of our sins,

898
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,020
 Jesus passionately pursued us anyways.

899
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,260
 Like He walked towards us

900
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,220
 and we had all walked away.

901
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,380
 Like all of us, we had abandoned God.

902
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,020
 Like sheep, we had gone astray.

903
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,500
 And yet Jesus said, "You'll never outrun me.

904
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,540
 "Doesn't matter how far away you walk from me,

905
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,700
 "I'll chase you down.

906
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,780
 "I'll race forward.

907
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,580
 "I will pursue you still because you're my people.

908
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,020
 "You may not want me, but I want you.

909
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,620
 "I'm gonna bring you back.

910
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,340
 "I'm gonna put you in my family

911
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,660
 "because I'm a God, I'm a Savior.

912
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,060
 "I'm a Lord that walks with those that walk away from me."

913
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,100
 Jesus, He calmed our confusion with His words.

914
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,620
 Like into the misery, in the madness of our sin,

915
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,380
 He spoke the words of life.

916
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,780
 Like He didn't just come to teach you some nice things,

917
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,020
 to increase your academia,

918
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,540
 to help you learn some new platitudes.

919
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,220
 No, He came to speak into you life.

920
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:08,260
 And He rekindled the flames of hearts grown cold.

921
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,220
 How cold is a dead heart?

922
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,580
 It's the coldest of all.

923
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:19,220
 And yet Jesus said, "I will take their cold heart

924
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,540
 "into my chest by dying their death

925
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,580
 "that they might have my living heart

926
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,820
 "and they might go free instead."

927
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:37,460
 It does not matter the degree of your doubt.

928
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,460
 What matters is the extent of His love.

929
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,260
 He wants relationship.

930
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,380
 Do you want it in return?

931
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,460
 Let me pray for you.

932
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:57,060
 God, I pray my friends here know

933
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:04,180
 that you really want them.

934
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,180
 It's impossible, God, for you to need us,

935
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,900
 for you are all sufficient.

936
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:16,020
 Therefore, God, for you to do what you've done

937
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,500
 in the person of your Son

938
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:23,700
 is a staggering declaration that you want all of us.

939
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,140
 Not because of anything we've done,

940
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,660
 not because of anything we've earned,

941
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,260
 not because of anything we deserve, God,

942
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,620
 but simply because you choose us.

943
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,180
 I pray, God, that for those in this room

944
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,100
 that feel like they are on the precipice of deconstruction,

945
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:45,020
 that think doubt is all that dwells ahead

946
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:48,420
 in their future, God, they might know it's not my doubt

947
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,980
 that awaits for me in the future,

948
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,340
 it's my Jesus that awaits for me instead.

949
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,940
 We love you, God, and we sing to you now

950
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:05,620
 the worship that is only worthy of you.

951
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:10,740
 It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

952
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,380
 Hey, porch, you can stand to your feet.

953
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,300
 We're gonna jump back into worship.

954
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,340
 And for a God like that,

955
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:20,780
 we're gonna blow the ever-loving roof off of this place.

956
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,020
 (congregation cheering)

957
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,740
 Like it is week two, it is the beginning of a year,

958
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:32,740
 and yet we are going to go hard here in the final stretch.

959
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:35,220
 We believe that God's worth it, amen?

960
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,060
 - Amen.

961
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,540
 - So we're gonna sing like we believe it.

962
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,420
 Sometimes what you have to do to a doubting heart

963
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,140
 is you have to declare to it the hope it's forgotten.

964
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,260
 That's what we're gonna do as we sing together here.

965
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,540
 Some of you, you need to process with somebody.

966
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,100
 We've got a team down here to my left and to my right

967
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,660
 that would love to engage with you,

968
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,420
 but listen, the band has led, I have led,

969
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,220
 Now you get to lead the moments yours lets me with them together.

970
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,580
