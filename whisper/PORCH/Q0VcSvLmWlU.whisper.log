[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:45.800]   Well, tonight we're continuing a series called Skeptical.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.920]   If you're just joining us, we took a two week break.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.280]   Ben Stewart, who was awesome, came and hung out.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.160]   Yeah, whoops.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.120]   And we're continuing that series tonight.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.800]   I'm gonna give us a little traction by telling kind of a story that'll give
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.520]   indication where we're going.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.280]   About a month ago, one of my neighbors asked if I would do him a favor when he
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.320]   was gone on vacation for eight days.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.120]   And so I said, yeah, sure, what is it?
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.880]   And he said, will you watch my chickens?
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.040]   And chickens sit.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.840]   And so I don't really know what that entails.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.040]   Like, I grew up in a city, I didn't grow up on a farm, I've never been around a
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.600]   chicken before.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.680]   And so do you chicken walk?
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.760]   What do you do with a chicken?
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.840]   And he said, no, no, no.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.000]   All you gotta do is go over and let them out of the coop in the morning and feed
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.480]   them.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.840]   And then in the evening, put them back in the coop and feed them again and pick up
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.560]   the eggs.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.480]   And so this is easy, this is great.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.160]   And so he leaves and I'm over chicken sitting and taking care of these chickens.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.560]   And a couple of days in, I decide, hey, I'm going to bring my dog over one night
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.360]   because the chickens are protected.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.560]   They're in this coop, fenced off area.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.160]   This is great.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.400]   My dog's like enormous.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.440]   He's like 115 pounds and it was a terrible investment.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.680]   He's the investment that keeps on needing investment because he like eats remotes.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.960]   But anyway, so we need to get energy out of him.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.680]   And so we brought him over there, I brought him over there, and I'm in the
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.760]   coop and I'm feeding the chickens and I'm setting the feet out.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.440]   And all of a sudden I hear a sound unlike anything I'd ever heard before.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.360]   And it was, "Ahh!
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.480]   Pika!
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.240]   And I'm in the coop.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.240]   And so I leave the coop and I run outside.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.560]   And behind the coop, my dog is sitting there with a chicken in his mouth.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.800]   One of them had like escaped and so he's moving the chicken around and he's got
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.640]   her by the leg.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.960]   And so I go in panic mode.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.680]   I throw the dog off of the chicken.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.920]   I tie him up and I go over and see this chicken who there's no visible blood but
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.800]   she's like hobbling off on one leg.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.160]   And I'm going, "Oh my gosh, I ruined the chicken."
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.400]   And it hits me like because I don't know chickens.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.320]   I don't know the emotional attachment you have to a chicken if you're the owner.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.800]   Like is this a family pet?
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.720]   Does it have a name?
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.560]   Did I just ruin something?
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.400]   Should I call him?
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.520]   But what if it is like the pet and it ruins the vacation?
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.200]   What do I do here?
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.800]   So I'm thinking, "I'm sure this will be fine.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.680]   Let's figure out what happened."
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.800]   So I take her leg and I see no wounds and I'm like feeling around for broken bones
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.440]   as though I would know what those feel like.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.000]   And then I recognize there's a little cut on her foot.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.320]   And so my wife brings over hydrogen peroxide and we're like trying to nurse
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.560]   this little chicken because we don't know.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.600]   Like is this a big deal?
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.120]   Not a big deal.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.520]   And so it doesn't get any better and we just decide, "We'll just let her sleep
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.200]   this one off."
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.160]   And so we're going to give her her own little area.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.800]   She'll sleep.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.680]   I'm sure she'll be great in the morning.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.240]   We go back the next day and don't bring the dog ever again.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.240]   And the chicken hasn't moved and so it's just, "Well, I'm sure she's going to just
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.480]   sleep it off some more."
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.840]   And so we put her in our own little area, we give her some food and give her some
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.440]   water and we go back.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.000]   And then the next day, and she still hasn't moved.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.960]   And so we're like confused on what's going on.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.920]   We're worried about this chicken, still haven't contacted the owner because not
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.160]   really sure what to do.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.000]   And we go back that evening or I go back that evening.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.120]   And at some point between the hours of 8 a.m. and 9 p.m., the chicken went to be
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.600]   with the Lord and it was no longer with us.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.160]   And then again, we're going, it hits me, "What do I do with the body?
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.640]   Like, do I keep it for him to see?
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.040]   Do I throw it away?
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.720]   Do I bury it?
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.040]   Do I fry it and have it?
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.640]   Do I...
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.800]   We're like, "What do you do with this?"
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.360]   And then, "What am I...
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.040]   Should I call him?
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.800]   Should I try to find a replacement chicken?"
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.440]   I'm like Googling online, "White chickens, they're out there."
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.040]   And so this seems like a pretty easy deal.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.280]   And it was very evident that what had been left behind in peace, in the normal life
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.880]   the chickens had experienced, had been totally destroyed and totally changed
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.480]   after the owner had left.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.960]   What had been left behind and was originally there had been changed,
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.920]   altered, and destroyed.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.280]   And the reason I tell you that, and this feels like a jerky chicken story to go
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:02.680]   into a Bible story, is that the most common attack, or one of the more common
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.680]   attacks about the Bible, is that the Bible in its original form or the way that we
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.960]   have it right now, however it was originally left, has been changed,
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.280]   or it has been destroyed, or it has been corrupted.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.400]   That the Bible is not trustworthy as it relates to how accurate it was from when
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.440]   it was originally given, whether mistakes were made, or whether errors occurred,
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.600]   or whether myths developed, how early did these people even live?
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.680]   Do what we have, is it accurate?
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.560]   And so for the next really 40 minutes or 30 minutes, we're going to dive into this
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.200]   subject of, can we trust the Bible?
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.840]   Is what we have what they have?
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.680]   Can we trust what's between the pages of the Bible?
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.360]   And so we're going to explore three little topics.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.040]   We're going to explore the mistakes that were made, or the supposed changes that
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.920]   exist inside of the Bible.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.080]   We're going to explore myth.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.960]   Could it have been myth?
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.600]   Could it have been added in stories, in legends that kind of grew about Jesus
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.560]   afterwards?
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.280]   And then I'm going to give you really where I go and why I believe personally
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.120]   the Bible is trustworthy.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.800]   So first up is the mistakes.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.160]   Were there mistakes that were made?
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.560]   And you may be going, "Mistakes?
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.680]   How can this...this is perfect.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.080]   How can there be a mistake made?"
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.680]   The way the Bible was written, specifically the New Testament,
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.560]   we're going to focus on that.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.360]   We'll come back to the Old Testament at the end.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.800]   Was the scribes were the names of the people who would take a copy of a book of
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.600]   Matthew, or Mark, or Luke, or John, and they would copy it out.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.880]   There wasn't a Kinko's, there wasn't a copy machine.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.840]   They would just write out, which I know is a big surprise, like, "What?
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.480]   Kinko's?"
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.720]   So the scribes would write out and they'd make different copies.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.400]   And in that process, errors or differences occurred.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.280]   And this may be news.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.400]   You may have never heard about this.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.640]   And so in the copying process of the thousands of manuscripts that we have
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.520]   from the ancient world, or from the first few centuries of the New Testament,
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.400]   errors occurred.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.640]   And you may have heard this, you maybe have some professor who has said the
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.960]   Bible's had so many errors, who knows?
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.720]   We can't trust it.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.120]   It's been translated so many different times.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.160]   It's full of errors.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.320]   Can we trust it?
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:17.280]   And the bad news is there are errors or differences in the original manuscripts.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.040]   That when the scribes wrote, there were differences in each of their
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.280]   manuscripts, or in many of them.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.920]   And so that's the bad news.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:30.920]   The good news is that the differences that exist, 99% of them fall into three
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.720]   categories.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.000]   The first one is spelling errors, that they were spelling differences.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.960]   And so it's not like enormous things.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.320]   It's like John, the name John is wanus in Greek.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.880]   And sometimes it was spelled with two Ns, and sometimes it was spelled with one N.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.640]   And so every time that it was spelled with one N or two Ns, there's a difference.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.880]   And so that's a difference, that's an error.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.560]   The second category, this is in the 99%, the second part of that 99% was word
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.000]   order.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.200]   One of the common, I don't know, this is like fascinating stuff.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.720]   It's like, there were changes.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.640]   Oh, that's not really a change, that's a boring change.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.520]   There were word order changes.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.920]   One of the most common changes or errors you may hear people reference to, and this
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.320]   is what they're referring to, is word order.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.640]   Because in Greek, word order works differently than it does in English.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.240]   One of the most common ones is Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.160]   That some manuscripts read out, and as they're writing about it, they say Christ
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.560]   Jesus, and then someone said Jesus Christ.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.280]   And so every time there's a difference, there's a variant, or what some people
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.320]   refer to as an error.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.040]   The third category is the use of the article "the."
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:36.680]   And so in that 99%, you're going to hear people, maybe if you do some research,
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.240]   you'll hear people say there's thousands of errors, and 99% of those errors fall
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.720]   into these three, spelling errors, word order, or the use of the article "the."
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.160]   "The" is an article, and in Greek, you can use it any and all the time.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.120]   When you read Greek, they have "the Jesus loved the John, they went to the pool,
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.200]   and the end."
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.480]   They have it everywhere that they go.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.080]   "The," it's like continually used.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.440]   So if someone said, "Jesus loved the John," or "the John loved Jesus," and they left
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.040]   out one, that's an error.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.360]   So those make up 99% of the errors and the mistakes that exist.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.720]   What about that 1%?
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:18.400]   In grad school, we had to study the 1% of the changes that actually have meaning.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.840]   And you would think it would be so exciting, but I'm going to actually give you one of
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.640]   the more significant ones, and you can see how it's not as threatening or as
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.520]   exciting, even as you may even hope it would be.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.320]   Here's one of the more common ones.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.960]   1 Thessalonians 2, 7 says this.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:38.760]   So we have some manuscripts that say this, "But we were gentle among you, like a
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.320]   nursing mother taking care of her own children."
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:48.720]   And then we found an earlier manuscript that said, "But we were infants among you,
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.400]   like a nursing mother taking care of her own children."
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.560]   The reason is the word for infant and gentle has one letter difference,
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.880]   napioi and apioi.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.680]   And I promise this is going somewhere because it sounds like this is so boring.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.800]   This is the substance of the New Testament errors or differences.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.920]   All of them are as trivial as this.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.360]   I remember sitting in class, studying and going, "Hey, where's like the big one?
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.880]   Where's the one that says Jesus died on a cross, and this one says he died in a
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.000]   camel accident?
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.280]   Where's the one that says he had 12 disciples, and this one says he had one
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.160]   named Pedro?
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.680]   Where are like those ones at?
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.440]   I don't want to know about infant or gentle.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.320]   This is so boring.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.360]   Where's like the...give us the big ones."
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.840]   And they don't exist.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.640]   What you're seeing is one of the more trivial ones or one of the more hard ones
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.560]   that we have out there.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.480]   And so what you and I can be confident in is that the New Testament that you and I
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:49.960]   have is accurate beyond 99% in the changes that are there.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.360]   Everyone agrees on this next sentence.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.760]   None of them affect one Christian belief or doctrine.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.840]   None of them.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.920]   That what you and I can rest assured in is that the mistakes or the differences that
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.120]   exist don't threaten anything we believe.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.000]   They're all as trivial as that.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.840]   And because we have so many manuscripts, we're able to even see when that error
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.720]   happened.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.560]   And so the reason this is important is because as you engage with people in the
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.400]   workplace, or maybe you have a family member or someone who goes, "Yeah, but the
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.600]   Bible's been translated so many times.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.240]   I mean, we can't really know if it's true.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.240]   It's been, you know, there's all these interpretations.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:25.960]   We can't really know.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.160]   It's been like the game telephone.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.480]   It's been translated over and over and over again."
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.720]   You can respond.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.360]   When your family friend or your crazy cousin comes up and has this idea,
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:44.680]   you can go, "Crazy cousin, do you know that the differences...I don't really like to use
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.640]   the word error, but the differences that do exist really don't make any difference
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.760]   at all.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.360]   They don't change anything we believe.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.560]   Yeah, there are some differences.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.960]   Maybe scribes spelled John with two Ns and one of them spelled it with one.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.440]   And that's fine.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:03.600]   But do you know, crazy cousin, that the differences don't make a difference at all?
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:09.200]   So you and I can read confidently knowing that what you have is what they had.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.040]   So what about the idea of myth?
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.880]   Couldn't these stories have been myth?
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.840]   I mean, you read ancient history and Caesar did all kinds of crazy things,
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.400]   like was half God and slayed a dragon.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.960]   And we read it and we know that they're myth.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:28.400]   Couldn't the idea of Jesus and his deity been a myth that really came along after he
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.600]   was alive?
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.160]   Couldn't that have been what developed...I mean, just like George Washington chopping
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.560]   down a cherry tree.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.720]   I mean, this is like the Da Vinci Code, if you saw the Da Vinci Code,
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.960]   which is a fascinating book and movie, just not accurate, and it's fiction.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.960]   And in the Da Vinci Code, they lay out that the story of Jesus was radically changed and
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.440]   a myth began to develop.
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.120]   So couldn't it be or could it be a myth?
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.400]   No.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.240]   Here's what we know about myth.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.200]   And this is really historical stuff, so I'm going to do the best I can to make it
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.160]   clear.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:07.640]   Myth, historians tell us, in fact, the leading historian on mythology from Oxford
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:14.520]   says that myth takes around 80 to 90 years at the shortest to develop.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.960]   When it comes to the question of how long does a myth take, myth being something that's
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.560]   true to be kind of combined with something that's not really true, it had a little bit
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.400]   of truth and the story just kind of grew.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:30.360]   He says it takes around at least 80 to 90 years because all of the eyewitnesses have
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.560]   to be dead.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:37.960]   In other words, a story can't grow until everyone who was actually there dies off.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:44.240]   The reason that is significant is because scholarship tells us that the story of Jesus
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:53.080]   and the writings of the New Testament all took place within 15 to 30 years after Jesus
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.080]   died.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.120]   And you may be going, "Wait, how do we know that?"
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:00.280]   Here's one of the more significant ways that we know that.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:05.240]   During 70 AD, there was an event that you have probably never heard about that took
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.560]   place in the city of Jerusalem.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.920]   It's sitting in your Bible.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.360]   You probably didn't study this in history, but in the modern era, this was the most significant
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.240]   date arguably for all Jews everywhere.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.760]   Here's what happened.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.400]   It was called the Jewish Wars.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:27.280]   And this was a four-year war between the Jews in Jerusalem and Rome.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:32.280]   Around 66, these kind of skirmishes and rebels who were Jewish said, "We don't want to be
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.400]   owned by Rome anymore.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.400]   We're not going to have it.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.760]   We're not paying taxes."
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.000]   And they began to gather supplies and they went into the city of Jerusalem.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.540]   And they walled off the city of Jerusalem.
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.000]   And they basically said, "Hey, we're not going to be your slaves."
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.880]   Rome sent messengers over to the city and said, "Hey, we're going to take you all out
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.200]   if you don't open the gates."
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.920]   And they basically said, "Come and take it," Alamo style.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.840]   And so Rome is now angry because you don't mess with Rome.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:04.120]   And so Rome sends legions of soldiers over there.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:09.320]   And for the next four years, there are skirmishes that take place outside of the city walls,
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.200]   but they were never able to break through the wall.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:20.280]   In August of 70 AD, Rome broke into the city and they'd been sitting out for four years
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.160]   in the heat of Palestine.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.720]   And they were angry.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.880]   They were not happy.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.560]   And so they go into the city.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.800]   They slaughtered close to a million people.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.280]   Josephus, who's a Jewish historian who was there at the time, references that they slaughtered
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:41.280]   one million people, were also told that they crucified men and women outside the city until
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.120]   Judea ran out of wood.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.760]   And then they started reusing it.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:52.360]   And not only that, they destroyed the temple.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.360]   The temple.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.440]   Everywhere that Jesus walked around and taught in the whole city in the context of the center
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.440]   of Jewish life.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.440]   I mean, this was a huge deal.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.680]   Sacrifice was at the heart of the Jewish culture.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.520]   And they destroyed, they set it on fire.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:09.280]   They carried away all the loot back to Rome, declaring their victory.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.640]   And ancient Judaism ceased and has ever since.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:19.000]   Now this was about 35 years after Jesus was on the earth.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.360]   And here's why that's significant.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.520]   Here's why I tell you all that like bloody story.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:31.080]   Because the New Testament, where many of these figures lived in Jerusalem or were around
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:36.600]   Jerusalem and Jesus was inside of that area, and Paul and James and all these guys who
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.960]   wrote most of the New Testament and the book of Acts, where it's always referencing Jerusalem,
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.640]   people going in and out.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.280]   They don't mention any of it.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.280]   This was a big deal.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.560]   I mean, this was a huge deal.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.920]   This was the day that everything changed for Israel.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:50.920]   Everything.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.920]   The context from which all of these men who were all Jewish little boys would have grown
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.480]   up was totally destroyed.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:07.880]   And the only logical explanation, history and scholars say is it hadn't happened.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.880]   It hadn't happened.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.480]   That the writings of the New Testament had to have taken place before that or else they
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.480]   would have mentioned it.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.480]   How could you not?
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.840]   It was so huge inside of their history.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.800]   I mean, in Acts, Paul's going to Jerusalem and coming back.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.960]   There's councils that meet in there.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.120]   How could you not mention this?
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.960]   It was so huge.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:31.360]   And the only logical explanation would be it hadn't happened.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:35.800]   In addition to that, if you were a perpetrator who is making up, you're not really John,
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.880]   but years later you're writing the book of John.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.800]   How could you not mention this?
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:45.120]   How could you not leverage this to prove that Jesus was the guy and not say, hey, just as
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.520]   Jesus said, I'm the only sacrifice God accepts.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.680]   He allowed the Romans to destroy the city.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.440]   Just as Jesus said, the temple would be torn down.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:01.080]   It was fulfilled, but it doesn't say any of that.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:06.360]   And scholars look and they say the only logical explanation is it hadn't happened.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:15.580]   All the writers had to have written before 65 or 66 AD.
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:19.960]   And the reason that's important is because that shoves the new Testament writings and
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.480]   do 20 to 30 years.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.880]   Some of the writings of Paul are dated 15 to 30 years.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:33.640]   And scholars remember, tell us it takes 80 to 90 years for a myth to develop.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.440]   80 to 90.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:44.000]   And the reason why that is significant is because the idea that the myth could have
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.800]   developed in that short time period would be almost like this.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.960]   20 years ago, last month, something significant happened that led to a trial.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.600]   Anyone know what it is?
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.600]   OJ Simpson.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.120]   OJ Simpson trial 20 years ago.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.120]   So that's 20 years.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.080]   So just like the gap, hey, the writers in that 20 years, maybe the legend could have
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   grown.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.840]   No, because the eyewitnesses were around.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.840]   Here's an example.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.920]   OJ Simpson, regardless of whether you think he was innocent and the white glove and guilty
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:16.520]   and not, no one thinks Nicole came back alive or no one thinks, yeah, but OJ was really
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.100]   a superhero.
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.160]   No one thinks any of these myths, no one would believe them because everyone would go, no,
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.160]   that's crazy.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.280]   She didn't come back alive.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:30.840]   Or no one would say she never really existed because it's too short of a timeframe.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.840]   In this room we'd go, no, I saw the white Broncos on TV.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.220]   We would know that it happened.
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.920]   And so the idea that the myth and legend could have grown in 20 years wouldn't make any sense
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:48.000]   because eyewitnesses were everywhere.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.920]   The evidence for the idea of miss and really just for the writings of the new Testament
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.040]   is so significant that you have to do something because here's what that does.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.920]   It shoves the writings back into the hands of the people who wrote them and into the
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.640]   short period of time after Jesus left the earth.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:17.240]   And in college, I was a history major at Texas A&M, which, yeah, is a terrible major if you
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:23.480]   have children someday, because you spend four years and you develop no tangible trade where
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.080]   you can like offer the world anything.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.640]   You just read a bunch of books and then you forget all of it.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.960]   And so they kick you out and you're like, you got to go.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.280]   And you're like, I don't have anything to go with.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.440]   And so, uh, but there was one valuable lesson that I learned sitting in class one day with
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.560]   history and here's what it was.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:44.600]   When it comes to history, you can't prove anything.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.600]   You may have never even heard this.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.880]   When it comes to history, you can't prove something happened.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:55.880]   You can only look at the evidence and conclude what is the most reasonable explanation.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.040]   You can only look at what happened.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.040]   The same thing in court.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.800]   A court is judging something that happened in the past and they have to not prove anything,
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.720]   but look at what is the most reasonable explanation.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:10.200]   And when it comes to the idea of Jesus and his movement and his followers and him dying
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:15.480]   and rising on a cross, the men who wrote these works, and it is proved that they were written
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:20.920]   within 15 to 30 years, the idea that it would be myth scholars would laugh at.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.500]   And so then you got to go, well, maybe they were lying.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:30.680]   Maybe they were lying as they went to their deaths for what they said they saw, not believed
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:36.560]   in like we talked a couple of weeks ago, what they said they saw.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:43.560]   And that's a bigger leap of faith than to say, maybe it actually happened.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.840]   And the idea of like myth and mistake, those are, are really two of the more common ones
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.640]   that people will bring up as it relates to the subject of the Bible.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:57.400]   And can we trust it down front and really just as you engage out in the city, but those
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.120]   are never really the real reason.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.760]   Cause the evidence, if you can look at it objectively presents such a strong case that
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.160]   you've got to do something with this man who showed up and changed the world, but it's
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.400]   never that.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.560]   That's always a smoke screen.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:13.920]   In other words, if you could prove, Hey, the mistakes, but you know, those mistakes weren't
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.920]   significant.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.700]   They didn't make any difference at all.
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:20.960]   People generally aren't like, Oh my gosh, I want to pray to receive Christ right here,
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.760]   right now.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.040]   It's a smoke screen.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.280]   The problem is not that the Bible contradicts itself.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:35.160]   It's that it contradicts them or it contradicts you and you can throw up smoke screens all
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:44.600]   day long, but the idea and the evidence behind the reliability of the new Testament is shocking.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:50.760]   And every other ancient literature in history, historical ancient literature pales in comparison
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.760]   to it.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.440]   And so that's not the real reason.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.320]   The real reason is you don't like what it says about homosexuality or the real reason
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.320]   is you don't like what it says about hell or you being a sinner or you having sex with
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.400]   your girlfriend or your girlfriend wanting to stop having sex because she thinks it's
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.680]   true and you're going, yeah, but what about the mistakes?
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.240]   How do we know like sex wasn't added later?
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.840]   It's true.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:20.320]   It's always a smoke screen.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:28.960]   I think that when I doubt, none of those are the reasons that when I doubt about the Bible
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.800]   being trustworthy and can it be trusted, it's not mistakes and it's not myths.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.800]   And honestly, when you get into like high level scholarship, all scholars would say,
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.960]   no, those are not legitimate on any side.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.800]   Liberal and conservative would say, no, the myths thing can't be true.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:48.200]   And the mistakes thing, that's what people say who just want to sleep with their girlfriend.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.840]   Nobody says that, who actually has done the research.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:24:00.720]   But when I doubt and I do as it relates to, are we crazy?
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:05.360]   I mean, when I read parts, honestly, of the Old Testament, some of the new, but just Adam
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:11.320]   and Eve running around naked in the garden and Jonah and the belly of a fish and people
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.960]   living to be a thousand, how did that happen?
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.960]   What do you even look like when you're a thousand?
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.360]   What do you look like past 200?
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.960]   You just turn into Yoda after that?
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.200]   How's that possible?
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.520]   Or Noah and the Ark?
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:37.280]   There's something I look at and it's a picture and it like reminds me of why I believe, not
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.880]   because I can explain Noah, but because something happened.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.160]   And I'm going to show you the picture and you're going to be like less like, whoa, oh
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.760]   my gosh, I'm going to pray to receive Christ.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:25:02.520]   But I'll explain why it means this picture is a cross in the emperor's seat in the Roman
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.160]   Coliseum.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.560]   And the Coliseum is a place you can go to and you visit today in Rome.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.340]   You'll see this if you go there.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:21.320]   And the reason why that's like so powerful to me is because the irony, I mean, the Coliseum
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.480]   was a place where thousands of people were murdered.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:32.720]   Thousands of Christians were eaten alive by wild animals where the empire tried to stomp
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:42.100]   out this growing movement where Rome's brutality and strength were displayed for all the world
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.100]   to see.
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:51.340]   And today in the emperor's seat where he would decide whether or not the fate of the person
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:26:01.600]   in the arena would live, sits not a symbol of brutality, but of God's love for the world.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.600]   And it's not just that.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.300]   I mean, think about like, this is why it's so powerful to me.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:12.340]   And you're probably like, I guess if we could go back in time and we could speak to some
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:17.520]   of the men and women who lost their brother, like their actual brother, my brother became
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.820]   a Christian and he was thrown to lions.
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:27.260]   And we could say to some of the people who maybe they lost their parents who were killed
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:31.080]   in the arena or crucified outside the city walls.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:39.060]   And you could say, I know it doesn't look like it, but in a few short years, the empire
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.060]   will fall.
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:47.260]   And where the emperor sits and looks out at the blood of martyrs dripping into the arena,
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:56.140]   there will sit a symbol, a cross, not a cross representing crucifixion or the strength of
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:02.980]   Rome, but a single cross representing a single crucifixion as a symbol of God's love for
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:03.980]   the world.
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.980]   They wouldn't believe it.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.460]   They would not believe it of Jesus.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:13.020]   Wait, who's Jesus?
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.180]   He's a guy from Nazareth.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.180]   What is Nazareth?
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.300]   They could not believe it.
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:20.060]   If we would have told them then years from now, men and women will gather all over the
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.060]   world.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.220]   We're telling these first century Romans and they're going, and what's going to happen?
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.300]   Well, they're going to gather and they're going to tell this story every winter time.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.500]   They're going to sit around as a family and they're going to remember this story.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.060]   And in the story is going to have Caesar Augustus.
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:37.860]   And they're going to go, yeah, of course, first emperor of Rome, but it won't be a story
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.100]   about Caesar.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:48.600]   He will be a footnote in the story of Jesus, the man who changed the world.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:59.120]   When I look back at history, when I look at the fact that we're here today in Rome, it
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:05.080]   is no longer the empire of Rome that has fallen, but now it would become over the centuries,
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.680]   the epicenter of Christianity itself.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.800]   When I think about that, all of my doubts about Jonah and where they're dinosaurs, where
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.400]   are the dinosaurs?
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:21.920]   When I think about that, everything is brought back into focus because I can't explain that.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.560]   And I can give, and there are answers out there.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.240]   If you're wondering, yeah, but what about Jonah?
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.240]   There's answers.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.600]   We give you books and links and sites.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.880]   I can't explain that.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:36.880]   And it changed the course of human history because it changed the lives of everyone who
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:43.480]   saw Jesus and believed in him and trusted him in a top world, the empire.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.440]   I am like kind of nerdy.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:50.200]   And so I like to read the church fathers, church fathers are the guys who took the baton
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.320]   from the disciples.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:56.160]   So Peter and John and James, they handed the baton off to what's called the church fathers.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.760]   And these guys were the disciples of the disciples.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.660]   Does that make sense?
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.000]   They were the ones who sat underneath the leadership.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.280]   And the reason I like to read them is because it reminds me, oh my gosh, Matthew and Mark
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.280]   were real people.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:13.400]   Like they, they're not just like, oh, and there was a guy named Mark and Matthew, but
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.400]   they're real.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:21.380]   And in these church fathers, which are the writings of about 70 AD to about 110, 120,
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.720]   they not only record and reference the new Testament, they quote it and say, as the scripture
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:32.600]   in Matthew says, they not only do that a million times, a million times, they've referenced
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.600]   the scriptures.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:39.760]   They not only do that, but they write about their experiences with Paul and with Peter
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.480]   and with the other disciples.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.240]   And it reminds me that these are real people.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.240]   They write about, Hey, we, I was with Paul.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.400]   We were traveling here and it's not in the Bible.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.640]   This is external, extra biblical things.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:59.400]   It reminds me that my faith is not rooted in a book or it's not written in a book alone.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:05.840]   It's written in history and the anchor of my hope is not just a book.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:14.980]   It is an event, the resurrection of a person, Jesus, the savior of the world.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.960]   And that brings everything back into focus.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:24.000]   And the old Testament, the reason I think the old Testament is trustworthy is not the
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.080]   historicity of it.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.820]   Like it's been proven consistently to match up with what we know about history and not
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.120]   even the archeology of it.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.520]   It's been proven to match up when they discover archeology and they dig for stuff.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.600]   Oh yeah, this is what the Bible said.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.000]   It's not even that.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   It's because Jesus did because Jesus did when he was on this earth, he referenced and believed
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   in the old Testament.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.160]   He indicated he thought it was inspired.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.320]   He said he believed in Adam and Eve.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:55.880]   He said he believed in Jonah and I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but if a guy can
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:03.920]   predict his own death and resurrection and pull it off, I just go with whatever he says.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.680]   I'm in, right?
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.760]   And the reason we believe is not just simply because it's in the Bible.
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.920]   It was added the writings of these men who walked with Jesus and knew him and recorded
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.920]   it.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.980]   Those writings were added later because they were trustworthy.
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.520]   That's why they were added to the Bible.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.040]   And luckily for us, they were bound up so we could carry them around for him.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.300]   But it's not just the Bible.
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:34.640]   It's because Matthew who left his wealth as a tax collector who hated religion and gave
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.080]   it all up and later wrote, I saw Jesus die.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.720]   And then I saw him come back because Mark who wrote out, we believe mainly what Peter
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.720]   experienced.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.680]   He wrote it out for Peter and spent time with Peter.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.680]   He came to believe I saw, and I believe Jesus is my Messiah.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.480]   He came back to life because Luke who said, I don't believe any of this stuff went around
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.480]   interviewing eyewitnesses.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.920]   And at the end of his book, he says, I believe Jesus is my savior.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:00.040]   He died and came back alive because John who was John.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.640]   John was the guy who took care of Mary, the mother of Jesus.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.920]   Who would you trust your mother to?
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.960]   That's who John was.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.960]   He trusted Mary.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.640]   Uh, he was trusted with Mary.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.040]   John wrote my Messiah.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.080]   I saw him die and he came back alive.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.440]   Not just that Peter.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.600]   Think about this Peter who was such a coward.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:23.440]   Why would that even be included in there about him being a little coward to a middle school
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.880]   girl about whether or not he knew Jesus.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:30.200]   And he said, Nope, never seen the guy.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:36.640]   Peter swings around and becomes no longer Peter, the coward, but Peter, the martyr.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:42.000]   After he looked into an empty tomb and he saw his resurrected savior, Paul, who hated
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.120]   Christians swings around and becomes the greatest missionary in the world.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:52.440]   James, the brother of Jesus.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.440]   Maybe you didn't know this.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.880]   Jesus had a younger half brother named James actually had four of them.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:00.960]   And James who for the longest time said, no, I don't believe it.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.960]   And look, he's my brother.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.600]   What would it take you to believe your brother was the son of God?
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.000]   He goes, no, I've seen the kid.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.880]   We played Pete T-ball together.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:09.880]   Not son of God.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.880]   Great guy, but not necessarily.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:19.600]   And then he comes around and says, my brother is my Messiah.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:25.560]   And they all went to their deaths for what they said they saw.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.400]   And all of their disciples who wrote about them.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:34.640]   And we know it gives further evidence to the fact that all of this really took place.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:40.440]   All of their disciples even went to their deaths for what?
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:48.400]   They'd seen and believed that others had seen.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:53.720]   So the application tonight for believers in the room is not even really to do anything.
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:58.240]   It's just to know something that you're not crazy.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:04.840]   And God has written his story, not just in a book, but in history.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.560]   And it's anchored there.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:11.840]   And you can have hope and you don't even have to be able to give a defense for Jonah, Peter
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.840]   says.
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:18.920]   You have to be able to give a defense for the reason you have hope, 1 Peter 3.15 says.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.760]   And that's the resurrection.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:27.240]   And the historical evidence is overwhelming.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:31.920]   If you're skeptical and you're wrestling with something, we would love to talk to you about
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:32.920]   it.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:38.240]   But you know whether you're hiding behind a smoke screen.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.440]   You know.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.520]   And you're just afraid.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.120]   You're afraid that it might be true.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.160]   That might mean you need to change.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.280]   You might have to give something up.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:52.400]   You're afraid of what that could even lead to, which is a tragedy because God, you have
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:58.800]   been sold a lie that God is here to rip you off and he's here to give you life.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.880]   And he's anchored the reality of him and his love for you in history.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:10.080]   Today there is a cross in the emperor seat and the Roman Coliseum.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:14.100]   That is a display of that love that has changed the hearts in this room.
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:19.200]   The Bible has not been changed, but many in this room, our world and history have through
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.560]   the story, the power and the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.720]   And you got to do something with it.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.560]   The Bible is not just a book.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.920]   It's way better than a book.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.520]   And you can trust it.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.360]   I'm going to pray and then we're going to close out.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:42.720]   Father, I thank you for just how much you love us and that you have not just done something
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.960]   and written it down in a book, but you've displayed it perfectly in human history.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:54.940]   You've written it on our hearts and you give us the reason for our hope that you not only
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:36:01.360]   have given us your word, which we can trust because of who wrote it and when it was written,
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:08.800]   but you gave us the living word, which is your son, Jesus, who was in the beginning
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:14.440]   with you and was God and has come to be among us and give himself for us.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.040]   I pray that my friends who don't know that would know it tonight.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.560]   We would trust in that.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:23.060]   Pray that those who are seeking answers, that we would be a safe place to ask those.
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:29.660]   Father, we pray that you would change our city and that the irony of a cross in the
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:39.580]   emperor's seat in a Roman Coliseum and the power of the spirit that changed lives and
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:46.140]   made that a reality would overwhelm and overtake our city, our state, our nation, and our world.
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:46.640]   Amen.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.140]   Amen.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:47.640]   Amen.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:57.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
