[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:28.800]   - All right, well, hey, welcome everybody joining us online.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.720]   We are kicking off a brand new series tonight.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.480]   That is right, therapy,
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.160]   where if there was ever a time our world needed therapy,
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.200]   we have arrived in it.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.360]   And we're gonna be taking week by week,
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.480]   going through therapy sessions, if you will,
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.280]   and walking through mental health, anxiety, depression,
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.440]   what it looks like to be healthy in this space.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.740]   This series was planned even before COVID ever arrived.
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.200]   We planned this back in 2019,
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.040]   and just as God would have it, here we are.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.800]   And so we're gonna walk through what it looks like
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.040]   to address mental health from God's word.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.320]   Let me give you a unique experience of anxiety
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.480]   that happened to me once in my life.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.080]   It was moments or hours really after I had gotten married.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.200]   So the wedding went off without a hitch.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.400]   My wife, Callie, here's a picture of her.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.920]   She looked beautiful.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.040]   You know, the wedding went great.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.660]   The Shane's sang at it.
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.800]   JP, a close friend, did the wedding.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.480]   The reception was awesome.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.720]   It was just a great night and we got married.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.400]   And I woke up the next morning
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.360]   and I was flooded with an emotion I did not expect to have.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.840]   It was the emotion of anxiety.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.200]   Now let me explain how I kind of got there.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.860]   My one contribution to the wedding
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.440]   and this whole process as the groom was the honeymoon.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.960]   In other words, as you would probably guess
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.960]   if you are a girl, typically the bride is the heavy lifter
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.280]   as it relates to invitations, decorations, all that stuff.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.980]   But my one responsibility was the honeymoon.
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.240]   So I was not gonna blow it.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.720]   I had a friend in my life at that time.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.920]   Give me a piece of advice.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.520]   I'm not sure it's biblical advice, but he said,
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.080]   "Hey, look, son, there's two things
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.100]   "that you can't spend too much money on,
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.440]   "an engagement ring and a honeymoon."
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.360]   And although that is clearly not biblical
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.280]   and sounds like the advice Kim Kardashian
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.200]   or someone would give,
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.600]   it was advice that I took to heart.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.760]   And I was like, I'm going big.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.440]   As big as a seminary student working at a church could go.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.380]   So I got as good of a ring as I could.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.000]   And I researched like crazy.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.840]   We were gonna go to the best honeymoon spot possible.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.040]   So I found this place.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.720]   It was like a boutique, gourmet, all-inclusive,
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.840]   amazing resort that, you know,
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.680]   you had your own private butler, 1250 square foot rooms.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.800]   You had your own private pool.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.960]   It was amazing.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.560]   And I just broke the bank saying,
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.560]   "We're going all in on this thing together."
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.120]   And so finally the wedding came.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.840]   And like I said, I woke up the next day
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.880]   and I was flooded with anxiety.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.160]   Not because of who I had married
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.280]   or being worried over, you know, the decision I made.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.920]   I was totally thankful and excited
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.780]   about being married to Kelly.
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.520]   I was anxious about the honeymoon.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.240]   And not because I forgot to pay a bill
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.400]   or forgot something to do,
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   because I was worried about one question.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.620]   What are we gonna do for the next eight days?
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.560]   We were going for eight days to a very secluded
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.420]   60 room boutique.
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.520]   There wasn't a lot of nightlife.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.360]   There wasn't any nightlife.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.440]   And I'm a very active person, like an extra extrovert.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.480]   I like to be on the go, don't rest well,
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.560]   not a fan of massages.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.780]   So the idea of kind of laying around all the time
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.080]   with literally a guy on the beach
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.940]   that would like play a harp
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.360]   and you sit in your bed all day.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.560]   It was terrifying to me.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.800]   And I began to like throw through this plate,
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.280]   like, what are we gonna do?
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.700]   I'm gonna be stuck completely excluded from society.
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.020]   I barely even know this woman.
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.280]   We've been married for 12 hours
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.260]   and we're gonna be tiredly cut off from everything.
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.440]   What am I gonna do?
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.920]   Thankfully, I had included a buffer day
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.840]   after our marriage or after we got married on Saturday night,
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.280]   a buffer day that would allow us to, you know,
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.780]   kind of relax before leaving
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.120]   for the honeymoon on Monday morning.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.000]   Pro tip, I really recommend a buffer day.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.840]   It's just my thing.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.400]   So anyways, on that buffer day,
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.760]   as I'm hit with anxiety, I'm like, man,
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.400]   I need to figure out what we're gonna do.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.120]   So I begin to think through and reach for,
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.960]   well, maybe we could do this, do this.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.040]   I go to Barnes and Noble.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.700]   I buy, no joke, 12 books.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.800]   I don't know what I was thinking.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.600]   It definitely increased the weight of my luggage
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.680]   that I was carrying on.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.500]   Maybe I was thinking,
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.300]   I'll just make this an educational trip or something.
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.800]   That didn't calm my anxiety.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.880]   So then I called AT&T.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.160]   I was like, I need the biggest data international
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.280]   'cause we were going international,
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.160]   international package that you have.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.040]   I'm gonna be cut off.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.080]   I better have service
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.840]   so that I at least have access to the outside world.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.020]   That didn't calm my anxiety.
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.480]   So I just began to download every movie that I could
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.520]   on my computer, on her computer,
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.960]   thinking if nothing else,
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.760]   I guess we'll just catch up on movies we haven't seen,
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.000]   like "Gone With The Wind" and "Forever" or whatever movie.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.240]   And we'll just make this, have a backup of time.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.980]   None of that calmed my anxiety.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.380]   At some point I like broke down in tears to my wife,
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.360]   which it sounds ridiculous 'cause it is ridiculous.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.200]   Well, I'm like sitting there
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.560]   having a borderline closest thing to a panic attack
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.400]   I've ever had going,
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.200]   "I just don't know what we're gonna do
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.560]   for the next eight days."
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.560]   And crying in front of her,
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.240]   which had to make her really feel excited
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.940]   that her new husband is now crying
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.520]   about spending eight days with her
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.560]   in a foreign destination and only her.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.520]   And like, part of me was like,
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.120]   I wonder, you know, could I bring a buddy,
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.240]   like my groomsmen or something?
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.840]   And it just was crazy and irrational.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.980]   But in that moment, I did what anxiety does.
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.120]   It makes us reach for anything that can give us relief.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.160]   Oftentimes because anxiety makes us irrational.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.680]   It makes us reach for irrational things
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.880]   or things that often don't help our anxiety
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.560]   in the midst of feeling overwhelmed or anxious.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.560]   People can turn to different vices
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.880]   or turn to pornography, turn to alcohol,
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.720]   or turn to marijuana.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.440]   We just turn to a codependent relationship.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.940]   Anything that will give us relief.
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.640]   And sadly, relief is seldomly experienced.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.540]   But God loves you.
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.920]   And he talks a lot about anxiety.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.920]   And for the next few weeks,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.300]   we're gonna spend more than one message
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.760]   or session in this therapy series on anxiety
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.340]   before we jump into another topic,
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.680]   because it's such a big issue in our culture.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.040]   And there's not enough that we could do
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.880]   to cover it in one single night.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.560]   If you've ever felt anxiety, you are normal.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.400]   And you are right in line.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.520]   If you've never felt anxiety,
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.720]   you do not live on planet earth.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.240]   And I'm not sure how you're listening to this right now,
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.280]   because for the rest of us,
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.360]   at some point we experience fear, anxiousness, anxiety.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.960]   The American Psychological Association
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.720]   has said that America is the most anxious country
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.000]   on the planet.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.440]   There was a gold medal given out for most anxious.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.240]   We would win it year after year.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.480]   60%, according to the American Psychiatric Association,
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.160]   found that two in three, sorry, young adult,
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.200]   or two in three Americans were anxious
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.260]   or extremely anxious.
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.520]   That means most of us.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.080]   In fact, millennials or young adults
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.420]   and generation right behind them, Gen Z,
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.320]   70% of young adults between the ages of 18 to 34
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.200]   describe themselves as anxious and increasingly anxious.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.640]   And these were taken before COVID ever happened.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.200]   Prescriptions for anti-anxiety medication
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.400]   in the last 15 years have quadrupled in our country.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.120]   Anxiety seems to really be getting worse.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.880]   There's a study done that found that the average child today
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.560]   exhibits the same level of anxiety
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.960]   as the average psychiatric patient in the 1950s.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.160]   This is not a problem, anxiety that's going away.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.560]   It seems to, if anything, be getting worse.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.480]   Much of which people think is probably
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.920]   because of the rapid change.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.240]   Like we live in a world where everything's
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.840]   constantly changing and we're being bombarded
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.760]   all around us with how the world
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.480]   is constantly in turmoil.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.740]   One study found that in the last 30 years,
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.840]   culture has changed as much as the previous 300 combined.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.440]   And change can be stressful, anxiety producing.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.440]   And if that wasn't enough,
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.160]   then you have the young adult years.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.740]   And the reason why this, I think it makes sense,
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.400]   why this time in our life would be
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.520]   even more anxiety producing is because it's a time
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.280]   where you're making so many of the major decisions
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.160]   that you're gonna make in life.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.120]   One study found that 80% of the major decisions
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.680]   you're gonna make are made between the ages of 18 to 35.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.920]   Who you're gonna marry, the career path you're gonna be on,
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.500]   where you're gonna live,
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.500]   shaping the person you're gonna be.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.600]   And those are huge decisions.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.660]   There's not a clear playbook on yes, I'm supposed to
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.780]   or not marry her, what am I supposed to do?
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.600]   We have God's word, but it's not always black and white on,
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.080]   should I work here, take this job or this job?
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.440]   So of course anxiety is gonna spike.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.620]   But what if we're Christians, it doesn't have to.
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.360]   And our heart in this series is for us to look at God's word
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.080]   and give practical truths,
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.680]   practical things that we can reach for
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.040]   in those moments of anxiety
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.120]   that are not an international data plan or books
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.260]   at Barnes and Noble, but things that actually will help us.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.960]   'Cause here's what I know.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.020]   All of us have experienced anxiety.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.380]   You will experience anxious feelings,
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.500]   but I also know that no one wants to.
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.660]   No one is like, hey God, you can have everything in my life
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.020]   and I'm keeping this for me.
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.380]   I'm not giving up my anxiety or my anxious feelings.
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.240]   Like I wanna hold onto this as long as I can.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.900]   Nobody wants that.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.100]   All of us, if we could push a button,
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.880]   we would hit it and say, God, take this from me.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.620]   The good news is God doesn't want you to carry that.
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.460]   And throughout scripture,
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.460]   as we'll see in the next few weeks,
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.780]   he's given clear instructions on how you and I
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.060]   can begin to experience relief from anxiety.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.900]   Tragically, I think the church has failed
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.700]   as it relates to mental health in a lot of ways.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.060]   Failed as it relates to anxiety.
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.020]   And it's an issue that if someone struggles with it
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.940]   too often, our response is to go,
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.980]   hey man, you have struggled with depression or with anxiety.
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.140]   You need to go to a counselor or psychiatrist.
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.140]   You need to go get help from therapists.
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.500]   As though God's word, the Bible,
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.540]   and God's people don't have anything to offer.
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.660]   My wife is a counselor.
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.940]   She's a licensed professional counselor.
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.260]   I've talked about that before.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.420]   Absolutely believe in what she does and love it.
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.300]   But even she would say,
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.320]   and any Christian counselor or counselor
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.140]   who's a Christian worth their salt or worth their weight
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.100]   or knows what they're talking about,
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:58.980]   would say for a Christian,
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.940]   God's word should always be the first line of defense.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.100]   And beyond that, you never outgrow it.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.700]   It should be the thing that we turn to first and foremost.
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.540]   And I think more than often,
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.820]   Christians don't because either they're told,
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.340]   they're pushed in a direction
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.420]   of go find help somewhere else,
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.220]   or they don't understand what the Bible teaches.
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.700]   I don't think a lot of pastors really break down
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.880]   and teach well what the Bible teaches on anxiety.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.460]   So you may have heard something like this.
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.440]   And the Bible says, hey, don't be anxious, just stop.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.780]   Or don't be anxious, just pray.
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.020]   All of which, you know, neither of which are bad things,
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:36.840]   but they don't work.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.980]   And that's not what the Bible teaches.
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.900]   Here's what's true.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.780]   If you could just stop being anxious,
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.680]   you would have already.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.520]   All of us would.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.780]   The good news is the Bible is way more practical,
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:47.700]   way more helpful.
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.940]   And it's one more transformative principles
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.360]   and truths in it.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.200]   That if you and I apply them,
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.780]   they're just that, they're transforming in our life.
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.120]   We're gonna look at one of them tonight.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.620]   We're gonna talk about the idea of recognizing your anxiety.
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.540]   Recognizing, because before you can do anything
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.580]   to address it, you have to recognize it.
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.900]   So we're gonna be in Matthew chapter six,
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.420]   we're gonna walk through three steps
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.740]   that are the first steps for you to experience peace
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.740]   or move down the path of peace.
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.580]   And it involves recognizing your anxiety.
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.020]   The first step is recognize
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.540]   what you're really anxious about.
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.740]   Second being recognize what it is rooted in.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.260]   I'll explain and unpack all those.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.820]   And then recognize what God says about those roots.
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.680]   I already said this, we'll be in Matthew chapter six.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.900]   Matthew six is right in the middle of Jesus' sermon
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.980]   on the Mount, which was a sermon that was written
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.020]   and called Sermon on the Mount.
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:34.860]   Anybody know?
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.060]   You guys gotta start reading your Bible people.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.580]   This is my staff team, they didn't even know.
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.780]   Because Jesus taught it from a mountainside.
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.680]   And he launches into a conversation
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.380]   about lots and lots of topics.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.980]   He brings up, you know, anger and wrath and lust
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.900]   and how to handle relationships.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.180]   And in the middle of it, he brings up anxiety.
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:57.340]   As though people have been anxious for a long time.
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.100]   As long as there was people, there was anxiety and worry.
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.460]   And Jesus launches into a conversation
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.860]   and says some tremendously helpful
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.900]   and really profound things that counseling
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.140]   and psychology today is catching up with.
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.340]   Here's what he says, Matthew chapter six, verse 25.
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.220]   I tell you, do not be anxious about your life,
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.280]   what you will eat or what you will drink
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.860]   or about your body, what you will put on.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:23.720]   Let me hit pause.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.400]   The word anxious, just quickly,
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.500]   is a word that means to meditate
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.580]   or dwell on anxious or fearful thoughts.
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.300]   In other words, it's not Jesus saying,
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.260]   hey, don't be anxious.
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.340]   He's not saying, hey, never have an anxious thought.
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.660]   That's impossible.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.940]   If you thought that's what the Bible teaches,
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.180]   it's not what he's saying.
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.780]   The word is the word marim now.
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.340]   It's a word that means meditate.
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:47.020]   In other literature, it's used as meditation.
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.780]   When Jesus says, hey, don't meditate
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.980]   or don't make a practice in your life
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.660]   meditating on fearful and anxious thoughts.
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.120]   Who would disagree with that?
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.780]   Like if you're quick to dismiss,
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.140]   like, oh, Jesus just said, don't be anxious.
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.740]   No, he said, don't meditate
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.300]   on anxious and fearful thoughts.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.860]   Who in the world would disagree with that?
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.500]   Who would be like, no, that's crazy.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.620]   He would tell me to do that.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.200]   I love meditating on anxious thoughts.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.280]   That's what changed my life.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.500]   Started getting up every morning.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.180]   I spend the first 15 minutes meditating
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.400]   on everything negative, fearful, and anxious that I can
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.340]   that could possibly happen that day.
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.880]   And ever since then, I've been a new man.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.820]   No, that's insane.
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.660]   Jesus is saying what all of us know.
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.660]   It's not a good use of time or your life
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.760]   to spend time meditating on fearful and anxious thoughts
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.260]   about what you will eat and what you will drink.
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.860]   Now he addresses what his audience is worried about.
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.820]   To us, he would say, hey, don't spend time meditating
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.980]   on how much longer you're gonna be single.
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.420]   Don't spend time meditating on focus on like,
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.620]   what if I never ended up getting married?
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.460]   Or what if I never have kids?
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.340]   Or what if I don't get the job
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.780]   and maybe in my room, it's gonna move out.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:47.940]   And what if I ended up getting Corona?
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.700]   And what, don't spend time meditating
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.060]   and focusing on those things.
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.140]   They're gonna pop in your head.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.420]   But you have a decision whether or not
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.740]   you're gonna choose to grab on and dwell on them.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.100]   And he says, don't do that.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.580]   And he addresses their worries.
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.980]   To us, he would bring up whatever you're anxious about.
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.140]   Your parents' relationship not working out.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.580]   How much is in your bank account
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.560]   and whether or not you're gonna have enough.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.580]   Whether you're on track to retire at the age you want.
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.940]   Whether the relationship is gonna work out.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.300]   He's not saying don't care.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.660]   He's not saying don't be responsible.
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.040]   Do both of those.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.480]   But he's saying you don't have to focus
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.320]   and meditate and dwell.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.880]   And he's saying, don't do that.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:30.720]   And then he asked a question that I think is so profound.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.080]   Isn't life more than food?
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.900]   And the body more than clothing?
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.640]   Again, he brings up their worries.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.920]   As he would say, isn't life more than getting married?
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.940]   Isn't life more than having that new job?
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.320]   Isn't life more than getting a pay raise?
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.080]   Isn't life more than driving the right car?
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.520]   Isn't life more than owning a home?
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.480]   Isn't life, whatever you're worried about.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.680]   It's not that those things are unimportant,
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.960]   but it's a really brilliant question.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.160]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.360]   Why do you think Jesus asks that question?
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.640]   Like, he's sitting there in front of an audience.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.520]   He says, hey, you're spending so much time
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.800]   dwelling and focusing on whether or not
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.880]   you have enough to eat or whether or not
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.480]   you may run out of clothes.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.420]   What you're spending your life on.
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.180]   Isn't life so much more than those things?
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.120]   Do you think Jesus is really looking for an answer?
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.600]   Like, is he like, guys, I don't know.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.480]   Is that all life is about?
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.800]   No.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.180]   It's safe to assume he's Jesus, which means he's God,
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.080]   so he knows the answer.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:29.920]   It's a brilliant question,
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.740]   'cause what does that question do?
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.080]   It forces his audience to put into perspective
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.020]   the object of their anxiety, their worry.
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.160]   Because the answer it leads to is,
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.880]   well, no, I mean, life is more than food.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.840]   In other words, like, no one here would say
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.040]   that all that life is about is making sure
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.800]   you got enough food, as long as you have enough grain
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.960]   for the rest of your life.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.240]   That's the epitome of a great life.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.920]   No one would say that.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.820]   It's an important part of life, but it doesn't equal life.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.560]   Just like for us, we'd go, yeah, I mean,
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.440]   no, marriage doesn't equal life.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.120]   It's an important part, and it would be a great part,
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.120]   but no, it's possible to live a good life
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.040]   and not be married like Jesus did or like Paul did.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.400]   It forces, when you think about it,
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.560]   it puts into perspective, like,
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.720]   you guys are spending all of your life
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.860]   focused on what are we gonna eat?
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:17.960]   What are we gonna eat?
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.000]   Where am I gonna work?
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.120]   Where am I gonna work?
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.520]   And you're actually giving your life away
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.120]   for something that's draining, sucking,
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.000]   and choking the life out of you.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.320]   The word worry or anxiety in English
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.920]   comes from a German word that means to choke out.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.680]   And Jesus' point is like, don't spend and focus your life
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.200]   or give your life focused on worrying
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.300]   or dwelling on negative thoughts.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.960]   It's his attempt to help them better recognize,
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.600]   that's our word, recognize your anxiety,
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.760]   to see it more clearly than it is.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.360]   'Cause here's what happens when we get worried or anxious,
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.840]   it becomes really hard to see anything
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.780]   other than the thing I'm anxious about.
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.400]   I leave a presentation at work,
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.360]   I leave wondering what does my boss think about me?
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.480]   And I begin to think of like,
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.800]   oh, I bet they didn't like me at all.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.200]   I bet I'm gonna get fired from my job.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.300]   I better update my LinkedIn profile picture.
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.860]   I never know what my LinkedIn password is.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:08.700]   Where am I gonna?
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.520]   It begins to be like, all I can think about is that.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.240]   And Jesus is just trying to pull his audience back,
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.100]   see more clearly.
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.100]   The mind is a funny thing,
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.340]   especially as it relates to anxiety.
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:25.040]   It like quickly can take something really small
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.480]   and blow it up really big.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.500]   I was told, I read recently that a single glass of water
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:36.500]   is enough to create a dense fog that's a hundred feet tall
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.860]   in seven city blocks wide.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.900]   If you're in New York City,
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.820]   if you've ever been to a big city and you got seven blocks,
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.360]   you know, you're on the grid system,
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.900]   seven blocks long, a hundred feet tall,
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.740]   one glass of water stretched into millions and millions
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.640]   and millions and millions of droplets.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.900]   It's really a picture of what fear
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.380]   and what our mind can do with fearful and anxious thoughts.
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.500]   Once a thought comes into the fog machine of fear,
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.020]   it gets stretched and pulled and pulled
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:04.860]   in every different direction.
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.080]   And so all of a sudden it's like, man,
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.380]   we had a really bad date.
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.340]   I thought this relationship was gonna go somewhere.
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.600]   That enters into the fog machine of fear.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.940]   And I begin to go, oh my gosh,
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.100]   I'm gonna end up breaking up with him.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.600]   He's probably the last chance I got.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.720]   I got no one else after him.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.720]   I'm gonna be the single cat lady for the rest of my life.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.200]   And all of a sudden this interaction that you had
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.640]   as you were leaving a date becomes,
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.200]   I'm gonna be alone forever and ever.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.220]   Your roommate's moving out
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.840]   and it enters into the fog machine of fear.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.880]   And all of a sudden the thought goes from,
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.400]   what am I gonna do once my roommate moves out
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.880]   to be able to afford rent?
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.040]   'Cause I'm splitting it now.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.460]   How am I gonna afford?
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.720]   That thought enters the fog machine of fear in our minds.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.120]   And it comes to, oh my gosh,
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.280]   I'm not gonna be able to live here.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.320]   If I don't find somebody,
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.600]   I'm gonna end up getting kicked to the curb
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.780]   'cause I can't afford my lease.
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.280]   I need to find somebody to live with.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.020]   I don't know anyone who needs a place to live right now.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.760]   Maybe I could look on Facebook or post something
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.760]   or post something on Craigslist.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.880]   That feels like a recipe for having a psychotic person
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.340]   move in and murder me in my sleep.
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.860]   My options are being murdered in my sleep or be homeless.
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.080]   And all of a sudden this, what am I gonna do?
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.440]   Enters in and gets stretched and stretched and stretched.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.800]   But listen, listen, listen.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.380]   What if it doesn't have to?
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.340]   What if it was possible in that moment
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.740]   to see your fear more clearly?
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.880]   To see it not as this huge fog, but as a glass of water?
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:28.700]   Jesus's attempt with his audience here is to do just that.
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.900]   To help them recognize, why are you anxious?
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.100]   It's really behind that.
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.180]   Because once you get it down to a glass of water,
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.220]   it's still there.
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.420]   You still have to find a roommate.
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.620]   You still may have had a date that didn't end
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.620]   as well as you wanted to,
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.380]   but it's a lot easier to deal with
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.480]   and to deflate some of the power that it has on it.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.660]   Jesus did what counselors today, like I said earlier,
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.780]   my wife is a counselor.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.720]   And if you go see her,
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.660]   she would do, or many counselors do something similar
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.980]   where they try to ask questions
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:03.220]   with the goal of deflating the power of your worry.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.660]   If you express like, I'm anxious about this,
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.900]   they'll ask you questions
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.860]   and help you try to recognize more and more
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.620]   and see more clearly about,
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.540]   or see more clearly the thing that you're anxious about.
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.380]   And I'll explain what I mean,
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.900]   but I'm about to give you $120 an hour worth of counseling
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:19.860]   right now for free.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.100]   So if you just tuned in, it's at least worth your time
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.500]   'cause you're about to get what it would take $120
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.580]   or cost you 120 bucks for free right now.
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.540]   Let's say you went in and you were anxious
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.980]   'cause there's a lot of layoffs going on right now
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.820]   with COVID and with business and with all of that.
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:34.900]   And you went to see a counselor
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.860]   'cause you were anxious about losing your job.
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.300]   And you sat down with that counselor and you were like,
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.340]   man, I'm anxious about whether or not
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.900]   I'm gonna be able to keep my job or I may get laid off.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.700]   There's layoffs coming.
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.500]   The counselor would sit down and she'd say, or he'd say,
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.740]   what happens if you get laid off?
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.620]   And you begin to go, well, I wouldn't be able to afford rent
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.980]   and I'd have to move out of where I'm living
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.500]   and I probably would have to move back in with my parents.
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.860]   And they'd respond with,
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.580]   what happens if you have to move back in with your parents?
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.420]   Well, then I'd feel like a total failure.
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.220]   And I would, everyone's gonna be like,
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.540]   I'm the guy who failed in life
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.540]   and I moved back in with my parents and I'm 28 years old.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.180]   And all of a sudden my life, like I'm just a failure.
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.460]   You know, it's funny.
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.180]   And that made up storyline that I just gave there,
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.260]   he goes in and he thinks I'm anxious about losing my job.
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.340]   He's really anxious about being seen as a failure
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.180]   or he's really anxious
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.940]   about what other people think about him.
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:34.980]   In order for him to address and face or fight his anxiety,
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:39.620]   he's gotta be able to face what he's actually anxious about.
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.180]   In other words, he's anxious over what others think.
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:45.740]   If he's gonna chase down and experience freedom from that,
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:50.060]   he's got to be able to see what am I actually anxious about?
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.060]   The first idea from this, from this text,
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.060]   as I already said, was recognizing
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.000]   what am I anxious about really?
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.740]   Jesus over and over throughout the gospels
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.460]   asks a really funny questions to his disciples.
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.000]   On multiple occasions, there's like scary stuff going on.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.500]   They're on a boat in Matthew chapter eight.
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.740]   And we're told that, I mean,
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.100]   these are all professional fishermen, Jesus's disciples,
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.020]   or most of them were like, they've been on a boat.
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.620]   They get it, they've been in rocky waters.
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.820]   And we're told this storm that was crazy.
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.920]   It was like an earthquake, the text says,
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.260]   on the water was out there.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.340]   And Jesus is asleep in the middle of the boat on a pillow.
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.180]   That's what we're told in the verses.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.020]   And they're over there
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.340]   and all the disciples are panicking, freaking out.
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.500]   And they wake up Jesus and they're like,
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.020]   Jesus, we're all gonna die.
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.860]   And he wakes up, wipes the sleep out of his eyes
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.740]   and says, peace, be still.
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.580]   And he tells the wind and waves and water to stop
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:48.580]   like he's talking to a toddler and everything stops.
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:52.940]   Then he asks a really interesting question.
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:58.860]   He looks at his guys, says, why are you afraid?
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:05.180]   Jesus, you're God, so you know everything anyways.
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.140]   Why would you ask a question like that?
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.780]   That's like, hey, there's an earthquake happening
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.580]   and stuff tumbling all around us and we're all terrified.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.600]   And all of a sudden it stops and you come up
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.220]   and you're like, why were you afraid?
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.620]   Because I'm in an earthquake
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.020]   and things are falling all around.
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.900]   What do you, that's an insensitive, dumb question.
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.340]   Why are you even asking that?
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.860]   Jesus was helping his disciples see,
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.620]   what are you afraid of?
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.860]   My guess is they would say of dying.
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.360]   Why are you afraid of dying?
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.260]   I've already told you, you're gonna be with me forever
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.600]   and ever and ever.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.940]   You know that I'm in control of everything,
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:39.900]   including the wind and the waves
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.580]   and every day that you live.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.120]   Why are you afraid?
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.220]   The same question you've got to chase down.
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.920]   If you experience anxiety every time,
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.460]   there's something beneath the surface.
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.080]   So you got to know, why am I afraid?
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.120]   What am I anxious about really?
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.300]   And maybe a really helpful exercise would be
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.200]   for you to sit down and go,
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.340]   I'm anxious about because blank.
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.720]   I'm anxious about because blank.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.060]   I'm anxious to talk at my workplace
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.180]   because I'm afraid of what my boss will think.
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.540]   Because I'm afraid my idea might not be great.
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.580]   I'm anxious about getting married
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.460]   because I'm afraid I'm gonna get divorced like my parents.
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.240]   I'm anxious about being single the rest of my life
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.300]   because I'm afraid I'm gonna die alone.
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:25.500]   In order for you to address any of those anxieties,
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.500]   and we're gonna talk about how to address them,
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.200]   you at first have to recognize
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.060]   and be willing to accept them.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.220]   You cannot address what you won't accept.
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.220]   And too many Christians try to pretend
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.780]   like I'm not anxious about something.
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.060]   Often because other Christians tell them,
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.300]   like you need to stop being anxious
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.720]   and stop worrying about things, which is not helpful.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.900]   They would stop if they could.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.560]   And telling them stop doesn't help them.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.060]   No one has ever told me the story of like,
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.580]   you know what fixed my anxiety?
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.540]   Shame.
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.100]   I just had people around me saying,
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.580]   you should be ashamed of yourself for being, no.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.980]   People would tell them like, you should stop being anxious.
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.220]   That just makes them more anxious
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:02.940]   about the fact they're anxious.
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.580]   So here's what I want you, I want you to accept.
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.640]   You may have never heard somebody ever tell you that before.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.440]   Accept your anxiety so that you can address it.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.000]   Hiding it or pretending it's not there
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.380]   is not more spiritual.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.620]   It's living in denial, denial.
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.120]   What are you anxious about?
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.860]   Really?
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.540]   Step two, so once you know now the roots of your anxiety,
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.740]   that involves saying, I'm gonna address
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.220]   what's underneath those.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.540]   Anxiousness, fear, and worry, they're all emotions.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.940]   So every time I experienced the emotion of worry
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.180]   or anxiety, it's an emotion.
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.540]   Here's what you gotta know about emotions.
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.340]   This is gonna be thinking cap on,
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.700]   and we're gonna move through quickly
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.460]   the root of your anxiety, like what's underneath it?
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:46.100]   'Cause you can't fix it if you don't address the roots.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.780]   Emotion or anxiety is an emotion.
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.060]   Every emotion you experience
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.060]   involves the intersection of two things.
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.380]   It involves something you believe
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.440]   intersecting with something you value.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.940]   You cannot experience emotion,
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.260]   and you cannot experience anxiety,
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.180]   'cause anxiety's an emotion,
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.420]   without it involving something I believe
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.060]   about something I value.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.060]   You can't experience freedom from anxiety
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.900]   without addressing something you believe
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.180]   intersecting with something you value,
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.780]   'cause it's an emotion.
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.940]   Let me explain, 'cause you're probably like,
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:17.780]   what, is it really?
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.480]   Let me think of an example.
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.420]   Every time you feel anxiety,
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.420]   there's something you value, it's place.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.420]   So when I go outside today, when I get home,
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.420]   or tonight, or tomorrow,
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.300]   if I see a squirrel running in the street,
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.420]   I feel nothing, I'm not anxious, I don't feel anything.
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.260]   Even if I wanted to feel anxious, I wouldn't feel anxiety.
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.340]   I would feel like, oh, it's a squirrel,
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.620]   that's what they do, it's kind of their thing.
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.060]   They run back and forth, they look for acorns,
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.780]   or whatever they're doing, I would feel nothing.
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:46.220]   If I see a child that I value way more than a squirrel
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.500]   running in the street, I'm gonna feel fear, concern.
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.820]   I'm gonna run towards him, say, get out of the street.
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:53.900]   Could be a car coming.
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:59.180]   When I see my child, something of incredible value to me,
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.900]   something I value, running in the street,
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.260]   I feel tremendous fear.
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.940]   It's gonna move me out of that emotion to act,
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.020]   to yell, to run, and pull them out of the street,
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:12.820]   because I feel something I value is being threatened.
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.340]   It also involves a belief.
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.780]   What do I mean by that?
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.500]   I mean, if I see my wife with our kids,
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.340]   they're out in the front yard,
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.380]   they're walking through the lawn,
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.300]   and you know, on our grass,
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.040]   and she's walking towards what I believe is a snake,
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.900]   and I see it from afar,
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.140]   and I see what I believe is a snake
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.740]   intersecting with someone I value, my wife,
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.980]   I'm going to feel anxiety and yell,
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.460]   don't go closer, that's a snake,
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.980]   because something I value is intersecting
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.980]   about something I believe it could be, or it is a snake.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:45.900]   Here's what's really interesting,
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.860]   this really profoundly helpful as it relates to anxiety.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.500]   Whether or not it is a snake doesn't matter.
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:59.180]   If I believe it is, or I believe it could be,
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.060]   I'll feel anxiety.
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.660]   It's not about what's true, whether it is a snake or not,
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:08.800]   it's about what I believe, or what I believe could be true.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.900]   So if you're gonna conquer,
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.140]   if you want to experience freedom from anxiety,
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.420]   if you want to take steps in the direction of peace,
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.680]   you're gonna have to address,
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.680]   what am I believing, and what am I valuing underneath this?
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.260]   Like what is informing this?
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:28.220]   And if you do, you will begin to experience freedom,
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.620]   or more peace, every time you feel anxiety,
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.460]   that's underneath there.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.700]   Here, and here's further why this is important.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.300]   You're what you believe and what you value,
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.780]   even if you've been walking with Jesus for a long time,
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:40.900]   we're all a byproduct of the world environment,
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.040]   the family we grew up in.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.540]   Like we were shaped, we didn't even know,
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.900]   like none of us woke up today and was like,
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.140]   you know what, I believe some things,
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.660]   and I think I value some things.
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.780]   They were formed our entire life.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.540]   You were raised in a family,
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:52.860]   where they never told you,
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.100]   believe money is the most important thing, son.
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.100]   But you heard phrases like,
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.620]   son, the most important thing you can do
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.820]   is get a good job that's stable,
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.280]   to be able to put food on the table.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.100]   And you heard most important thing I can do.
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.980]   And somewhere along the line, you began to go like,
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.780]   that is the most important thing I can do.
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:14.500]   And now if your job is threatened,
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.180]   or money is threatened,
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.820]   because you some point picked up,
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.700]   and it began to impact the way you think,
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.940]   what you believe, you feel anxiety,
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.140]   because you were shaped by parents,
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.220]   or by people, by friends who said,
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.120]   hey, this is the most important thing.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.900]   And now you're anxious if it's threatened.
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.940]   So two people can be in the same exact circumstance,
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.180]   and one be anxious and one not,
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.740]   'cause they have different beliefs, different values.
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.700]   Some of you were raised in a home where,
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.300]   you know, you were taught,
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.940]   conflict is a really bad thing.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.980]   You know, you don't fight, you never have conflict.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.720]   Or your parents always hid it from you.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.620]   Or you're raised in a home where they fought all the time.
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.060]   They fought in a way that wasn't healthy,
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.500]   and it really scarred you.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.900]   And now today, anytime you're in a dating relationship,
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.420]   and you start having conflict, you get really anxious,
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.180]   and you wanna leave the dating relationship,
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.780]   because you believe that conflict is a bad thing.
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.780]   That's not what the Bible teaches.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.220]   It says conflict can be a good thing.
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:08.780]   It's a chance to honor God, and it's a chance
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.860]   to grow closer, but you picked up at some point,
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.140]   without even knowing it, conflict is a bad thing.
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.500]   So now you feel anxiety.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.760]   If you don't wanna feel anxiety
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.580]   when you have conflict in a relationship,
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.020]   you won't just stop.
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.540]   You won't just, I won't anymore.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.420]   You gotta address, oh, I feel anxiety,
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.220]   'cause I believe conflict is a bad thing.
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:33.300]   You have to address the roots that are underneath those,
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.240]   if you want to experience freedom from anxiety.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.640]   So quick recap, to remove anxious thoughts,
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.460]   we have to recognize what am I anxious about, really?
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.660]   What am I anxious about?
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:48.780]   And then I have to recognize what are the roots,
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.100]   like what are the beliefs?
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.700]   What am I believing and valuing?
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:55.100]   I'm anxious about getting married,
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.940]   'cause I wanna have kids, 'cause I don't think
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.100]   life is worth living if I don't have kids.
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.680]   Is that true?
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:06.540]   It's what you believe, but it may not be true.
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.080]   It's not true.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.720]   Life is not worth living if you can't have kids.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.100]   Jesus' life was not worth living.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.700]   The Apostle Paul's life was not worth living.
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:15.640]   That's ridiculous.
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.780]   But somewhere in there, you may believe that.
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.260]   And so you gotta address, where am I believing a lie?
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.500]   How do I know if it's a lie?
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.700]   It gives us step three.
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:29.980]   You recognize what God says about those roots.
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.540]   I take all those beliefs, I take,
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.540]   I don't know that life is worth living if I don't have kids.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.340]   What would the Bible say about that?
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:39.540]   And I take the Bible and I begin to put it up and go,
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.300]   oh, it says kids are a blessing from the Lord,
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.340]   but they're not the source of life.
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.420]   They're not even what life is about.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.660]   You can have the abundant life and never have kids.
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.760]   Wow, I bought a lie.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:55.960]   It says that money's not the source of security God is.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.380]   So now when my job is threatened,
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.860]   I don't have to experience anxiety,
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.000]   or if I'm concerned about money,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.180]   I'm not gonna experience anxiety
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:06.200]   because I am applying what the Bible says,
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.100]   which is God is the source of security and provision,
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:09.940]   not money.
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.620]   That's the truth.
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.500]   You may not believe it, which is why when not,
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.300]   when your bank account goes up and down,
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.500]   you begin to get worried
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.780]   'cause you don't believe God
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.220]   is the ultimate source of provision,
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.500]   but that's the truth.
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.340]   And if you wanna experience freedom
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.780]   from that anxiety you feel,
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.380]   you gotta go at those beliefs
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.200]   with the truth from God's word,
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.700]   or you can just keep worrying.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:39.860]   In Hebrews chapter four, verse 12,
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.020]   we're about to land the plane.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.240]   It says the word of God, the Bible even says,
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.580]   hey, I was designed, God's word was designed
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:50.340]   to help you cut the roots of your anxious feelings,
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.460]   to get at them and give you freedom from them.
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.540]   It says the word of God is sharper
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.820]   than any double-edged sword.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.620]   It pierces through even dividing the soul
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.260]   from spirit and joints from marrow.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.500]   How cool does that sound?
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.580]   Braveheart.
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.600]   It's able to discern, listen to this,
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.540]   it is able to sift through or discern
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:13.420]   or judge the desires and thoughts of the heart.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.080]   The desires, that's the things you value.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:22.080]   And the thoughts, that's the beliefs of your heart.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.080]   It's able to go through and go, hey, this is actually a lie.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:24.920]   That's not actually true.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.740]   Conflict's not a bad thing.
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.320]   Hey, what other people think about you?
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.080]   It shouldn't own you and it shouldn't wreck you
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.520]   'cause you should be living according to the Bible
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.920]   in Galatians one, for God and an audience of him.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.800]   And other people, whether they think good about you or bad,
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.620]   it shouldn't wreck your life.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.500]   And God ultimately controls even what people think about you
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.000]   and you begin to take all those truths.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.500]   And all of a sudden, instead of anxiety, when I'm leaving,
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.900]   I'm going, my job isn't the source of security in my life.
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.480]   God is, he owns everything there is.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.140]   He could give me a million dollars tomorrow
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.140]   if he wanted to, or he could just give me,
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.380]   whatever a million could lead to.
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.100]   He's a source of provision in my life
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.740]   because I'm attacking whatever lies are underneath there.
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:09.220]   And every time I experience anxiety right now,
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.140]   if you feel it this week,
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:14.760]   it tells you something you value,
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.500]   you believe is possibly threatened.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.280]   And now I take all of that and I begin to go,
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.460]   what would God say about this?
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.300]   How does God's word inform this?
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.920]   That's why we're so big on community group.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.840]   That's why we're big on like you being equipped
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.040]   'cause it takes work to know what does the Bible say?
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:33.060]   Go to watermark.org/equipping.
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.160]   If you're interested in knowing, like, man,
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.980]   I wanna know my Bible better to be able to do this better.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.600]   Ultimately, it's like this.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.660]   I hope you walk away from this message
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.020]   'cause it's just a starter.
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:52.540]   When I go to the mall, I hate going to the mall,
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:53.940]   by the way, who likes going to the mall here?
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.500]   I bet you like going to the mall.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.860]   You like going to the mall?
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.100]   You love going to the mall.
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.540]   Yeah, you do.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:03.980]   No, Josiah, you love, yo.
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.780]   I hate going to the mall.
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:06.780]   Here's one of the reasons why.
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.500]   I don't know, I get this feeling every time I walk in there,
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.020]   it's like I can't breathe.
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.900]   It's like the walls are closing in.
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:17.140]   It's like a weird Vegas meets clothing everywhere.
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.620]   There's no windows anywhere
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:19.900]   and I don't know where I'm going
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.380]   and I go up one escalator
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.300]   and it just takes me to a top of another place
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.100]   and I just like, I don't feel comfortable.
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.540]   It's probably like control issues
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.740]   where I don't know exactly where I am right now
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.100]   and if I can avoid it, I avoid it
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.060]   and I don't wanna brag.
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.780]   It's been pretty successful in being able to avoid it
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:37.580]   and that I do all of my shopping online.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:38.660]   I don't go to the mall.
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:39.540]   I never go to the mall.
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.380]   I can't tell you the last time
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.260]   I even went shopping at the mall
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:45.620]   with one exception, the Apple store.
[00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:48.020]   Every year at some point, inevitably,
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.980]   my screen on my phone will crack or something will happen
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:54.180]   and I'm so ingrained in my life with Apple
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.020]   that I have to end up going to the store
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.340]   'cause you can't just send it in.
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.420]   I have to go to the mall
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.620]   and I do the same thing every time.
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:00.460]   I never know where to park,
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.420]   so I call my wife, ask where do I park.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.380]   If I can't get her on the phone,
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.060]   I'm like, well, I'll just roll the dice again
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.900]   and I end up parking the entirely opposite direction
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.500]   of wherever the Apple store is
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.580]   and I get out of the car and I go in there
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.140]   and try to figure out where do I go now
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:15.660]   and I go up to me and your grandma.
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.220]   Go to the last physical map in society,
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:20.220]   that little kiosk thing and it has a whole map
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.340]   and double layers and you're like,
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.340]   oh, where am I right now?
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.140]   Glasses on and I try to figure out where am I
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.860]   and every time I look at that map, I do two things.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:33.700]   I look, where is the Apple store and where am I?
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.020]   You know that little star that says you're here?
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:37.660]   I look, where's the Apple store and where am I?
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.820]   Because it's not just important of, oh, Apple store.
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:44.760]   That is of no value unless I know, oh, me.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.520]   If I don't know where I am,
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.660]   I cannot get to where I want to be.
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.240]   This is how it is in terms of anxiety.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.880]   If you don't recognize where you are,
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.180]   I'm anxious about this.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.420]   I'm anxious about whether or not
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.540]   I'm gonna have a job next year.
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.620]   I'm anxious about whether or not
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.180]   I'm gonna be afforded to continue to save.
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:01.200]   I'm anxious about whether or not
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.660]   this relationship's gonna work out.
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:06.000]   If you're unwilling to say, this is where I am.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.920]   I'm right here, I wanna go right here.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.420]   You're never gonna get to where you wanna go.
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.120]   You're never gonna move in the direction of peace
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:17.020]   in that illustration because you won't accept where you are.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.280]   And this entire first message is just,
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.220]   you've gotta recognize, why am I anxious?
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.660]   Recognize, what are the roots below that anxiety?
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.540]   And then recognize, what would God's word say about that?
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.420]   If you wanna experience freedom,
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:31.460]   that is not gonna end it.
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:32.820]   It's not gonna make every anxious feeling
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.220]   you ever have go away, but it will help you take a step
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:36.940]   because you can't get to where you wanna go
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.180]   if you won't accept where you are.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.580]   And God's word in that map illustration,
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.580]   it's like God's word becomes the guiding line of,
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:47.760]   oh, this is what I need to do.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.100]   It helps me understand how far off I am
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.420]   and how do I get to a place of peace?
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.100]   And it takes day by day by day,
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.180]   which is why at the end of this passage,
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.060]   Jesus says, it's gonna take one day at a time,
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.940]   one day at a time.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.460]   Therefore, don't be anxious about tomorrow.
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.760]   It's got enough to worry about.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.760]   You focus on today.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.740]   But first you gotta recognize, what am I anxious about?
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.300]   Others of you, you need to recognize,
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.140]   and you're tuning in,
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.640]   the biggest thing you need to walk away with is not,
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:19.100]   hey, how do I get to where I wanna be in terms of peace?
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.540]   You need to recognize that where you are
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:24.380]   in relationship with God is you have been separated
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.260]   and cut off because you've never accepted
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:29.500]   what Jesus did on the cross, dying for you.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.140]   Why do I say you've been separated?
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.420]   The Bible teaches, our life experience shows us
[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.500]   that anytime sin comes into a relationship,
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:40.280]   like you've wronged somebody, it hurts the relationship.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.660]   All of us in our lives have sinned in a way
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.780]   over and over and over that it's hurt our,
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:48.200]   it's cut us off from a perfect, loving, holy God.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.820]   That's where you are on the map.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.580]   The good news is God sent his son into the world
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.340]   so that you wouldn't have to be separated from him.
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.540]   He could bring you home,
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:01.220]   but the only way that you could be reconnected or restored,
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.160]   end up at the place you want to be,
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.620]   is by putting your faith in what Jesus did
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.660]   on the cross for you, for me.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:12.460]   He died for everything you ever did, and he paid for it.
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.540]   And what you need to walk away is not,
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:15.140]   how do I not be anxious?
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.820]   But how can I have eternal life?
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:21.580]   'Cause you're gonna keep being anxious in this life,
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.120]   'cause the biggest thing that you should worry about
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:27.900]   is no one, or you are the person who's paying for your sins,
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.400]   and you don't have enough in the bank to pay for 'em.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.660]   God already paid more than enough,
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.460]   and he's invited you, trust in me,
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.020]   and you'll experience peace in this life
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.380]   and for all of eternity, as you walk with me,
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.460]   and eventually for all of eternity.
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.780]   If that's where you are, tonight is your night,
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:45.620]   and by faith, you can just say,
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:48.460]   "God, I'm a sinner, I trust you.
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:51.760]   "I want your help, I want you to do therapy in my life,
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.460]   "and I want you to restore me to a relationship with you."
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.300]   Let me pray.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.500]   Father, I pray for every person listening right now,
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:02.240]   anxiety is such a huge part of all of our lives at times,
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.180]   and many of us right now.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.540]   Would you pierce through our fear?
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:12.160]   Help us see you through the midst of all of it.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.500]   Help us to be willing to accept, I'm anxious about this,
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:19.500]   and then help us to be diligent and earnest to address,
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.920]   what does God's word say about this?
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.440]   Am I maybe believing a lie?
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:30.000]   I'm afraid of losing something that you say is important,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.400]   but it's not all that life is about.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.440]   Would you help me?
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.320]   Would you help my friends?
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.520]   Would you be more real than the fear right now?
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.720]   We love you, thank you for Jesus,
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.560]   who's made a way for all of us to get
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.840]   back to a relationship with you forever.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.480]   The one who wants us to experience peace,
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.200]   the one called the Prince of Peace.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.840]   Would we walk with him and experience that now, amen.
