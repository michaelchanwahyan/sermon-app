[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   For freedom in the history of our nation
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:11.040]   Dallas and Fort Worth advancing the state of the art in every aspect
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:22.820]   Come on
[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.960]   Come on. Come on
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.960]   Hey, listen, if you are hearing me right now
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.880]   If you are hearing me right now either in this room in Fort Worth somewhere around the world
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.040]   It is due to an amazing tech team here locally or wherever you're at another campus or gathering
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.040]   Let's just give it up for our tech guys, man
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:48.560]   We want to see Jesus change the world through the lives of young adults
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.540]   We believe that he's doing that and we are watching a movement continue to grow outside the walls of Dallas Fort Worth
[00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.080]   And so tonight we have a gathering that's kicking off in El Paso, Texas
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.480]   We have one in spring, Texas, Tulsa, Oklahoma
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.920]   The woodlands our friends in Houston, Texas
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.800]   We love you, and I cannot forget our dear dear friends our partners in ministry in Fort Worth, Texas Garrett Rayburn
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.160]   Thank you for your leadership there
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.040]   We love you guys is so fun to gather in the name of Jesus and worship and sing
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.240]   Love songs to a God who created us and to look at his words and say hey, what do you have for me?
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.040]   What do you want to do with my life?
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.720]   and so
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.640]   Man, it was a great break
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.180]   I hope you had a great break and I'll just start by telling you a little bit about our family any any dog people here
[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.560]   All right, all right any cat people here
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.760]   Okay, we're just gonna have a moment to pray for the cat people, okay
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.640]   No, I'm kidding our family. We're we're bird people
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.100]   Okay, if we are friends online or something, you know, we're a bird family
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.600]   And so my nine-year-old has a parakeet named turquoise. All right, we haven't graduated to parrot yet
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.800]   We got a parakeet named turquoise. She loves turquoise what that looks like is she comes down
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.120]   Every morning gets turquoise out of his cage and she has breakfast with turquoise
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.600]   Okay, that's our parakeet and her parakeet specifically and and turquoise will fly around the house, but not for long
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.240]   It's really interesting when she gets turquoise out of the cage no matter where she takes him
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.520]   He will fly back to his cage. Okay, and it's a complicated flight path
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.840]   you got to go around the refrigerator down a hallway and turn into the utility room and then kind of
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.320]   Swing a tight left and then stop and and he's nailed it like he's got that down. He loves his cage
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.140]   He loves his cage. And and so as soon as Presley gets him out
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.040]   He will be back to the cage and you know, I can't blame him because we're good cage keepers, right?
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.440]   We've got toys in there for him. We change the food and water daily
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.400]   We change the bedding weekly and and we've even bought him a friend a white parakeet named icing
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.760]   okay, and so we have set turquoise up and and
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.580]   Presley Presley took turquoise outside one day
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.320]   Big mistake and mama was like Presley. What are you doing? You can't just take him outside
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.080]   He's gonna he's gonna fly off and I mean as soon as she said the words fly off turquoise was gone
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.960]   I mean, bye-bye birdie like I'm talking straight through to the horizon over the houses
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.880]   Just gone like just just off like back to the Amazon or wherever parakeets come from
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.880]   I mean this bird was gone and and you laugh but it was really sad because Presley sitting there
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.040]   I mean her eyes start welling up with tears and she's like mommy mommy. What do I do? Mommy?
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.560]   What do I do then? My wife's like, oh get in the car, you know
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.920]   And so they get in the car and they start driving around North Dallas looking for a parakeet
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.520]   Okay, and and and so they're gone and and I'm not there Monica calls me
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.800]   Will you just pray and she tells me you know, Presley's just torn up over it Presley literally prays his prayers
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.440]   Like just tears rolling down her cheeks God
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.120]   I just pray that if you don't let me find turquoise that you would give him a friend to protect him because he's not a
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.120]   survivor and
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.440]   And I'm thinking she's right he's not a survivor we've baby this bird, you know
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.840]   And so they drive around for a long time looking for turquoise and then they eventually give up they come back to the house
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.000]   And I mean when they come near the house Presley sees this like turquoise blur on the horizon
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.520]   I'm talking like four houses over and she says mommy. I saw turquoise and Monica's like, oh, you know, sweetie. It's gonna be okay
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.280]   You know
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.280]   Turquoise is free now, you know
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.980]   And and and press is like no mommy. I saw him
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.600]   I saw him just drive this way and they drive down the alley
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.680]   Behind our house and right on the other side of our fence there in the grass is turquoise
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.620]   He came back
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.360]   He came back
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.360]   Yeah, yeah
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.620]   And I know why he came back. I know why he came back
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.760]   Because turquoise would rather be in captivity
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:25.320]   To a person who loves and cares for him and provides for him than what the others might think of freedom
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.680]   Where he may be devoured
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.000]   And I want you to know here tonight that some people you you have to
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.800]   Understand that if you want freedom real freedom comes from full submission to a master who loves you
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.000]   It's the only place you're gonna find freedom. You're not gonna find freedom anywhere else
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.520]   But to a master to a God who created you and loves you and has a plan and a purpose for your life
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:02.180]   So in your pursuit of freedom you remember about that provider you remember about that protector you remember about that
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.640]   God who loves you and that's why I do this. That's why I'm here tonight
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:12.960]   That's why my wife's gonna tuck my kids in this evening alone because I'm just crazy enough to believe that if the Holy Spirit would speak
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:20.620]   Through us up here and inspire you and capture the hearts of some young adults man. We can change the world and we're watching God
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.840]   Do it right before our eyes. We're seeing him do it. I
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.700]   Will tell you there's nothing revolutionary about birds that fly away
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.360]   But birds that come back
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.800]   And say hey, I belong to a master who loves me and has a plan and a purpose for my life
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.400]   Who's gonna care for me and provide for me and protect me?
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.880]   And so I will fully and willingly submit my life to his care. That's a revolutionary act
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:54.640]   That indeed is revolutionary. And so we're starting a new series this evening called New Year
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.280]   revolution not New Year
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.480]   Resolution because resolutions may change you
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.680]   revolutions change the world resolutions might make a better you for a moment, but
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.200]   Revolutions that's you stepping into the greatest revolution. The world has ever seen
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.360]   revolutions change the world and I will tell you that
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.880]   Revolutions have all started with one thing in common. It is indeed the pursuit of freedom
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.120]   Okay, whether it's the American Revolution that that sought freedom from Britain
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:35.480]   Whether it's the French Revolution that sought freedom from an absolute monarchy or even cultural
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:42.760]   revolutions like the sexual revolution of the 60s that sought freedom that said I want to be able to have sex with whoever I want
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.000]   whenever I
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.160]   want it is indeed the pursuit of freedom and
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.920]   That may be something that we all
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:08:00.040]   desire this evening, but that is the great paradox of the Christian faith that victory comes through free through surrender and freedom through
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.720]   Submission that real freedom comes into stepping
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.520]   Into this revolution and so I will tell you friends
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.520]   That when I
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.040]   Pursued freedom and anything else
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.800]   It has led to a tragic captivity
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.320]   Like when I pursued freedom and sex outside of marriage
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:30.720]   It ultimately landed me in a toxic relationship that I couldn't shake loose. I was stuck in
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.760]   life full of shame and guilt when I pursued freedom in
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.040]   pornography I
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:46.880]   Became a slave to pornography not able to walk away from pornography stuck in pornography when I pursued
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.040]   freedom in the party
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:56.640]   And in in getting drunk then all of a sudden I didn't know how to have fun without it. I was a slave to
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.320]   Alcohol to the drink to the party see sometimes
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:08.160]   The things that we pursue freedom in make us its slave and it's not pretty
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.280]   And no one here is free
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.040]   We're all followers
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.760]   We're all following
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.280]   something
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.280]   either culture or Christ
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.080]   money or the Messiah a
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.840]   Relationship or the righteous one the crowd or the cross right? We're all following
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.400]   something
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.080]   So the way that you join the greatest revolution the world has ever known
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.600]   It's by choosing the right leader following the right leader
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.440]   That's what I want to talk to you for for just the next few minutes. Is that freedom comes from following?
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.560]   freedom
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.480]   Comes from following and if I told you tonight I said hey I can make you free I
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:56.320]   Can set you free? I can I have oh, I have freedom to offer you that may not be that compelling
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.000]   You may be like what JP I walked in I drove here on my own. I walked in on my own. I'm free
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.240]   I don't know what you really mean, but if I start personalizing and I look you in the eyes and I say say
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.840]   Christ offers you freedom from anxiety
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:17.760]   Freedom from the need for approval freedom from the fear of man freedom from the love of money freedom from materialism
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:26.800]   Freedom from the need to be liked freedom from depression freedom from cutting freedom from sadness freedom from loneliness freedom from false hopes
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.280]   Then all of a sudden you might lean in and be like, okay, I want this freedom
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:40.380]   Jesus offers you that freedom right now. It is available to you in a life that is following him
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.900]   and
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.660]   so from John chapter 10
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:51.700]   I'm going to teach where freedom is not found where full life is found and
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.260]   Where forgiveness is found?
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:11:00.380]   Verse 1 very truly I tell you Pharisees Jesus talking to the Pharisees anyone who does not enter the sheep
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.780]   Pin by the gate but climbs out
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:09.020]   By some other way is a thief and a robber the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.860]   And so there's a shepherd there sheep
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.380]   There's a pin
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:19.180]   captivity and then there's one that seeks to destroy the sheep the gatekeeper opens the gate for him and the sheep
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.700]   Listen to his voice
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:26.980]   He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out when he has brought all when he has brought out all his own
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:32.500]   He goes on ahead of them and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. Do you know Christ's voice?
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:38.380]   But they will never follow a stranger. No, they're not gonna fall for futile temptation
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.060]   In fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize the strangers voice
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:49.140]   Jesus used this as a figure of speech it says but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.540]   Therefore Jesus said again very truly
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.700]   I tell you I am the gate for the sheep all who have come before me of thieves and robbers
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.740]   But the sheep have not listened to them. I am the gate whoever enters through me will be saved
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.340]   They will come in and go out and find pasture the thief only
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.060]   comes to steal and kill and destroy
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:16.220]   This metaphor that Jesus is using came alive for me when I stood at the very place where this revolution started
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.860]   I was there in Israel
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.460]   specifically at the place where the nativity is
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:27.500]   Traditionally known to have curd and where Jesus was born of Mary and I'm looking out and I see the Shepherd's field and in the Shepherd's
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:27.700]   field
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.140]   I see a pin a sheep pin and the in the guide begins to explain it to us
[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:39.540]   How how hundreds of sheep would go into that pin and they would belong to several different shepherds and in this Eastern culture
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.700]   Shepherds were so loving to the sheep
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.420]   They were like a part of their family that they could go up and they could call out their sheep by name
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.620]   They could just make a sound their voice was familiar to them and out of the hundreds of sheep
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.940]   They're the 15 sheep that belonged to that shepherd would come out
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.260]   and
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:04.020]   And the shepherd there in the hills in the distance where the predators looked on they wouldn't come near the sheep if the shepherd was
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:09.300]   There sheep there a defenseless animal that's yours in my role. We cannot survive without a shepherd
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.180]   Sheep have no hope without a shepherd
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:18.780]   They are under the care for the shepherd during the day the shepherd would open that gate and let the sheep graze in pasture if it
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.300]   wanted to or sit in the protection of the pin if it preferred and
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:27.620]   At night the shepherd would lay his own body down in that gap
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:32.540]   so that anything that wanted to enter that pin would have to crawl over him as
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:39.180]   He protected the sheep and then there was this truth that I thought was really interesting in Western culture
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:43.020]   Shepherds drive the sheep they get behind them and they push them forward
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.860]   They throw rocks at them and hit them with a rod but in Eastern culture
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:54.620]   They love the sheep and the sheep follow them. They walk in front of the sheep and the sheep follow the shepherd
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.500]   that's the culture that Jesus spoke these words to
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:05.740]   And so my first point this evening as we're talking about who will you follow is that true freedom cannot be found in following?
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.580]   Anything else not anyone else not anything else the thief
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:14.900]   This says comes only to still kill and destroy and so there are people who desire
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:21.780]   To lead you out of right relationship with Jesus things stuff status marketing arms
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:27.860]   hurts habits hang-ups that seek to lead you out of right relationship with Jesus and
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.460]   The way that they do this is they tempt you with things that you desire
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:36.180]   Things that your flesh desires they do not tempt you with things that you don't want
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.580]   They're not dangling Brussels sprouts in front of you saying hey, come here, you know
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.580]   They use a lure
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.580]   The enemy Satan he's real he hates you
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:53.500]   He hates your unborn children. He hates your spouse. He hates the idea of marriage
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.820]   He hates your faith
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.640]   Your relationship with Jesus he hates it
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:05.740]   So he uses a lure to lure you away a lure is like a fishing term
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.780]   There's hundreds of thousands of different fishing lures
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:15.060]   some have bright colors some move in particular ways some make noises some have a scent and
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:22.740]   They lure the fish away so that the fish wants the lure and when it takes the lure then they they take the fish
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.820]   out of where it belongs and
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.260]   the best lures
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:33.040]   Look like the real thing. That's why the enemy uses things that look like counterfeit abundant life
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:38.020]   Things that look like what God would want for you temporary counterfeit pleasures
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:43.440]   That's what Satan puts in front of you to pull you out of right relationship with
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:49.260]   Jesus right culture is not going to lead you into the right revolution
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:55.000]   You may need to die to this dream of being the cool Christian
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.840]   You may not be able to be a cool Christian may have to be a weird Christian
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:07.240]   You might have to dare I say be a stranger and an alien kind of Christian
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.420]   One that doesn't belong to this world kind of Christian
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:18.820]   One that marches in a different direction kind of Christian like don't we see that the enemy uses counterfeit lures like like
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:24.760]   Pornography, can you think of any other kind of greater counterfeit sex? It's sex with a two-dimensional
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:30.860]   Picture a computer screen. It's counterfeit sex outside of marriage. That ain't real sex
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.500]   Or maybe it's just sex
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:41.720]   But it's not the love that God created us to have an experience
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.180]   In fact, it may rob you of that kind of love it may make that
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:52.900]   Farther in the distance for you out of reach loving things that rust
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.560]   Counterfeit
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.240]   And so here's why I tell you all of this is because none of you said
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.380]   2017 I resolved to be a mediocre Christian
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:13.280]   At the end of this year. I hope I'm really lukewarm me and Jesus that we have some kind of relationship
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.800]   Every now and then I'll talk to him
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:24.520]   No, none of you said that but some of you will have that not because you wanted that but because you wanted Jesus and a
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.080]   lot of other things
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:33.160]   Because you wanted Jesus in a relationship Jesus and stuff Jesus and status Jesus and pleasure that that in the temporary
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:38.640]   Sense not the real kind but the counterfeit sense and so you finish this year
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.160]   Having something
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.800]   very
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.640]   unrevolutionary very
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.140]   Mediocre and he has something better for you
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:52.500]   Like let me just take an example because we talk about porn and sex a lot
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.560]   So I'm gonna go with a different one right now. I'm gonna go with alcohol
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.560]   I'm gonna go with a party if you will
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:02.200]   Right, and so we say hey, I want Jesus and I want the party. I
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.920]   Choose them both
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:13.920]   Proverbs 23 verses 29 through 32 says this who has woe who has sorrow who has strife who has
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:20.360]   Complaints who has needless bruises from the bar fight who has bloodshot eyes from the hangover
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.040]   depression
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.040]   Sadness, what did we do last night?
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:32.520]   Those who linger over wine who go to sample bowls of mixed wine where it says bowls of mixed wine think
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.760]   shots of Jaeger think
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.680]   Margarita bowl of wine was like the margarita of the day the mambo taxi or something
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:46.820]   Do not gaze at wine when it's red when it sparkles in the cup when it goes down smoothly in the end
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.820]   It bites you. Do you see the lure?
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.920]   Do not look at that
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.840]   organ of
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.840]   liquor behind the bar
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.200]   and
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.040]   the $60 $120 bar tab
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:04.720]   In the end it bites like a snake and poisons like a viper
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.640]   And after all the pain and the hangover you wake up and it says I love it ends written thousands of years ago
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.960]   Give me another drink like a dog to his vomit
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.960]   Let me return to that which is destroying my life
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:20.540]   And I can't even see it because I'm thinking that's where life is that I would sit at the bar with a friend and say
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.640]   Man one day we're gonna backpack through Europe, bro
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.320]   One day we're gonna do it
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:30.800]   Man one day I've got all these dreams and hopes and let's just talk about I love you, man
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:36.920]   Sin robs you of creativity. You're not gonna backpack through Europe. You're gonna backpack back to the bar
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:42.840]   Back to the club doing the same thing over and over and over and call it life and it's stupid
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.440]   It's not life
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:53.000]   It's cultures revolution
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   I
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.560]   Saying you can't drink
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:06.240]   I'm saying too many of us have drank under this idea that well Jesus drank and the truth is we love
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.560]   The drink more than we love Jesus
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:16.440]   We love the party more than we love Jesus we've been lured away and we don't even know it my buddy was playing volleyball and
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.200]   Public courts and
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:25.200]   There it was him and some some of his community group and this band of brothers comes up
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.680]   they're all wasted like completely gone and and
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.320]   And they say hey you want to play my friends like sure
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:36.560]   I think we can take you guys and they're like swinging and missing the ball and every other words the f-word and and
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.360]   At the end of it all after my friend won
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.140]   because that's what Christians do and and so
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:46.480]   He gathered him up to share the gospel and said yeah
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:52.440]   I go to this church called watermark and one of the guys goes water the other guys. They would see watermark. I
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:58.760]   Go to the ports. I effin love the ports. I'm there every effin Tuesday, and he's not talking about the restaurant
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.280]   And I love that that guy's here man, I
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.480]   Love it
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.760]   But I don't want him to think that he's following Jesus
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:15.120]   And did I just say he's not following Jesus cuz he's drunk and he's cussing. Yeah, that's what I said
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.120]   He's not following Jesus
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:23.000]   Am I saying he's not saving that's between him and God, I don't know God lets him in
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.440]   I don't know where he did with salvation
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:29.400]   I'm saying the brothers not following Jesus and if that's you you don't dare think that you're following Jesus
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:35.120]   You're not following Jesus. You've given your life to some other God you're worshipping some other God
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.600]   That ain't following Jesus
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:44.000]   You're not saying hey Christ take my life make it thine here. I am I want to follow you
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.800]   Back into that cage. No back into the bar back into the club
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:52.520]   Call myself a Christian be cool Christian evangelism in it. Would you not?
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.360]   You're wrapped up in another revolution
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.680]   That's the wrong revolution, bro
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:10.480]   Nothing revolutionary about that the guy sharing the gospel on the volleyball court. That's revolutionary
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.000]   That's countercultural
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.560]   That's crazy
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:24.040]   Man you like oh man another pastor just tell me stop having sex stop getting drunk and maybe we don't know each other. I
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:33.400]   Remember thinking there was life there. I remember going home with strangers waking up with hangovers. I
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:39.920]   Remember having such a problem that it landed me behind bars
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.600]   Hanging with the wrong people that you you think I don't know how to party I I've partied
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.080]   I've just found a better party. I
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.600]   Found a better leader man
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.240]   Jesus he wants you to know him
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   You would hear his voice
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.400]   The times I've heard the Lord speak to me
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.560]   It's been when I've been spending time with God
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.200]   in his word
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.200]   listening extended periods of time
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.880]   And he speaks and he directs me because it's that familiarity
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:20.280]   If you don't have that don't expect to hear God don't expect his voice to be familiar to him
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.920]   You're gonna hear the one that seeks to steal kill and destroy
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:27.440]   He says I've come so that they might have life and
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.880]   Have it to the full I've come so that they may have life and have it to the full
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:40.400]   Freedom is life to the fullest my second point this evening is life to the fullest is found in following Jesus
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.040]   What does a abundant life mean?
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:51.000]   What does that mean like I asked a group of people that today like could you describe the abundant life that Christ came to give
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.680]   You do you understand you have a grip on what it means life to the full. What does that really mean?
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:01.200]   I asked a friend today who was who was has been a Christian since she was little bitty
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:07.880]   Faithfully followed God never a wonder not in high school not in college. And and here's what I asked
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.400]   I said, I want you to convince me that your childhood was better than mine
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:17.560]   And without hesitation, I'll give you a couple sound bites
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:22.380]   She said I laughed more and I laughed harder and I don't have the scars you do
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.560]   I'm like man, you could have said that a little softer. Okay
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:35.320]   Okay, you know I laughed more and I laughed harder and I don't have the scars you do and she's right
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   Abundant life
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:43.240]   Jesus offers life to the full. I wouldn't believe it had I not experienced it. I
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:48.840]   Stumbled into a church hungover. I sat in the back row. It was this church heard the gospel
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.720]   Surrendered my life to Christ, but I was still kind of seeking I was a baby believer and
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.240]   Some guys here invited me to a lake house
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.480]   And I'd been to a lake house. I've been to lake parties, you know, so I'm like man
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.600]   I wonder what Christians do with a lake house, you know, I didn't know what to do
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.960]   I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.840]   I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.560]   I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.680]   I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.080]   I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.480]   I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.480]   I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.480]   I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.480]   I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.480]   I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.480]   I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.480]   I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.480]   I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.480]   I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.480]   I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.480]   I was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.320]   "Hey, let's talk about how we can change the world."
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.140]   I'm like, "Really?
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:44.980]   You think you can change the world?"
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:45.820]   "Yeah, I think we can."
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:46.640]   "Okay, let me tell you how we're doing it."
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.480]   I'm like, "What, dude?
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.320]   Y'all are changing the world?
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.440]   How did I change the world?"
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.480]   It was like real conversations.
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.920]   And I'm like, my heart's racing.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.320]   True story, I got in bed that night at that lake house
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.620]   and I couldn't sleep.
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.840]   My heart was racing so fast
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.520]   from whatever I had just experienced.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.040]   It was just confusing to me.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.560]   And so I got out of bed the next day.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.720]   I had not slept one single wink.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.000]   And I called my best friend back in Dallas.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.640]   And he woke up groggy, hungover from the night before.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.440]   And I'm like, "Bro, we've been missing it.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.240]   These Christians know how to party."
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.120]   He's like, "Really?
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.440]   What'd you do?
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.240]   Were there kegs there?"
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.040]   I'm like, "No, dude, you don't understand.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.280]   It's like a whole 'nother level of party.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.640]   It's like I don't feel guilty.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.360]   I'm not worried about anything.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.680]   I don't feel anxious at all.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.240]   Like I just have this deep, deep sense of peace
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.520]   inside of me.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.120]   And like whatever I did last night,
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.280]   I wanna do again today.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.480]   And it's like readily available to me."
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.240]   Come so that they might have life
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.820]   and have it to the fullest.
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.040]   Man, some of you guys, you get this.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.520]   I see the changes in your life.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.440]   I watch you on Instagram
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.840]   and I just see your lives change, your feed change.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.600]   And like one of our leaders got married this past weekend
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.760]   and it was so cool to see like who was there.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.640]   'Cause like all the bridesmaids and all the groomsmen
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.720]   were people they had met at the porch.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.160]   Their lives had just been radically made over.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.600]   And I'm like, it's just a picture of abundant life.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.480]   One aspect of it.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.800]   That's why we say so often,
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.840]   change your playmates in your playground.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.940]   But it starts with changing who's in charge of your life,
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.960]   who you're following.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.480]   Jesus says, verse 11, "I am the good shepherd.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.400]   The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:47.080]   The hired hand is not the shepherd.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.320]   Does not own the sheep.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.840]   So when he sees the wolf coming,
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.720]   he abandons the sheep and runs away.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.220]   Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.700]   The man runs away because he is a hired hand
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.600]   and cares nothing for the sheep.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.800]   I am the good shepherd.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.160]   I know my sheep and my sheep know me.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.720]   Just as the father knows me and I know the father
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.800]   and I lay down my life for the sheep."
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.600]   He lays his life down for us.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.280]   That's how he forgave us.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.960]   And talking about freedom,
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.740]   true freedom starts with forgiveness.
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.520]   My third and final point is forgiveness
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.760]   is found in following Jesus.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.520]   Some of you need this point really bad.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.360]   You need to know right now,
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.440]   everything you've done, the thing you did last night,
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:42.200]   it can be wiped clean.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.840]   Forgiveness is found in following Jesus.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.040]   Jesus is committed to forgiving you.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.020]   It's a commitment that he signed in blood with his life.
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.520]   He's saying something really key here.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.920]   He's saying, "Hey, someone employed to watch the sheep,
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.620]   they're not gonna die for the sheep.
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.360]   They're not his sheep."
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.500]   Fair weather friends, your drinking buddy,
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:08.280]   dude, cancer hits, trials hit, layoffs hit,
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.680]   those dude are peace out.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.340]   Hey man, good luck with that.
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.520]   I'll pray for you.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.640]   But this one man, he's not going anywhere.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.000]   He's like, "I laid my life down for that sheep.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.920]   I'm gonna be right there with that sheep.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:28.560]   I'm gonna run and find that sheep.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.320]   I love that sheep.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.160]   That's my sheep."
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.600]   We belong to Jesus.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.920]   We belong to him.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.060]   We're his.
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.000]   We belong to him.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.760]   Take a deep breath and say that to yourself.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.900]   We belong to him.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:46.160]   So you remember that when you're questioning his love for you
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.080]   that you belong to him and he loves you and you are his.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.320]   And Romans tells us that nothing can separate
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.280]   neither height nor depth, nor rulers or principalities,
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.840]   nor angels or demons, nothing in all the earth
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.400]   can separate us from the love of God.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.080]   And so you're asking yourself right now,
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.220]   "Well, what if I do JP?
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.180]   What if I said, what if I love that boy more than Jesus?
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.000]   What if I go back to that relationship?
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   What if I tonight go on my computer or back on my phone
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.800]   and I look at those things and you talk about drinking
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.080]   and this weekend, man, it's the bachelor party,
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.840]   you know, and what am I gonna do?
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.480]   What if I wander away?"
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:25.280]   You think you're gonna outrun God, huh?
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.580]   You think you're faster than him?
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:31.220]   You remember Luke 15, what he does
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:34.120]   when one sheep falls in the pit?
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.360]   He leaves the 99 and he goes after him.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:42.480]   He's gonna find you and he's gonna get you.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.860]   He's gonna take you back.
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.040]   That's the truth.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.480]   So you're not gonna outrun his grace.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.580]   It's faster than you.
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.800]   And so does that mean that you should go
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.360]   to the bachelor party just in case
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.440]   you need a prophetic moment?
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.880]   No. (laughs)
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:00.860]   No.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:01.860]   You want me just to not go?
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:02.760]   Yes.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.400]   Yes.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:10.800]   We were in Disneyland.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:16.320]   Over the break, I had an opportunity to camp out there
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.120]   and opportunity to share the gospel with some friends,
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.500]   talk through scriptures with some friends
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.360]   and got to take my family with me
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.900]   and so took my kids to Disneyland.
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.360]   It was really, it was a great time
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:31.360]   and we were there in line,
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:37.000]   kind of walked from a food place to a ride
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.880]   and I turned around and my seven-year-old,
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.080]   it was on her birthday actually,
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.640]   she was turning eight and she wandered off.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.360]   And I didn't, and she's kind of,
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.080]   she's the middle, kind of dramatic one
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.560]   and I thought, oh no, oh no.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.720]   And here's what I didn't do.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.680]   I didn't be like, hey babe, Finley's gone.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.880]   Let's go ahead and ride this ride
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.280]   and then we'll look for her.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.800]   (congregation laughs)
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.280]   No, I mean, we got a fast pass and all that.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.800]   We better, let's go ahead and knock this out
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.280]   and then we'll find, it's a bit,
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.880]   she's got fences and stuff, she's not going anywhere.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.120]   (congregation laughs)
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.800]   Man, let's eat this, let's finish this hot dog.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.920]   Let's go get some, I'm kind of hungry,
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.560]   let's get some food and then we'll find Finley.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.120]   That's not what I did.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.640]   So babe, Finley's gone, let's find her.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.600]   And I looked everywhere.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.280]   I mean, instantly, like looking around,
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.840]   scramble, that kind of, you know, where is Finley?
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.480]   And I knew it wasn't gonna be good when I found her
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.880]   and there she was, like in a crowd full of people.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.760]   (screams)
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.600]   Just screaming like her head off,
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:44.280]   like the hyperventilate, like can't breathe kind of cry
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:47.880]   and I'm like, okay, everybody get back, she's mine.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.640]   (congregation laughs)
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.480]   And she bites.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.240]   (congregation laughs)
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.920]   And I didn't say, how dare you, Finley?
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.940]   What the heck were you thinking?
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.720]   You're gonna wander off from me, huh?
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.320]   Teach you to wander off.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.640]   (congregation laughs)
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.240]   I didn't do that, it's not what a loving dad does.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.920]   I grabbed her and I held her and I rocked her
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.080]   and I patted her.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.740]   I whispered in her ear, I love you, baby girl.
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:18.740]   Hey, I'm never going to leave you nor forsake you.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.040]   If you leave me, I will find you.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.240]   If someone takes you, I will find you.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.720]   I will go Liam Neeson on them so fast.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.560]   (congregation laughs)
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.720]   It's gonna be crazy, like they better know something.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.680]   I will find you and that's what he's saying.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.720]   He's like, don't you get, I laid my life down for you, man.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.520]   You think I'm gonna die for you and then be like,
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.960]   oh, well, they looked at porn again.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.800]   That's it.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:52.120]   She just threw up her food again, we're done.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.560]   Went back to that joker, no, that's it.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.560]   No, he's pursuing you.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.820]   He's looking for you.
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:05.360]   You're like, man, maybe, how do I know he's pursuing me?
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.200]   Can I, man?
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.440]   Consider where you're at right now.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.140]   Like look around you for a minute.
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:16.860]   You're in a church listening to a sermon
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:20.080]   or something like it from the Bible.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.040]   (congregation laughs)
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:22.920]   He's after you.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.320]   I'd stop running.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.080]   I mean, I'd say, hey, I'm gonna follow him.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:33.480]   He's the only one, you think he can't handle you,
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.080]   he's the only one who can handle your sin.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.040]   Don't you get that?
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.320]   Like that's what Jesus does.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.760]   He's really, really good at handling sin.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.000]   In fact, he's the only person that's ever lived
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.260]   that can handle your sin.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.900]   It's his job description.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.820]   He's a savior.
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:54.120]   Like that's what he's really, really, really, really good at
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.880]   is saving people from their sin.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.920]   Like on his business card, it says,
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.700]   I pay for the sins of others so that they don't have to.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.440]   That's what it says, right?
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:06.120]   It's like Jesus Christ, the Messiah, the living God,
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.680]   I pay for people's sins so that they don't have to.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.680]   It's what he does.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   And so in summary, follow Jesus to freedom.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:25.260]   Follow Jesus to life.
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:30.240]   And follow Jesus to forgiveness.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:38.160]   You follow the world to a pit, to a trap,
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.540]   but you have now something,
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.420]   the chance to do something really amazing with your life,
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.040]   really revolutionary with your life.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.780]   You can come into his care and say, I'm here, I'm yours.
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.620]   Will you lead me?
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:52.500]   I'll follow you.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.180]   There's one that's sought to steal, kill,
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.320]   and destroy from me,
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.440]   but I know that you offer me the real thing, Jesus.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:08.260]   There's a famous preacher in London
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.260]   by the name of Charles Spurgeon.
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.500]   And before an Easter message,
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.520]   he was walking the streets of London
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.780]   when he walked upon a young man carrying a birdcage,
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.460]   just kind of rattling it around like this.
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:23.280]   And inside the birdcage were three field birds,
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.380]   three sparrows, and the boy kind of had
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.420]   this sinister, snarly grin on his face.
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:29.980]   And Mr. Spurgeon said, son,
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.940]   what are you gonna do with those birds?
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.100]   And he said, mister, I'm gonna have some fun
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.100]   with these birds.
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:39.640]   I'm gonna tie them up and see if they can fly.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.920]   I'm gonna pull their feathers out.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:47.560]   I'm gonna see how long they can go without food.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:52.180]   And he said, well, then what are you gonna do?
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:55.560]   He said, well, I got a cat.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.040]   I'm gonna feed him to my cat.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:04.000]   And Mr. Spurgeon said, son, how much for those birds?
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.680]   And he said, sir, you don't want these birds.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.520]   They're field birds.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:07.580]   I got them right over there, that tree.
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.020]   I'll get as many as you want.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.980]   He said, how much for those birds?
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.660]   Boy thought he was kidding, kind of smiled,
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.960]   said 10 pounds, a lot of money.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.600]   $500 today.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.480]   He said, done.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.100]   He said, deal.
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.660]   He said, I'll take them.
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:32.500]   That's what Jesus does.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:38.700]   Satan, what are you gonna do with those young adults?
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.660]   These young adults?
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:44.980]   Oh man, I'm gonna have some fun with these young adults, man.
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.540]   I am going to make them jealous of each other,
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:48.700]   envious of each other.
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.060]   I'm gonna make them love money.
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.260]   I'm gonna make them, give them mannequins
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.020]   and then I'm gonna watch them sink to the manna close.
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.260]   I'm gonna make them sell their lives to corporate America
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.100]   and chain themselves to desk.
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.580]   And I'm gonna make them love each other and hate each other
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.300]   and love each other and hate each other.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.960]   And I'm gonna have them come together
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.380]   and do the single most intimate act
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:13.380]   that anybody could think of outside of the designer's will.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.820]   I'm gonna have them get pregnant
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.980]   and then take the life with a child.
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:22.980]   I'm gonna have them give themselves to religious rituals
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:26.020]   that they would show up and read books and sing songs
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.140]   and pretend to love the one true God
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.040]   when really they love themselves.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.420]   I'm gonna fill them with pride
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.820]   and make them think that they're God.
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.420]   I'm gonna have fun with these young adults.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:42.280]   How much for them?
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:47.740]   These young adults, you don't want them.
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:54.200]   They're self-righteous, materialistic, prideful,
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:39:01.860]   perverted, pornographic, anorexic, bulimic.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.900]   They'll turn on you.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.740]   You don't want these young adults.
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.460]   You don't want them.
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.560]   How much for them?
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:16.580]   Your whole life, done.
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:19.860]   It is finished.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.500]   I'll take them.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.580]   I'll set them free.
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:31.780]   Jesus is calling you out of the cage.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.620]   He's calling you to a better life.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.860]   He's calling you to life to the fullest.
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.700]   You will not have it any other way.
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:45.380]   Guys, because you're here tonight,
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:48.660]   you have the chance to be a part of a revolution.
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:51.740]   El Paso, Tulsa Springs, the Woodlands,
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.860]   Fort Worth, Houston, Dallas.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:40:00.220]   You have the chance to be a part of this revolution.
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.620]   It started in, it started today, 2017 years ago.
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:08.220]   Really at creation when God rolled out the world.
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:11.740]   But today, 2017 years ago,
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:13.940]   God became a man in the form of Jesus Christ,
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.820]   lived a perfect life and died for your sins
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:20.780]   and raised from the dead so that you can live forever
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.580]   with him starting right now.
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:27.740]   So we gathered in this room not long ago
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:30.740]   with some leaders of churches
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.340]   and we showed them a video
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.620]   that I wanna show you right now
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:40.620]   to inspire you to be a part of this revolution.
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.420]   Would you watch this?
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:55.180]   It started in darkness
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:41:00.180]   when all hope seemed lost
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:03.220]   and many had deserted their savior
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.500]   when everyone had lost faith in his promises.
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:14.660]   Jesus Christ, savior of the world,
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.780]   God made man, wakes from the dead.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:26.140]   50 days later, the Holy Spirit spreads among the disciples.
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:30.660]   Common men and leaders alike unite behind our risen king.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.740]   The church, the hope of the world is awake.
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:40.140]   Believers face threats and persecution on every front
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:43.980]   but Christ's conversion of one man from Saul to Paul,
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:47.060]   from minister missionary emboldens others
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:50.380]   to defy the Roman world, not with sword
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.820]   but with their love of Christ and one another.
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:57.420]   Among the greatest threats to the flame of the early church
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:00.300]   is a fire that destroys Rome in 70 AD.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:03.740]   Nero blames Christians who are tortured
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.780]   and put to death in mass.
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:10.020]   The fury of persecution continues for the next 300 years
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.900]   yet Christ's bride thrives,
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.380]   defending its creed against heresies
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:16.660]   and caring for the sick and dying during plagues
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:18.380]   that ravaged the Roman empire.
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:24.740]   The cloud of persecution lifts from 300 to 451 AD
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:28.580]   and the church's focus shifts from survival to doctrine.
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:31.740]   In 325, the Nicene Creed declares the truths
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.380]   that we believe in.
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.940]   One God, creator of all things, one Lord, Jesus Christ,
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.820]   the son of God, the essence of the father,
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:44.860]   God from God, light from light.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.700]   The gospel moves everywhere from Scotland to China
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.480]   and Germany to Russia but the light once in jeopardy
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:54.780]   from external forces is now threatened from within.
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.180]   Infighting and theological rifts persist
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.500]   for the next 400 years.
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.980]   Despite the turmoil, monasteries and religious institutions
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.220]   are established.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.860]   Christ's message prevails.
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:09.200]   Believing that all Christians should have access
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.660]   to God's word, John Wycliffe begins work
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:14.800]   on the first handwritten Bible in English.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.620]   The manuscripts face bitter opposition
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:21.620]   but the spread of God's word only accelerates.
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.260]   In the mid 1400s, the printing press is invented
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.320]   by Johannes Gutenberg.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:37.380]   The very first book ever published is the Bible.
[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:41.100]   A century later, Martin Luther nails 95 theses of contention
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.800]   to the church door in Wittenberg, Germany.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.460]   Under the threat of excommunication and death,
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.380]   Martin Luther refuses to recant.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.980]   The ideas he championed, the priesthood of the saints,
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:55.300]   the Bible as our central religious authority
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:59.440]   and salvation by faith in Christ alone.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.600]   This set the Protestant Reformation in motion.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:06.340]   The gospel then moves through both Central and South America.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:09.220]   In North America, the Puritans arrive and churches move
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:11.420]   throughout the 13 colonies.
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:14.340]   But as in Europe, corruption threatens the heart
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.260]   of the American church.
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:19.920]   In 1730, the words of George Whitefield and Jonathan Edwards
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.420]   confront a complacent church, ushering the great awakening
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:26.700]   in pulpits throughout America.
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:30.340]   Throughout the 17 and 1800s, the modern missions movement
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.820]   takes hold and the gospel spreads west
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:36.060]   into American territories.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:40.020]   As the dawn of the 20th century breaks, D.L. Moody and others
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:43.300]   set the goal of the evangelization of the world
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.380]   in this generation.
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.960]   Wycliffe Bible translators labor to bring the Bible
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.740]   to every language group in the world.
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:54.820]   In 1892, a young evangelist, Billy Graham,
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:58.100]   proclaims the gospel to hundreds of thousands of people
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.700]   over an eight week period.
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.580]   He goes on to share the hope of Christ
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:06.100]   with 215 million people worldwide.
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:08.220]   In the heart of the American South,
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.780]   Dr. Martin Luther King confronts segregation
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.820]   and discrimination against African-Americans,
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.380]   inspiring God's people to spark change
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:21.060]   in our shameful history of racism.
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.820]   Martin Luther's revivals, reforms,
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.700]   and resurgences of the faith in the larger context of history
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:33.100]   dots on a timeline leading to this very moment.
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:40.940]   But pause to consider the men behind these moments.
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.220]   Did Martin Luther know the reform
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.700]   that the '95 thesis would ultimately bring?
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:50.460]   Did Moody, Gutenberg, Wycliffe see the generations
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:54.180]   of these men as a sign of the end of their toil?
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.180]   No.
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.940]   These men who responded faithfully to God's call,
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:02.140]   they never knew how God would use their legacy.
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.420]   They couldn't know that hundreds of years later,
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:07.140]   God would use their obedience to make history
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:10.220]   and to inspire a new generation of leaders.
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:14.620]   So I ask you, what are you making of this moment?
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:18.620]   What are you doing to shape the world around you for Christ?
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:22.060]   What are you doing to change the world in the first place?
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.620]   Yet somewhere along the line,
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:26.020]   as the forces of darkness threaten the light,
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:29.300]   we became discouraged.
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.980]   As the controversies and clashes with culture
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:36.060]   threaten the health of the church, we've become weary.
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:39.620]   That's why today we must break the chains
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:42.060]   of complacency and compromise,
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:47.020]   stand firm on the word of God, and renew our faith.
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.940]   We must remind ourselves that Christ's body,
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.060]   it's the hope of the world.
[00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:54.100]   We are not dead.
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.900]   Breathe on us, Lord.
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:58.820]   Now is the time for us to arise.
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:02.220]   Now is the moment where we become awake.
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:12.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
