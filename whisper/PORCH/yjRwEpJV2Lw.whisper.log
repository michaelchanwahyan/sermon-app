[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   [Music]
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   You carried my burdens and hung on that tree
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   With every breath You thought of me
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Without Your mercy where would I be?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Where would I be without You?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   All of my sorrows were met with Your grief
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   In suffering and dying You gave me the keys
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Without Your cross where would I be?
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Where would I be without You?
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Hallelujah, You came to set me free
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Hallelujah, You ran to welcome me
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   The story isn't over, it's only just begun
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   You've written every word in perfect love
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Hallelujah, sing hallelujah
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Sing hallelujah
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   You silenced the curse of my enemies
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   And rose up in power, my King of all kings
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Without Your victory where would I be?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Where would I be without You?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Hallelujah, You came to set me free
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Hallelujah, You ran to welcome me
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   The story isn't over, it's only just begun
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   You've written every word in perfect love
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Hallelujah, sing hallelujah
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Sing hallelujah
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I was an orphan left on the street
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Died of beating, broken and weak
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   You knew my history, all of my sin
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   With open arms You welcomed me in
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I was an orphan left on the street
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Died of beating, broken and weak
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   You knew my history, all of my sin
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   With open arms You welcomed me in
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Hallelujah, You came to set me free
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Hallelujah, You ran to welcome me
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   The story isn't over, it's only just begun
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   You've written every word in perfect love
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Hallelujah, sing hallelujah
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I was an orphan left on the street
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Tattered and beaten, broken and weak
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   You knew my history, all of my sin
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   With open arms You welcomed me in
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Oh, You welcomed me in
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Yes You did Lord
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Cause I was lost and opened
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   But You welcomed me in
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   There's nowhere I could go from this feeling
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   You welcomed me in
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Hallelujah, sing hallelujah
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   [Music]
