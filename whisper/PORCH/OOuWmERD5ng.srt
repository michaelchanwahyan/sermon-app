1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:20,900
 - Good evening everybody, it's so great to see you

3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,960
 and I wanna welcome the part of the people

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,460
 who are not here in Dallas.

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,540
 There's an invisible section of seats

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,240
 that is even bigger than this entire room

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,940
 and it's the people that are in Fort Worth, Houston,

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,320
 El Paso, Tulsa, all over the place,

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,360
 all over the country, all over the world in fact.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,340
 We're so glad that you guys are tuning in with us.

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,880
 If we have not met, my name is Garrett,

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,060
 I serve on the staff team here at The Porch

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,200
 and I'm so excited to get to spend

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,120
 another Tuesday night with you guys.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,040
 It's gonna be great.

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,600
 So I hope it's gonna be great.

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,840
 That was a little overconfident, wasn't it?

18
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,640
 I'm excited and I hope it's gonna be great.

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,320
 Hey, I wanna start by sharing this with you.

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,060
 A couple years ago, my wife and I took our closest friends

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,560
 and family and we went off to Mexico to get married.

22
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,960
 Now we were very excited about that.

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,820
 The destination wedding thing has some advantages

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,300
 for one, the beauty.

25
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,960
 It was fun to get married on a beach.

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,880
 Actually, I think we've got a picture of it here

27
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,380
 and it was quite a sight.

28
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,720
 There's JP all fired up, you know,

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,740
 like there's family on the right, family on the left.

30
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,720
 It's really pretty, but you can't actually see

31
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,400
 like right outside the picture,

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,360
 there are these other resorts to the left and right.

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,200
 So there's this guy like with like an umbrella drink

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,480
 sitting on his like belly, you know,

35
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,040
 like right outside of this picture.

36
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,280
 So we all had this very thin slice of the beach.

37
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,240
 But one of the disadvantages of us getting to go have

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,420
 this awesome experience was that all of our families

39
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,340
 stayed the night at the same place we did

40
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,900
 on our wedding night.

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,780
 We were all at the same place for this resort,

42
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,340
 big mistake, huge, don't do this.

43
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,840
 So anyway, we were all at the same place

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,320
 and in the morning, we knew we were all,

45
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,020
 they were gonna go back home.

46
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,620
 A lot of family in Texas, some in Florida

47
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,540
 and some elsewhere.

48
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,100
 And we were gonna go to the other resort

49
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,180
 for the rest of the honeymoon.

50
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,220
 So all the people that we brought down there

51
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,100
 are great people, family, friends, pastor, you know,

52
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,980
 I mean, it's just all good.

53
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,180
 They all have one thing in common,

54
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,820
 don't wanna see him the day after the wedding.

55
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,400
 So it becomes our like top priority, you know,

56
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,940
 that we wanna get out really early.

57
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,220
 You know, we wanna get out soon.

58
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,780
 So we set this like terrible, like 7.30 a.m.

59
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,060
 pickup from the other resort

60
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,960
 and they're gonna come get us.

61
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,980
 They said, we'll be there, we'll bring the car.

62
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,740
 And so we're out there at 7.30 a.m.

63
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,660
 I mean, just tired, you know, we're up all night

64
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,700
 praying for you guys.

65
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,700
 And so we walk out there and it's like 7.30 a.m.

66
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,100
 And 7.30 kind of comes and goes,

67
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,980
 7.40 kind of comes and goes.

68
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,680
 I'm like, oh no, 7.50 comes and goes.

69
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,880
 And so I went inside the lobby.

70
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,540
 I'm like, people are about to start waking up.

71
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,580
 I don't wanna see anybody.

72
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,420
 So I went in and I said,

73
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,300
 can we call the other resort and see what's going on?

74
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,700
 So they call and they're like, okay, they're sorry.

75
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,060
 They forgot, they're gonna come.

76
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,760
 I said, okay, no worries.

77
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,660
 They're late for the record, but that's okay, no big deal.

78
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,500
 And then I hear this ding and I turn around the elevator

79
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,540
 and her dad is walking out and then mom's walking out

80
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,500
 and then grandma's walking out.

81
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,120
 All the Jamaicans are coming out of the elevator.

82
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,060
 All right, she's Jamaican.

83
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,420
 And so everybody is coming out.

84
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,260
 Her family's there.

85
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,420
 JP starts walking down in the lobby.

86
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,860
 I'm like, oh, this is exactly what

87
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,220
 I did not wanna have happen.

88
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,140
 And I'm like picturing like,

89
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,820
 how's this conversation gonna go?

90
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,140
 You know, like how was last night?

91
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,980
 You know what I mean?

92
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,620
 (audience laughing)

93
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,980
 What do you say?

94
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,460
 And so I have no idea what's about to happen.

95
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,500
 And curve ball, thankfully, they were very gracious.

96
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
 Nobody even messed with us.

97
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,300
 I just knew it was gonna be a like merciless attack

98
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,620
 and nobody messed with us.

99
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,500
 It was totally fine.

100
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,780
 And then the guy finally got there.

101
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,580
 And I just wanna say, we're glad to see you,

102
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,560
 but you're late.

103
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,820
 And what I wanna talk about tonight

104
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,140
 is one of the most normal frustrations

105
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,900
 that we tend to feel toward God in this life

106
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,900
 is you are late.

107
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,260
 You should have been here sooner.

108
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,740
 I needed you a few minutes ago

109
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,660
 or a few years ago, maybe even.

110
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,740
 And you chose not to show up

111
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,420
 'cause I know you could have,

112
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,460
 but you didn't show up for me in the way I needed,

113
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,140
 in the timeframe that I needed,

114
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,380
 in the spot that I needed.

115
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,300
 And this is not just a Christian experience.

116
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,180
 You know, this is a human experience

117
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,240
 for us to feel like, God, you are late.

118
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,340
 Where are you?

119
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,320
 And it can come out in so many different ways.

120
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,460
 Maybe you feel like God might be late

121
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,660
 on getting you a promotion,

122
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,460
 on getting you the job that you deserve.

123
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,580
 You might feel like God is late to help you get in life

124
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,380
 where your age should tell you you should be

125
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,300
 in your own mind.

126
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,920
 You might be feeling like God is late

127
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,280
 to get the person that you're sitting around right now

128
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,860
 to get you out the friend zone

129
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,260
 and ask you on a date.

130
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,860
 You might be feeling like God is late

131
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,820
 to help the person right next to you buy a ring,

132
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,940
 you know, and like actually get this thing

133
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,780
 rolling a little bit.

134
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,020
 Who knows why you think God is late,

135
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,660
 but it normally comes out like this.

136
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,780
 Why doesn't God,

137
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,220
 I just created a lot of conflict for some of you.

138
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,060
 I'm so sorry.

139
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,860
 Couldn't resist.

140
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,680
 I planned that one too.

141
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,520
 I knew that was coming.

142
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,740
 So it usually comes out like this.

143
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,460
 Why doesn't God do something about this?

144
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,540
 You ever thought that?

145
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,940
 Why doesn't God do something about this?

146
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,460
 And it's so easy to come up with a this.

147
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,220
 Some of you are sitting next to this.

148
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,740
 Now it is so easy to come up with,

149
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,900
 why doesn't God do something about this in my life?

150
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,860
 Why is it still this way?

151
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,620
 Maybe late to heal a family member of a sickness,

152
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,720
 maybe even late to bring somebody back to the faith

153
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,580
 from your family who left.

154
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,460
 I have had more than one occasion in my life.

155
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,060
 Again, not just since I became a believer

156
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,300
 and started trying to walk with Christ,

157
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,940
 which wasn't until early adulthood for me.

158
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,860
 But I've had plenty of experiences on both sides

159
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,140
 of that conversion experience

160
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,220
 where I just feel like I'm tapping my foot,

161
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,700
 waiting on God while tragedy enters into my life.

162
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,660
 I know what that is like.

163
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,500
 I know what that feels like.

164
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,340
 And what I wanna talk about tonight is

165
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,940
 what to know when it seems like God is late.

166
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,900
 Some of you might feel it so strongly that you're like,

167
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,980
 buddy, I'm telling you, God doesn't seem late.

168
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,260
 God is late.

169
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,100
 All right.

170
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,200
 And I wanna tell you, wherever you're at right there,

171
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,100
 I wanna tell you that tonight we're gonna see a story

172
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,100
 where Jesus would seem to show up late on purpose

173
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,140
 and have a lot of negative consequences

174
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,740
 for some people that he really loved.

175
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,700
 But thankfully in this story, as Jesus showed up late

176
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,820
 and disappointed a lot of people in a very significant way

177
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,620
 in this story in the scripture that we're about to see,

178
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,940
 he takes time to explain himself, which is really helpful.

179
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,540
 'Cause there were some very confused friends around.

180
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,380
 Jesus, why were you so late as you're about to see?

181
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,460
 And he takes time to explain himself

182
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,940
 what is really going on when it seems that God is late.

183
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,260
 And the narrator of the scripture,

184
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,580
 which this is in the gospel of John chapter 11,

185
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,120
 the narrator of the scripture actually jumps in

186
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,700
 to explain a little bit about what God might be doing

187
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,740
 in the times that relate.

188
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,160
 So we're gonna be in John chapter 11.

189
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,540
 This is an amazing Bible story.

190
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,360
 I just wanna tell you, if you have never heard this story,

191
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,580
 this is going, I can promise on the authority of scripture,

192
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,740
 not on my telling of it, but on the authority of scripture,

193
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,700
 this is an amazing and interesting story.

194
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,620
 I'm excited for us to get to experience it together.

195
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,900
 It's quite an experience.

196
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,840
 So it starts with Jesus, of course,

197
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,180
 and in a relationship with some of his friends.

198
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,260
 So Jesus, of course, is God in the flesh,

199
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,580
 which means he had a human life,

200
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,040
 which means he's a friend to like certain people,

201
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,400
 not just a friend to everybody

202
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,780
 because God's a friend of everybody,

203
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,620
 but Jesus had real human relationships

204
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,340
 because he lived a real human life.

205
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,820
 And some of his friends were named Mary and Martha.

206
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,900
 You might remember him interacting with them

207
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,240
 in other parts of the scripture.

208
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,460
 So Jesus has these friends, Mary and Martha,

209
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,700
 and they have a personal friendship.

210
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,940
 Well, there was a third person named Lazarus

211
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,500
 that isn't mentioned earlier in the story.

212
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,900
 Lazarus is the brother of Mary and Martha

213
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,780
 and a dear, dear friend of Jesus.

214
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,980
 Well, it happens that Lazarus got sick,

215
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,820
 which sets the table for the story.

216
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,580
 When a family member gets sick,

217
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,540
 some of you know what this is like.

218
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,020
 When a family member gets sick,

219
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,200
 it's almost as if you don't even have to reflect back

220
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,980
 and go, well, what faith am I again?

221
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,180
 I mean, you just naturally start to pray to God and go,

222
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,740
 God, please help my family member.

223
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,900
 Please stop this.

224
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,000
 And that is the situation

225
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,260
 that Lazarus and company found themselves in.

226
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,140
 So this is what happens.

227
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,700
 The sisters sent word to Jesus.

228
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,100
 He was only about a day and a half's walk away.

229
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,500
 So the sisters, Mary and Martha, sent word to Jesus,

230
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,500
 Lord, the one you love is sick.

231
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,940
 Now this will show you

232
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,100
 that there is a very familiar relationship here.

233
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,700
 They don't even have to say his name.

234
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,100
 It's not like they're like, Lord, the one you love is sick.

235
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,820
 And he's like, well, I love everybody, I'm God.

236
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,320
 It wasn't like that.

237
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,720
 He knew exactly who they were talking about

238
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,160
 because he had a close personal relationship with Lazarus.

239
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,460
 And so Lazarus has fallen ill

240
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,720
 with a life-threatening sickness.

241
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,700
 We don't know what, that detail's not recorded,

242
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,480
 but Lazarus is completely sick.

243
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,460
 It says when he heard this,

244
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,340
 Jesus said, "This sickness will not end in death."

245
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,820
 And this is where Jesus starts

246
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,820
 to make some really confusing friendship choices.

247
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,340
 Listen to what Jesus says out loud right here.

248
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,480
 "No, it's for God's glory."

249
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,720
 He's sick and dying.

250
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,360
 That's a very Jesus-ese thing to say.

251
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,020
 Like, it's for God's glory.

252
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,340
 We're telling you he's dying.

253
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,820
 Life is for God's glory.

254
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,980
 Death is not for God's glory.

255
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,380
 But he says, "Nope, this is for God's glory,

256
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,620
 "so that God's son may be glorified through it."

257
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,580
 And then it says, "Now Jesus loved Mary and her sister,

258
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,020
 "Martha," or rather,

259
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,060
 "Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus.

260
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,480
 "So when he heard that Lazarus was sick,

261
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,360
 "he stayed where he was two more days."

262
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,500
 He stayed put when he heard that his friend was sick.

263
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,980
 If you were writing this story right here,

264
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,200
 it probably wouldn't say, "Jesus loved Lazarus,

265
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,580
 "therefore he stayed put where he was

266
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,900
 "when he heard about his trouble."

267
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,440
 If we were writing this story, we would say,

268
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,980
 "Therefore, Jesus immediately went right to where he was

269
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,660
 "and did what he'd done for complete strangers."

270
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,860
 But it says, "Jesus chose to stay put,

271
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,880
 "mystifying everybody around him.

272
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,060
 "And then he said to his disciples,

273
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,720
 "now let us go back to Judea,"

274
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,220
 which is the area that they were in.

275
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,460
 And they said, "But Rabbi, a short while ago,

276
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,380
 "the Jews there tried to stone you,

277
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,180
 "and yet are you going back?"

278
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,220
 So here's just kind of some side context.

279
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,220
 Jesus has made himself an enemy

280
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,980
 of the religious establishment,

281
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,340
 and people are trying to actually harm Jesus.

282
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,220
 They're trying, they've got a plot against his life.

283
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,800
 And the disciples kind of lean in and are like,

284
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,000
 "Hey, here's the thing.

285
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,300
 "Some people wanna kill you,

286
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,640
 "and when they throw rocks at you,

287
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,840
 "sometimes they miss and they hit."

288
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,420
 So it would be really great if we don't go back there.

289
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,180
 And Jesus says, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep,

290
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,900
 "but I'm gonna go there and I'm gonna wake him up."

291
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,500
 And then they offer some brilliant medical advice.

292
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,420
 "Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better."

293
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,460
 Which I'm sure Jesus had no idea that that was true.

294
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,540
 Jesus had been speaking of his death,

295
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,300
 but his disciples thought, obviously,

296
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,420
 he meant natural sleep.

297
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,940
 So then he told them plainly,

298
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,100
 and this is where Jesus takes his insensitivity,

299
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,700
 it would seem, to a completely new level.

300
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,260
 "Lazarus is dead."

301
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,940
 See, also, Jesus let him die.

302
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,380
 "Lazarus is dead, and," listen to this,

303
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,060
 "for your sake, I'm glad I wasn't there."

304
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,900
 What?

305
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:51,140
 "So that you may believe, so that you can have faith,

306
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,160
 "so that your trust toward me could be built.

307
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,980
 "But now let us go."

308
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,820
 I mean, let's just admit, if you're there, you're confused.

309
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,260
 Some of you've had this scene in your life

310
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,340
 where you're like, "God, there is a Lazarus in my life,

311
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,780
 "a person or a thing or a dream or an opportunity,

312
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,620
 "and I need you to come and be of assistance."

313
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,860
 And it goes to the ground,

314
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,120
 and then you hear something like this,

315
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
 it's almost just angering.

316
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
 It's like, "For your sake, for my sake,

317
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,920
 "you're glad you weren't there?

318
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,800
 "You were the one we needed.

319
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
 "We needed you.

320
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,760
 "And you're talking about,

321
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,120
 "you're saying this 'cause of my faith?

322
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,260
 "You want this to happen because of my faith?"

323
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,420
 Jesus is sending a really, really clear message

324
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,260
 with this sentence.

325
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,460
 He's saying, "I am letting a medical

326
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,300
 "and a relational tragedy happen on purpose

327
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,540
 "to form faith in you."

328
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,020
 That's what he's saying.

329
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,100
 I mean, if you're there, you're thinking,

330
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,560
 "Look, this is a medical malpractice.

331
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,140
 "If you were a doctor, you would lose your license.

332
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,460
 "Okay, you're breaking your oath.

333
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,900
 "You have to go care for these people,

334
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,300
 "and it's definitely a friendship foul.

335
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,180
 "Oh, this is not good."

336
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,080
 And then he is saying, "I let it happen

337
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,420
 "because there is something that is even more important

338
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,680
 "than the immediate lifting of a terrible disease,

339
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,880
 "and that is that your faith, your connection to God,

340
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,920
 "your belief, your trust toward the Almighty

341
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,960
 "needs to be built."

342
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,240
 So I wanna tell you tonight that having to wait

343
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,740
 does not mean that God is late.

344
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,060
 Jesus is right on time.

345
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,380
 He took his time.

346
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,220
 Now, don't get me wrong.

347
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,240
 He might be late on your priority,

348
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,000
 totally might be late on your priority.

349
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,320
 The thing you want, the thing you need,

350
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,400
 the thing you're asking for,

351
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,320
 he might show up late on purpose

352
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,120
 to the party you're trying to throw,

353
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,040
 but he's not late on his priority.

354
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,520
 He's not late on what he's trying to do in you.

355
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,120
 Sometimes we want God to do things for us.

356
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,560
 God, will you do this for me?

357
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,480
 Will you please show up right on time and do this for me?

358
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,160
 And he might say yes, or he might say,

359
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,840
 "No, I'm not gonna show up and do that thing for you,

360
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,620
 "but I am gonna do something in you."

361
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,960
 And I'm always on time for that one.

362
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,880
 Jesus is telling us that his purpose is to form faith,

363
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,560
 belief, confidence, trust, reliance,

364
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,680
 all means the same thing as a concept in the New Testament.

365
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,160
 He's trying to build the connection and the trust

366
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,560
 between people and God, between people and God.

367
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,600
 That's what he's trying to do.

368
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,080
 And even though our priority

369
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,380
 is usually to fix the immediate,

370
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:21,960
 Jesus has got his eyes set on fixing the ultimate,

371
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,320
 which is our faith and our view of God.

372
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,960
 When am I gonna get married?

373
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,800
 I don't know.

374
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,960
 I know he's not late and he's forming faith in you.

375
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,080
 When am I gonna get to go on a date?

376
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,660
 Heck with marriage, a date, it'd be amazing.

377
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,220
 All right, just a date, you know,

378
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,420
 two human beings, eye contact, free dinner, date.

379
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,600
 You know what I mean?

380
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
 Let's make it happen.

381
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
 When do I get that?

382
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,320
 I don't know, I don't know.

383
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,760
 I just know God is forming faith in you.

384
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,460
 That is so obvious from the text.

385
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,000
 God is forming something in you

386
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,880
 and he prioritizes what he's doing in you

387
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,040
 over what you might want him to do for you.

388
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,960
 Let me tell you a sad story from a joyful angle.

389
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,740
 The sickness thing, yeah, that's gonna happen.

390
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,520
 So the sickness thing is real for me.

391
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,360
 So my mom passed away when she was 41, I was 19.

392
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,200
 She was a young mom.

393
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,120
 She got cancer at 39 and 18 months later,

394
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,100
 there was a battle that was about a year and a half long.

395
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,880
 And about a year and a half later,

396
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,420
 filled with by the way, Jesus, the one you love is sick.

397
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,000
 Jesus, the one you love is sick, please help.

398
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,980
 And Jesus stayed where he was for 18 more months

399
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,500
 is what happened.

400
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,220
 And it was as tragic as you can imagine.

401
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,260
 But something happened because God chose to do it

402
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:41,260
 in exactly that way that led to some faith being formed.

403
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,060
 So what happened was, as soon as we got this diagnosis,

404
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,460
 it was horrific, it was terrible.

405
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,860
 It was frightening, it was awful.

406
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,380
 It was everything you can imagine it would be

407
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,980
 and some of you have actually walked this road.

408
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,780
 And so what happened was, our attention immediately turned

409
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,260
 to the ultimate things in life.

410
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,060
 I grew up in a family, my mom took me to church

411
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,340
 on Christmas and Easter, and I think any other time,

412
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,180
 she felt guilty and wanted to take us to church.

413
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,540
 I mean, we didn't go to church a lot.

414
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,860
 It wasn't part of our thing.

415
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,980
 And she was a great parent, a great mom,

416
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,380
 and we had a great relationship.

417
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,660
 But we didn't have faith first in our home.

418
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,820
 Does that make sense?

419
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,460
 And so what happened was, whenever the diagnosis came in,

420
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,340
 all of a sudden we had time to think, to talk

421
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,560
 about the ultimate, about God, about Jesus,

422
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,500
 about what he might be trying to do in us

423
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,260
 through this terrible situation.

424
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,180
 All of a sudden, my relationship with my mom

425
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,780
 got to go to a new depth 'cause I didn't grow up

426
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,220
 in a family where we really got to connect

427
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,060
 about such things.

428
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,860
 We started to pray for one another.

429
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,140
 And in fact, before she died, she left me a note

430
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,540
 to open on my next birthday.

431
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,820
 You wanna talk about high drama, okay?

432
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,500
 I mean, she wrote me a note and she said,

433
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,180
 "Hey, open this on your 20th birthday,"

434
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,420
 which she never lived to see.

435
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,060
 And I opened it on my 20th birthday,

436
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,760
 and it says, always, it's full of like,

437
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,620
 scriptural encouragement, you know?

438
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,440
 "Keep your faith and trust in the Lord."

439
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,440
 Things like that, that never had ever come out of her mouth.

440
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,660
 And think about this.

441
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,660
 Cancer's terrible.

442
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,540
 We're in agreement on that.

443
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,640
 I don't have to prove that to you.

444
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,480
 Like, you know.

445
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,780
 But if it had been a car wreck or even no death at all,

446
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,160
 I don't know where my faith would be today.

447
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,980
 That was the season, that was the thing,

448
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,900
 that was the time that God put his claim

449
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,460
 on my life and on my heart.

450
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,500
 That was the fork in the road

451
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,420
 where I knew I was gonna be all in with God

452
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,500
 or all out with God.

453
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,540
 And by God's grace, he took me to a place of belief

454
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,720
 through the tragedy, and my mom, too.

455
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,840
 We lost one, but God's kingdom got two.

456
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,300
 Come on, do you see that?

457
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,460
 That's what God can do

458
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,440
 when he's trying to form faith in you.

459
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,400
 It might be tragic,

460
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,460
 but he is working something good in you if you can see it.

461
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,500
 It might take time, but it is there.

462
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
 This is his pattern.

463
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,720
 So Jesus decides now he's gonna go

464
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,180
 once he's let the tragedy happen.

465
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,120
 And he gets there, and on his arrival,

466
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,500
 Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb

467
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
 for four days.

468
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,380
 Four days is a long, long time.

469
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,620
 Four days is enough time for several cycles of grief

470
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,020
 and sadness and peace to kinda come and go,

471
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,820
 and you get to sleep a little bit

472
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,980
 and get to relax a little bit,

473
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,960
 and four days is a long, long time of waiting.

474
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,900
 But he comes.

475
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,540
 When Martha heard that Jesus was coming,

476
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,260
 she went out to meet him.

477
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,660
 And this is not like, oh, I'm so glad you finally made it.

478
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,060
 This is like a meeting, like, okay,

479
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,920
 we're gonna talk about the fact that you were late,

480
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,860
 but Mary stayed home.

481
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,740
 These are the two sisters,

482
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,900
 and we get two different reactions.

483
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,580
 It's almost as if Martha's like really angry

484
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,420
 and Mary is just despondent.

485
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,180
 And Martha comes up to Jesus and says,

486
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,960
 Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

487
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,320
 Which is a fact.

488
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,360
 That part's true.

489
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,000
 But I know now that even now,

490
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,220
 God will give you whatever you ask.

491
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,160
 And Jesus said to her, your brother will rise again.

492
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,280
 And now listen to this.

493
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,140
 She says, I know he'll rise again in the resurrection

494
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,220
 at the last day.

495
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,120
 She doesn't believe in the power of Jesus

496
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,400
 in this particular moment.

497
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,280
 Does that make sense?

498
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,960
 I mean, Jesus walks right up to her and says,

499
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,320
 your brother is going to rise again.

500
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,080
 And she goes, yeah, yeah, I know, in heaven.

501
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,200
 I'll see him in heaven.

502
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,280
 And she has no idea what's about to take place

503
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,120
 in this story.

504
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,600
 And Jesus said to her and leaned in,

505
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,760
 and you just imagine the eye contact between these people,

506
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,880
 between the son of God, fully powerful,

507
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,720
 able to do anything, and this broken, angry woman

508
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,160
 who has just incurred a pretty terrible loss.

509
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,640
 And Jesus makes eye contact with her and says,

510
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,040
 I am the resurrection that you just talked about.

511
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,000
 It's not just an event in the future.

512
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,480
 I'm it.

513
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,120
 I am what brings dead things back to life.

514
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,080
 And the one who believes in me will live forever,

515
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,160
 even though they die.

516
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,000
 And whoever lives by faith, by believing in me,

517
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,140
 will never die.

518
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,160
 Do you believe this?

519
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,400
 You hear him building faith again,

520
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,280
 you hear him focusing on that priority again.

521
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,360
 Do you believe this?

522
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,320
 And then she kind of gives another little vague thing,

523
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,440
 yes, Lord, I believe that you're the son of God

524
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,960
 who's coming to the world.

525
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,280
 She's trying to say faith things.

526
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,360
 You ever found yourself in a tragedy or a hard time

527
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,620
 trying to say the right thing,

528
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,280
 but you're not really feeling it?

529
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,200
 I'm convinced that that's what she's doing right here.

530
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,600
 He's looking at her like, do you believe?

531
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,280
 And she's like, yes, in heaven.

532
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,320
 No, but do you believe?

533
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,680
 She's like, yeah, I know you're the son of God.

534
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,960
 That's not what he's asking.

535
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
 There are some of you that this very night,

536
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,840
 you believe that Jesus is the son of God,

537
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,720
 but you don't know that he can do anything for you today.

538
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,280
 And he can.

539
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,980
 He can do something for you today.

540
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,600
 And then Mary comes to the place where Jesus was

541
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,240
 and saw him and she fell at his feet

542
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,160
 and said the very same thing.

543
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,800
 Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

544
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,900
 Now here's the sad sister after the mad sister,

545
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,740
 same comment.

546
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,840
 And when Jesus saw her weeping

547
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,180
 and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping,

548
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,800
 he was deeply moved in his spirit and he was troubled.

549
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,160
 This is where you get to learn something

550
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,520
 about the heart of God in the middle of a tragedy.

551
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,240
 This is where we can see,

552
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,080
 I'm so glad this part is included

553
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,400
 so we can see the heart of God

554
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,560
 when we're up against something horrible and God is late.

555
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,680
 He's moved in his spirit, he's troubled.

556
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,200
 Where have you laid him?

557
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,440
 He asked and they said, come and see.

558
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,300
 And then it says the shortest verse in the whole Bible,

559
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,040
 Jesus wept.

560
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:39,260
 Jesus, the all powerful, mighty Jesus

561
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,300
 who could have stopped it and could have been there

562
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,600
 and already had healed so many people,

563
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:50,480
 stepped down into the dirt that he had made and cried.

564
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,380
 The same tears that everyone else was crying.

565
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,620
 He is emotionally moved by the people

566
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,980
 who have been emotionally moved.

567
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,760
 He's emotionally moved and distraught

568
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,820
 by what is terrible in the world.

569
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,880
 He is hurt by what hurts people.

570
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,780
 And that perfectly reflects the heart of God.

571
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,220
 And this is so crucial to know that

572
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,220
 when something terrible is happening,

573
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,140
 it is not because, and when God chooses to be late

574
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,860
 and it seems like he could have stopped it,

575
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,780
 it's not because he is emotionally detached.

576
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,120
 He gets there and he weeps.

577
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,400
 And you need to know that that's true of your situation.

578
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,760
 If you have a situation that is weep worthy,

579
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,600
 Jesus joins you in that.

580
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,600
 It means that God's delaying is never God detaching.

581
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,840
 God delaying is never God detaching.

582
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,000
 If God, what does that mean?

583
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,720
 It means if God chooses to take his time in your life

584
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,240
 and something doesn't go the right way

585
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,400
 and that you end up hurt

586
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,000
 and you end up in a terrible situation

587
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,440
 and it's just broken, broken,

588
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,320
 and it seems like he's the one to blame,

589
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,940
 he is not emotionally detached.

590
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,560
 This has the power to lift such heavy burdens.

591
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,680
 So we think about the worst parts of your life,

592
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,040
 the parts where you needed him, man.

593
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,360
 I mean, the times when he needed to show up

594
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,340
 and he just didn't and something broke

595
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,560
 and something hit the fan and a marriage ended

596
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,040
 or a relationship ended or your health ended

597
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,280
 or your money ended and something just ended and it was off.

598
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,240
 You need to know that his emotional closeness

599
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,800
 to the situation is fully felt.

600
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,440
 Where was he when I got lied to?

601
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,960
 Where was he when I got fired and I was so upset?

602
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,580
 Answer, he was upset.

603
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,600
 Where was God?

604
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,140
 Where was God when I got assaulted and wept?

605
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,960
 He was weeping.

606
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,080
 That's where he was.

607
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,920
 He walks with us through these things.

608
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,480
 Where was he when you got hurt?

609
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,660
 Answer, he was hurt.

610
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:57,280
 Where was he whenever you were broken?

611
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,580
 He was broken, not his strength, but his heart.

612
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,760
 Broken for whatever you went through.

613
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,900
 I don't know how long your list of hurts is in this life.

614
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,860
 I don't know if it's longer than the person's next to you.

615
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,240
 I don't know if it's longer than the brothers or sisters

616
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,080
 you grew up with.

617
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,920
 I don't know if it's longer than mine.

618
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,980
 However long your list of hurts is in this life,

619
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,460
 even if they're self-caused, it breaks God's heart

620
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,720
 that you have been through a situation

621
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,340
 that caused tears to come out of your face.

622
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,280
 So much so that he chose to do the very same thing,

623
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,620
 even though he knew he could have fixed it.

624
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,660
 He chose to engage in it.

625
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,760
 This is so powerful.

626
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,020
 You know, I don't know that most people don't care

627
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,440
 about God as much as they make it seem.

628
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,700
 You ever run into people and it just seems

629
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,980
 like they don't care about God?

630
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,820
 I'm convinced that they think God doesn't care about them

631
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,940
 and it informs so much of what they do.

632
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,000
 God cares.

633
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,260
 He knows and he cares.

634
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:57,540
 And some of the Jews rightly said, "See how he loved him."

635
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,880
 But some of them said, "Could not he have opened

636
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,920
 the eyes of the blind, have kept this man from dying?"

637
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,640
 You know, you can stay mad at God as long as you want, right?

638
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,240
 You can stay mad at God as long as you want.

639
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,640
 Some of them say, "Couldn't he have stopped this?"

640
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,680
 I mean, some people see his heart, his broken heart

641
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,920
 and the heart of God reaching out to people who are hurting

642
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,120
 and they go, "Oh, at least he loves us."

643
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,020
 And other people go, "Oh, he could have stopped it."

644
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,400
 This is the fork in the road

645
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,520
 that will influence you for years.

646
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,920
 If you wanna stay mad about whatever bad happened to you,

647
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,140
 and I promise you, if you told me what bad

648
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,500
 had happened to you, I wouldn't brush it off.

649
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,580
 I might weep with you because whatever bad happened to you,

650
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,820
 I believe that it was bad and I don't need to disprove that.

651
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,340
 And God's not saying it's not bad.

652
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,620
 But if you choose to stay mad and upset,

653
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,440
 he could have stopped it.

654
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,680
 If you wanna get stuck on that one little piece of reality,

655
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,900
 he could have stopped it, you're gonna go into despair

656
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,020
 for years and years and years.

657
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,780
 But you see how quickly some people can see,

658
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,280
 oh, he loves us and that makes all the difference.

659
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,120
 That's gonna influence where I go next in my heart.

660
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,220
 Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb.

661
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,400
 And this is where the story

662
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,040
 just comes to a complete pinnacle.

663
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,120
 It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.

664
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,000
 I mean, you can feel the drama is kind of waking up here.

665
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,380
 You know, it's like painting the picture.

666
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,840
 It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.

667
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,780
 And Jesus points a finger and says, "Take away the stone."

668
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,660
 And then Martha said, "But Lord," the sister of the dead man,

669
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,520
 "by this time, there's a bad odor

670
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,200
 "'cause he's been in there four days."

671
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,400
 I think this is her getting a little last jab in there.

672
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,520
 You know, he's been in there four days,

673
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,040
 took you four days, you know.

674
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,060
 You've been a long time getting here

675
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,920
 and it's gonna smell bad 'cause you know what happens

676
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,760
 when a dead person dies?

677
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,220
 It starts to stink, especially after four days.

678
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,080
 I think she's getting a little jab in there.

679
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,740
 And this is why I love Jesus.

680
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,200
 He's fully God and he's fully man.

681
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,640
 I think he gives a little jab back.

682
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,720
 Didn't I tell you that if you believe,

683
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,080
 you'd see the glory of God?

684
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,660
 (congregation laughing)

685
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,060
 So they took away the stone.

686
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,100
 And Jesus looked up and said,

687
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,380
 "I love this little meeting with God

688
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,140
 "in the midst of all the human confusion."

689
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,840
 'Cause haven't you noticed everybody's confused?

690
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,580
 Tragedy always does that.

691
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,420
 Everybody's confused.

692
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,900
 Some people are hurt.

693
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,800
 Some people are angry.

694
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,020
 Some people are like, "He could have stopped it."

695
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,460
 Some people are like, "Oh, he loved him."

696
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,360
 I mean, it's just chaos, all right?

697
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,660
 People are repeating conversations.

698
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,800
 If you'd been here, you could have stopped it.

699
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,640
 If you'd been here, you could have stopped it.

700
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,980
 And Jesus goes off in the corner

701
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,200
 and has this little moment with God,

702
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,220
 which I think is so fun.

703
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,340
 He says, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me."

704
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,180
 It's almost as if he's saying,

705
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,020
 "Well, no one down here has."

706
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,020
 We've got every reaction except faith.

707
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,580
 He says, "I know that you always hear me."

708
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,420
 Listen to this confidence.

709
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,800
 It's so obvious to him.

710
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,960
 He's like, "I know you always hear me,

711
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,980
 "but I say this for the benefit

712
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,180
 "of the people standing here."

713
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,020
 Why?

714
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,420
 "So that they may believe."

715
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,300
 That's what I'm after.

716
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,580
 Start to finish.

717
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,660
 He just like wanders off and he just says,

718
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,080
 "God, I know you always hear me.

719
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,420
 "They have no idea, but I'm saying this

720
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,680
 "so that they can believe when this is done.

721
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,700
 "This is for them, the whole thing,

722
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,660
 "the tragedy, the waiting, the anger,

723
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,780
 "and what is about to happen next is for their faith."

724
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,860
 And so when he had said this,

725
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,940
 Jesus called out in a loud voice

726
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,320
 'cause dead people don't hear very well.

727
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,180
 "Lazarus, come out."

728
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,060
 This is an awkward moment at a funeral if there's any pause.

729
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,660
 I don't know how long.

730
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,980
 I don't know how long the pause is,

731
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,820
 but if it's long, I mean, it's awkward.

732
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,060
 You ever been in a funeral where

733
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,200
 some people are kind of stoic

734
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,140
 and some people are like, they're on the casket

735
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,420
 and they're like, "Come back."

736
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:33,260
 I mean, if he is like, he says, "Come forth."

737
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,900
 I mean, he's kind of betting the farm right here.

738
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,420
 I mean, 'cause if it doesn't happen,

739
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,540
 he's gonna lose his following.

740
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,260
 I mean, this is all over and his friends.

741
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,580
 But he says, "Lazarus, come out."

742
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,620
 And it says, "The dead man came out."

743
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,620
 Can you imagine this scene?

744
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,300
 I think sometimes we read this and we forget

745
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,660
 it's not a fairy tale.

746
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,180
 This happened, this really happened.

747
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,780
 Like if you could get in a time machine and an airplane,

748
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,500
 you could have seen this.

749
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,780
 Like if you'd had an iPhone,

750
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,740
 you could have like captured it in slow-mo

751
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,100
 and watched it later.

752
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,020
 Like this really happened.

753
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,300
 "The dead man came out."

754
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,920
 And Jesus looked over at Martha and was like,

755
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,480
 "Four days, nothing."

756
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,320
 I'm just kidding.

757
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,620
 (congregation laughing)

758
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,900
 "The dead man came out.

759
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,360
 "His hands and feet were wrapped with strips of linen

760
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,620
 "and a cloth around his face."

761
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,860
 When Jesus brings you back to life,

762
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,400
 sometimes you still stink for a while,

763
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,180
 but he said, "Take off the grave clothes and let him go."

764
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,580
 And Lazarus came back to life.

765
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,860
 And with this miracle,

766
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,260
 there's so much that we could learn from this,

767
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,580
 but I just want us to see one thing really clearly.

768
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,420
 With this choice, Jesus said yes

769
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,780
 to what he had previously said no to.

770
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,420
 It was no, no, no.

771
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,660
 Day two, no.

772
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,980
 Day three, no.

773
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,280
 Right now, no.

774
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,000
 And then it was yes.

775
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,840
 And by the way, this story happened

776
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,480
 so that you could know that this is God's pattern

777
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,160
 for all of us.

778
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
 Not that he would give us

779
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,840
 whatever little preferences we have on earth,

780
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,560
 but so that we would know that there's a world coming

781
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,480
 where every real and godly desire we have

782
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,440
 will be fulfilled in the kingdom of heaven.

783
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,660
 That in heaven, it will be the place

784
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,520
 where no relationships end because of conflict.

785
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,000
 Heaven will be the place

786
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,400
 where nobody sees tragedy happen ever again.

787
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,800
 It says he'll wipe away every tear from their eyes.

788
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,960
 In other words, every time he was laid and said no

789
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,920
 for a reason to form faith in you,

790
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,760
 faith won't be required one day

791
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,680
 because it is gonna be all right.

792
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,080
 It is gonna be all smiles.

793
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,200
 There's gonna be a place

794
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,600
 where you don't have to worry about people breaking in.

795
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,580
 There's gonna be a place

796
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,420
 where you don't have to worry

797
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,680
 about someone assaulting your kid.

798
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,240
 There will be a place where you don't have to worry

799
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,280
 if the person you love is actually lying to you.

800
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,640
 There'll be a place where the gap between you

801
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,500
 and God is gone.

802
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,800
 And every desire for happiness you've ever had

803
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,860
 is fulfilled and then some.

804
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,040
 And there, your capacity for enjoyment,

805
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,960
 think about this,

806
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,160
 whatever your capacity is,

807
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,320
 like a cup, you know, has a certain capacity.

808
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,160
 Whatever your capacity for wanting and fulfillment is,

809
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,280
 it will be overflowed

810
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,880
 and it will increase and overflow again

811
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,360
 and increase and overflow again.

812
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,620
 And everything that Jesus ever told you,

813
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,120
 no, wait a little longer on,

814
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,320
 it will become a yes.

815
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,180
 Security, you wanna live in a secure environment?

816
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,320
 That's coming.

817
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,640
 You wanna live in a committed environment?

818
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,800
 That's coming.

819
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,220
 You wanna live in unhindered fellowship

820
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,160
 and get some peace finally?

821
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,260
 That's all on its way.

822
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:40,000
 Jesus didn't do this story with Lazarus, by the way,

823
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,760
 to tell us that nothing bad was ever gonna happen again.

824
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,320
 It gets worse before it gets better.

825
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,000
 I don't know if you've seen the death statistics,

826
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,840
 but they're still 100%.

827
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,640
 Lazarus died again.

828
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,000
 Everybody dies.

829
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,920
 Like there's still hardship in life.

830
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,200
 There's still things that are gonna go wrong.

831
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,840
 And there are gonna be times between here

832
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,140
 and the finish line of whatever your earthly life holds,

833
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,480
 where you were thinking,

834
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,280
 God, why are you still saying no?

835
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,400
 Why are you still saying no?

836
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,440
 Why am I still waiting?

837
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,140
 Why is that still not gone my way?

838
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,480
 And eventually, there will be a world

839
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,240
 where you don't want anything

840
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,280
 because you already have it in God.

841
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,140
 And some of you, that news is so good,

842
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,240
 you don't even believe it.

843
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,400
 The scripture says, how will he not also with Christ

844
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,500
 graciously give us all things?

845
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,600
 In heaven, you'll have everything you want.

846
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,760
 In heaven, you'll have everything you want.

847
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,680
 So no right now is not no forever.

848
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,520
 You need to know this.

849
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,880
 If God is late on something you want,

850
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,080
 if God's tardy on something you want,

851
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,840
 you just need to know that no right now is not no forever.

852
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
 It never is.

853
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,040
 Now look, if you're like,

854
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,220
 okay, my Lamborghini's coming one day,

855
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,120
 that is not what I'm talking about.

856
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,560
 Wrong church, that's not what I'm teaching up here.

857
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,720
 I'm not telling you that one day, if you just hold on,

858
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,280
 that 50,000 check is coming in the mail.

859
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,560
 Listen, maybe, I don't know what he's gonna do.

860
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,120
 I have no idea what he's gonna do.

861
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,080
 I'm talking about your legitimate God-given wants.

862
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,360
 I'm not talking about your selfish, preferential,

863
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,600
 self-glorifying wants that we all struggle with,

864
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,440
 including me.

865
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,280
 I'm talking about the good ones,

866
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,780
 the godly ones, the holy ones.

867
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,840
 He's gonna say yes to them in heaven.

868
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,920
 Tim Keller said it this way.

869
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,400
 It's very helpful.

870
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,200
 God will either give us what we ask for

871
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,040
 or give us what we would have asked for

872
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,520
 if we knew everything he knew.

873
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,620
 I wanna close here.

874
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,020
 When I was 26 years old,

875
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,100
 another tragedy happened in my life.

876
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,580
 I wanna share with you about it.

877
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,260
 I wanna share the hope in Christ that was brought to me,

878
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,460
 and then we'll finish our time.

879
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,620
 I've actually shared this story here before.

880
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,660
 You may be familiar with it,

881
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,780
 but whenever I was 26, I got a call

882
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,660
 that my older brother had died in a four-wheeler crash.

883
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,540
 I was actually in church at Watermark Fort Worth.

884
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,460
 It was a Sunday morning, and a little background.

885
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,620
 My older brother lived in a lot of sadness.

886
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:11,060
 He was an alcoholic, self-professed.

887
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,540
 He was a substance abuser,

888
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,860
 and I'd share the gospel with him a lot

889
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,300
 because God had changed my life.

890
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,100
 I was trying to tell him, I'm Lazarus.

891
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,980
 I'm telling you, I was bad.

892
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,660
 Everything you do, I did.

893
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,860
 You haven't done anything I didn't do,

894
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,420
 and I'm telling you, Jesus brought me out of the grave,

895
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,700
 and he can do the same thing for you.

896
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,320
 I sent that message to him pretty consistently.

897
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,300
 One day, I heard that he had lost his life

898
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,420
 in a four-wheeler crash.

899
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,500
 Honestly, I didn't know in that moment if it was on purpose,

900
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,740
 if he wanted to injure himself.

901
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,540
 I know he raged against the world and God

902
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,820
 and pretty much everyone in it,

903
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,180
 and I didn't know if it was an accident.

904
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,020
 I had no answers.

905
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,900
 I just know that one morning, I got up to go to church,

906
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,700
 and four hours later, I was in a sheriff's station

907
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,060
 signing a fatality report, and I walked out

908
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,660
 with his flip-flops and cigarettes in a Ziploc bag.

909
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,500
 That was it.

910
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,760
 Now look, I don't know if that's harder

911
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,140
 than anything you've ever gone through,

912
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,340
 or if for you, that's just the tip of the iceberg

913
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,820
 and there is way, way, way more that you've gone through.

914
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,580
 I don't know, but I do know this happened.

915
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,640
 A few days later, I was just at rock bottom.

916
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,560
 I was in his driveway alone, parked in my car,

917
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,020
 a house where no one lives anymore,

918
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,820
 out in the middle of nowhere, and I'm parked there,

919
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,660
 and you know what I was saying?

920
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,420
 God, you could've stopped it.

921
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,260
 You could've stopped it.

922
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,220
 I was just stuck.

923
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,420
 God, you could've stopped it.

924
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,900
 I was so stuck in that thought,

925
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,900
 like God, why'd you stop it for me?

926
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,260
 My life was deteriorating in sin and sadness and shame

927
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,980
 and insecurity and self-doubt and anger,

928
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,420
 and I was on the same track,

929
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,780
 and you just stepped in and changed everything.

930
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,240
 You could've done that here.

931
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,480
 I was literally saying, Lord, if you had been here,

932
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,020
 my brother would not have died.

933
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,060
 And I was just stuck on that, and I was struggling.

934
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,460
 I was supposed to get up and preach the funeral

935
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,260
 like two days later, and I'd had no hope,

936
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,420
 and a friend called me on the phone,

937
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,860
 and it was a dear friend who was on staff with me.

938
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,940
 He was kind of a mentor-type figure,

939
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,980
 a few years older than me, and he called me,

940
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,100
 and he said, Garrett, I heard about the tragedy,

941
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,460
 and he started to say that.

942
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,000
 He could tell I was just like crying, man.

943
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,260
 I'm just like having it out with God.

944
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,500
 I don't cry a ton, and this was just all in.

945
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,980
 And he said, where are you?

946
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,420
 He could tell it was more of an emergency-type moment.

947
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,420
 He said, where are you right now?

948
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,560
 I said, I'm in his driveway,

949
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,860
 and I just can't stop thinking God could've stopped this,

950
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,760
 and he was late.

951
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,940
 And he said, Garrett, he said words

952
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,860
 that I will never forget because I didn't just see 'em

953
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,540
 in John 11, but because I heard 'em come out

954
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,300
 of my friend's mouth, and I knew they were true.

955
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,860
 He said, it's true that God could've stopped it,

956
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:45,420
 but we both know that doesn't mean that God doesn't care,

957
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,300
 and it doesn't mean God wasn't doing more than you can see.

958
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,740
 And that might be all we get,

959
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,820
 but it's enough to trust him fully.

960
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,780
 And that little piece of counsel led me out

961
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,540
 of what could've been the end of me and God.

962
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,760
 Like, if I'm being honest, all I gotta do is stay stuck on,

963
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,100
 God, you could've stopped it, and you were late.

964
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,140
 All I gotta do is commit to that mindset.

965
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,260
 And I might've just gone away from God forever.

966
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,820
 I don't know.

967
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,300
 But by God's grace, he sent a friend

968
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,580
 to deliver the same message to me that we just encountered

969
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,940
 that Jesus delivered personally, and that's this.

970
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,340
 If you're going through tragedy, and God was late,

971
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,620
 it's not 'cause he's emotionally detached,

972
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,560
 and it's not because he's gonna hold out on you forever,

973
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,860
 but you can bet it is to do the same thing for you

974
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,900
 that Jesus was aiming to do

975
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,220
 for the people who witnessed this live,

976
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,580
 and that is to form faith in you while you wait.

977
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,180
 Let me pray for us.

978
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:49,320
 God, we have more questions than answers

979
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,540
 when it comes to our tragedies,

980
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,900
 when it comes to our low points,

981
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,760
 when it comes to the why,

982
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,580
 when it comes to the hurts, and the lonely questions.

983
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,700
 We confess, God, that we don't have every answer we want,

984
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,260
 but we do have the answers that we need.

985
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,140
 We don't know everything we wanna know

986
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,220
 about the tragedy that happened in our lives.

987
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,020
 I don't have all of my questions answered, God,

988
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,780
 and I know that these friends do not either,

989
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,780
 but we do have some questions answered.

990
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,600
 Do you care?

991
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,740
 We know the answer is yes.

992
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,300
 Do we have hope?

993
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,120
 We know the answer is yes,

994
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,860
 because a few chapters after what we just encountered,

995
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,320
 you went to the grave yourself and came back again

996
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,700
 so that we could know that we have a living hope

997
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,560
 and that you can provide us life.

998
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,860
 God, whatever tomb we're wrapped up in,

999
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:37,940
 whether inside that tomb is a person

1000
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,040
 or a dream that we loved and lost,

1001
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,980
 or a hope that we loved and lost,

1002
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:47,100
 or maybe a part of ourselves that we hoped

1003
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,360
 and we loved and we lost.

1004
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:54,980
 God, will you resurrect not only the situation, God,

1005
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,500
 we're gonna pray bigger.

1006
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,640
 Will you resurrect our faith in you despite the situation?

1007
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,220
 Will you show us that when you delay,

1008
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,660
 you're not detaching, you're working.

1009
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,060
 When we cry, you cry.

1010
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,780
 You're emotionally moved by what moves us.

1011
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,400
 That means everything to us, God.

1012
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,660
 We offer ourselves to you, God,

1013
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,420
 not because nothing bad is gonna happen from here,

1014
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,320
 but because nothing meaningless is gonna happen from here.

1015
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,740
 It'll all be used, it'll all be worked

1016
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,540
 by you in your perfect hands,

1017
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,420
 in your kind-hearted, gentle, loving hands.

1018
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,620
 Thank you, God, that we don't just look

1019
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,820
 into stern, angry eyes when we look to you,

1020
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,740
 but we look in the tear-filled, heartfelt,

1021
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,820
 loving eyes of a father who hates it

1022
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,600
 when we go through things that hurt us.

1023
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,660
 We offer our heart to you, God,

1024
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,100
 because you can resurrect anything.

1025
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,420
 And we know you can resurrect us from our sin

1026
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,700
 and our pornography and our selfish habits

1027
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,620
 and our addictions we haven't admitted yet

1028
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,300
 and what happened over Labor Day

1029
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,880
 and everything we feel bad about from 10 years ago.

1030
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,860
 You can resurrect the whole thing,

1031
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,920
 and we worship you because only you have that power.

1032
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:16,920
