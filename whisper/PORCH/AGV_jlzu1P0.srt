1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,160
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:17,820
 - Love it.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,300
 Well, we are continuing through Colossians.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,940
 Anyone Six Flags fans here?

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,400
 There we go, a few of 'em.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,120
 Anyone ever been to Astroworld?

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,200
 Ever heard of this?

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,120
 There you go, okay, yeah, rest in peace, Astroworld.

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,160
 So I grew up in Houston, Texas,

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,600
 and me and I had two brothers, there you go,

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,680
 a couple of Houston folks.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,320
 Let's just keep playing this game.

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,440
 Who likes bread?

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,160
 Okay, so I grew up in Houston, Texas.

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,440
 I don't know where that came from.

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,560
 And me and my brothers would always go to Astroworld

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,720
 at Six Flags, it was like the greatest thing ever.

19
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,120
 We loved roller coasters, it was the thing we wanted to do

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,360
 for every birthday, for every fun event,

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,640
 Astroworld or Six Flags.

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,960
 And we would go, and we'd go on these roller coasters,

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,760
 and something happens when you go on roller coasters

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,720
 over and over and over again.

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,280
 They begin not being quite as exciting

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,680
 as they were the initial time,

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,200
 and so in order to make them more fun and more entertaining,

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,480
 we would develop little games to play on the roller coaster.

29
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,840
 And one of the games that we would play

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,040
 would be we would switch shirts

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,280
 with the person sitting next to us on the ride

32
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,400
 who we always knew and was always a male,

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,360
 and we would sit and we would switch shirts.

34
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,560
 So I'd start with a red shirt,

35
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,720
 my brothers has a yellow one,

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,880
 and we're switching, you and the ride,

37
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,360
 and that's what church kids do for fun.

38
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,800
 So we would play these games,

39
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,520
 and eventually we got to the point where even that

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,760
 was no longer as exciting or as entertaining.

41
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,480
 And so we decided that we would up the ante a little bit,

42
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,780
 and we would do a full body clothes switch,

43
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,200
 everything but underwear, shirts, shorts, and shoes.

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,120
 Some people are like, oh my gosh.

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,200
 Yeah, it was exciting.

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,280
 So we planned the whole thing out.

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,000
 Of course, it has to be like a roller coaster

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,080
 with at least two flips on it.

49
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,260
 Has to have one of those bars so you can't be buckled in,

50
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,120
 'cause that would kinda inhibit your ability to change.

51
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,840
 And we had just kind of a system developed

52
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,560
 to where I would know and I could confirm,

53
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,600
 you had to confirm, do you have the shirt?

54
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,320
 Because if you don't, it's gone,

55
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,600
 and one of us is leaving here without a shirt.

56
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,240
 So we had a whole thing planned out.

57
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,240
 We were gonna do this.

58
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,080
 We were pumped.

59
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,920
 We thought we could do a full body clothes switch.

60
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,040
 So me and this time it was a friend

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,400
 that I had dragged into doing this with me,

62
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,560
 and we get on the ride, and you couldn't start

63
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,360
 until click, click, click, click, you're on the descend.

64
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,900
 So we're headed up, click, click, click, and it hits me.

65
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,720
 My clothes are very different than his clothes.

66
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,480
 I'm wearing basketball shorts and a T-shirt,

67
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,880
 and he's wearing jeans and boots

68
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,120
 for whatever reason to Six Flags.

69
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,520
 And I'm going, oh my gosh,

70
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,860
 I'm working with like two inches of room here.

71
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,760
 How am I gonna be able to pull on jeans and get boots up?

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,080
 And the ride begins.

73
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,280
 And so we're going, we're going through,

74
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,720
 we do the shirt switch through one flip.

75
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,940
 We do the, we begin to do, this is so embarrassing.

76
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,440
 Where am I going with this?

77
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,200
 We're doing the pants switch, of course,

78
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,440
 and we're doing it, and so he's got the basketball shorts.

79
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,280
 I've got the jeans.

80
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,560
 Next flip, holding onto the boots and the jeans,

81
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,840
 trying to pull them up, going around the last turn,

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,680
 trying to get them up,

83
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,960
 trying to move within the two inches that I have.

84
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,840
 And then all of a sudden,

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,920
 we're coming down the final stretch and,

86
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,820
 and I didn't make it.

87
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,200
 And so I have to stand up,

88
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,360
 pull my pants up in front of the entire lines

89
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,720
 of everyone at Six Flags,

90
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,280
 as I walk off, we were like, what kind of ride is this?

91
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,040
 And so, of course, we went to the kiosk

92
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,200
 where they take the picture,

93
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,180
 'cause they're like, this is gonna be awesome.

94
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,580
 Where on the ride did this happen?

95
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,660
 And we go up to the kiosk,

96
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,620
 and you guys know what I'm talking about.

97
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,980
 There's like little pictures, they take the ride,

98
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,900
 and they have all the different carts,

99
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,580
 and you see the pictures.

100
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,580
 And then there's one, one screen that had our picture

101
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,740
 and, or it had where we should have been,

102
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,860
 and here's what it was.

103
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,580
 It literally was just that.

104
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,240
 Who even knew they had that on those things?

105
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,500
 And I go up to the lady, it's like, Shondra,

106
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,900
 hey, what happened to that one?

107
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,980
 And she says, inappropriate conduct,

108
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,620
 indecent exposure, inappropriate dress.

109
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,820
 And I was like, man, there are some bad people in this park.

110
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,100
 Not knowing if she makes a connection,

111
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,120
 hey, do you think I could just see it?

112
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,440
 Which I'm sure she thought was curious.

113
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,060
 And then eventually she makes a connection,

114
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,640
 and it's like, you're lucky.

115
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,620
 No, you can't see it, inappropriate conduct,

116
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,520
 you can't have the picture.

117
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,860
 You're lucky that I don't call the park security on you

118
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,820
 for indecent exposure.

119
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,180
 And her bottom line was, it was inappropriate dress,

120
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,700
 inappropriate conduct.

121
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,420
 And the reason I tell you that story,

122
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,060
 which may seem very random, watch this transition.

123
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,100
 The reason I tell you that story is because tonight,

124
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,140
 the Apostle Paul is gonna lay out and discuss

125
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,660
 in the book of Colossians what is appropriate conduct

126
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,980
 and what is inappropriate conduct

127
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,740
 within the life of a believer.

128
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,180
 We've been studying the book of Colossians

129
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,160
 and really for the past few weeks,

130
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,900
 we've gone through the first couple chapters

131
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,480
 and you may know this already,

132
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,160
 but when Paul writes a letter, typically what he'll do

133
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,540
 is for the first couple chapters, he will talk doctrine,

134
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,300
 he will discuss who you are in Christ,

135
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,500
 he's writing to the church

136
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,300
 and he'll lay out these doctrinal truths

137
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,900
 and then he'll get to practical application.

138
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,460
 And tonight, he's gonna go really practical

139
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,100
 and he's gonna say, this is what the appropriate conduct

140
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,100
 and appropriate dress for a believer is who's in Christ.

141
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,100
 And not only that, but this is why I think

142
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,700
 this is such an important message for all of us.

143
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,580
 He lays out how we get there.

144
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,540
 Like he doesn't just say, act this way,

145
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,960
 he says, let me tell you the path to take

146
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,220
 to assume this appropriate conduct.

147
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,740
 If you've ever wondered, man, why,

148
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,260
 if you're a Christian in the room,

149
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,700
 this is gonna be primarily for you,

150
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,500
 it may fill in some gaps if you are not a follower of Jesus,

151
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,020
 but if you're a follower of Jesus and you've ever wondered,

152
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,540
 why do I still do the things that I don't wanna do?

153
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,860
 I've been given a new nature, I've been made alive,

154
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,900
 I've been changed, Paul says in these first two chapters,

155
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,360
 you're totally complete, all these things

156
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,760
 that sometimes feel so far from me.

157
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,840
 How can I be the person that Christ says that I am?

158
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,420
 How can I stop doing the things I don't wanna do

159
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,340
 and do the things I believe are for me to do,

160
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,420
 what God calls me to do?

161
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,860
 So tonight, he's not only gonna tell us

162
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,540
 the appropriate conduct, but lay out for all of us

163
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,180
 how we get there and you just might be surprised

164
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,240
 about how we get there.

165
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,120
 But first, so we're gonna pick it up in Colossians 2,

166
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,860
 we're gonna start in verse 16,

167
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,160
 and then we'll work our way pretty quickly into chapter 3.

168
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,060
 He's gonna start and he's really gonna lay out

169
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,460
 when it comes to living the Christian life,

170
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,780
 how you don't do it.

171
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,340
 So he starts there and then he gets to how we do do it.

172
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,820
 So we're gonna pick it up in 16

173
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,660
 and really, I'm gonna read a paragraph for you

174
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,820
 that's gonna have all kinds of confusing terms.

175
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,420
 I don't want you to get lost on the terms.

176
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,540
 I'm gonna give you the big picture

177
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,420
 for the next five sentences, what he says.

178
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,980
 He basically says you don't do it

179
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,700
 through a bunch of new rules, rules, rules.

180
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,100
 You don't do it through a bunch of new rules,

181
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,060
 but something else.

182
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,680
 And he lays out a bunch of religious rules

183
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,620
 that people in the Church of Colossae were saying,

184
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,380
 this is what it looks like to live the new life.

185
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,380
 This is how you do it.

186
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,020
 And he says, no, that's not it, but here's where we go.

187
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,700
 Verse 16, therefore, after all that we've talked about

188
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,420
 already, that you're a new creation, you're complete,

189
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,220
 your sins have totally been paid for,

190
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,900
 past, present, future, you're made alive.

191
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,620
 Nothing can stop that because of faith in Jesus

192
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,100
 and what he did, not because of anything you did.

193
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,220
 So here we go.

194
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,400
 Therefore, do not let anyone judge you

195
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,580
 by what you eat or what you drink

196
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,020
 or with regard to a religious festival,

197
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,620
 a new moon celebration or a Sabbath day.

198
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,820
 So don't let anyone look down or judge you

199
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,900
 for not doing certain religious things.

200
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,100
 These are a shadow of the things that were to come.

201
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,900
 The reality, however, is found in Christ.

202
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,380
 Do not let anyone who delights in false humility

203
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,340
 and the worship of angels disqualify you.

204
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,680
 Such a person also goes into great detail

205
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,860
 about what they have seen.

206
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,460
 They are puffed up with idle notions

207
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,660
 by their unspiritual mind.

208
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,820
 They have lost connection to the head, speaking of Christ,

209
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,620
 from whom the whole body is supported

210
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,380
 and held together by its ligaments

211
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,340
 and sin whose growth as God,

212
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,100
 grows as God causes it to grow.

213
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,700
 What are we talking about, Paul?

214
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,620
 Verse 20, since you died with Christ

215
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,980
 to the element of spiritual forces of this world,

216
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,340
 why then do you act as though you still belong to the world?

217
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,620
 Do you still submit to its rules?

218
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,680
 Verse 21, do not handle, do not taste, do not touch.

219
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,500
 These rules, which have to do with things

220
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,380
 that are destined to perish with use,

221
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,540
 are based only on human commands and teachings.

222
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,240
 Such regulations indeed have the appearance,

223
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,860
 this religious acts have the appearance of wisdom

224
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,500
 with their self-imposed worship,

225
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,280
 their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body,

226
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,140
 but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.

227
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,800
 So Paul basically says, look, living the new life,

228
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,740
 let me start with what it is in case you're going,

229
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,360
 what, new moons, festivals and celebrations?

230
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,800
 Yeah, the next time somebody tries to look down on you

231
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,260
 for a new moon celebration, I'm kidding, bad joke.

232
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,820
 Okay, so in 16th, what he's basically laying out,

233
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,840
 hey, these are all religious things

234
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,680
 that you are being told you need to do

235
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,240
 to live out the new life, and Paul says,

236
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,000
 no, those are not it at all, those are silly things.

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,880
 The vision and worship of angels, new moon festivals,

238
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,720
 that's not how you live out the new life.

239
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,720
 Here's how you live out the new life, starting in verse one.

240
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,380
 Since then, you have been raised with Christ.

241
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,380
 Speaking of the resurrection, so you may not know this,

242
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,980
 but when you came to faith in Jesus,

243
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,420
 if you're a follower of Jesus, when you said,

244
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,700
 I trust Jesus paid on the cross for my sins,

245
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,740
 Paul, and the Bible teaches that you

246
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,180
 died with Christ on the cross

247
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,560
 and you were resurrected with him,

248
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,460
 that you went through a resurrection in a spiritual sense,

249
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,780
 and you're going, what, when did I die, when did I rise?

250
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,900
 In a spiritual sense, when Jesus died and Jesus rose,

251
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,540
 he gave you a new life, just like he came back to life,

252
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,820
 you died and you were given a new life.

253
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,580
 There's gonna come a day where you will physically rise,

254
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,440
 but spiritually speaking, Paul says,

255
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,020
 you have already been resurrected

256
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,700
 and already previously died.

257
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,060
 And since that has taken place,

258
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,220
 set your hearts on things above,

259
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,020
 where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God,

260
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,580
 set your minds on things above, not on earthly things,

261
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,020
 for you died and your life is now hidden

262
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,060
 with Christ in God, this is our first point.

263
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,060
 We are made new, this is how believers are made new,

264
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,820
 by our resurrection, not religion.

265
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,140
 We are made new by our resurrection,

266
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,240
 that when Christ died, we died with him,

267
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,820
 and spiritually speaking, we were given new life,

268
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,860
 that you have gone through in a spiritual sense,

269
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,300
 you've been given a new life, and the way you embrace

270
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,700
 this new life is so huge.

271
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,220
 The way you and I begin to start embracing

272
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,920
 the new life that we have, all begins on the inside.

273
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,140
 It all begins, according to Paul, look at the verse,

274
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,340
 set your hearts, set your minds on things above.

275
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,100
 That God is not a God, he's not saying,

276
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,220
 hey, here's a bunch of rules,

277
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,540
 this is how you do the new life.

278
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,480
 God says, I don't work outside in, I work inside out.

279
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,820
 My goal is not for you to just do good things

280
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,380
 and change you from a good person to a better person,

281
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,340
 I take dead people and I make them alive.

282
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,980
 That's how I work, and I work from the inside out.

283
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,700
 My goal is not just for you to stop being anxious,

284
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,340
 and for you to not go to the bars,

285
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,380
 and stop looking at porn, I want your heart to be changed.

286
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,360
 So Paul says, in order to begin embracing

287
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,460
 your resurrected life, it starts with the mind,

288
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,260
 and it starts with the heart,

289
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,420
 and fixing it on things that are eternal.

290
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,860
 He says, if you and I can begin to focus

291
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,420
 not on what's going on around us,

292
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,340
 not on this earth, not on things that are passing away,

293
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,980
 but fixing our eyes on what's eternal,

294
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,440
 on what matters, on the fact that we're gonna be here

295
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,180
 for only a few more instants, then it's gonna be gone,

296
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,060
 we're gonna be with Christ forever and ever and ever.

297
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:36,060
 That's, he says, where change begins to take place.

298
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,540
 If you and I can orient our minds around the reality

299
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,140
 of the future eternity awaiting us,

300
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,500
 and the resurrection that you have already experienced

301
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,620
 in Christ, through faith in Christ, change begins.

302
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,860
 Here's how I know that's true.

303
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,420
 If you and I really come to grips with the fact

304
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,700
 that we have, in Christ, died and be given a new life,

305
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,740
 gone through a resurrection, we would begin

306
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,180
 to experience life in a whole new, different way.

307
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,960
 There was a guy, actually, in the Bible,

308
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,180
 you may know this story, who actually really gives us

309
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,460
 a great example of what it looks like

310
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,140
 when a person really understands

311
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,340
 and really experiences death and new life.

312
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,060
 His name was Lazarus.

313
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,140
 Jesus comes up to a guy named Lazarus.

314
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,180
 Lazarus is a single young adult.

315
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,180
 His closest friends are his two sisters, Mary and Martha.

316
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,980
 You probably heard this story.

317
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,620
 They're really close with Jesus.

318
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,260
 There comes a day where Lazarus, this is in John 11,

319
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,400
 if you wanna go read this later,

320
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,400
 where Lazarus, he gets sick, and he dies.

321
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,320
 The next scene we're given is really,

322
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,580
 they're at the funeral, and Lazarus is in the tomb,

323
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,780
 and Jesus shows up, and he's talking with the family,

324
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,680
 and the family says, "Oh, man, if you had only been here."

325
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,680
 And Jesus says, "Lazarus, come out of the tomb."

326
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,820
 And Lazarus walks out of the tomb alive.

327
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,900
 This man who had been dead

328
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,300
 had been totally raised back to life.

329
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,740
 Now, let me ask you this.

330
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:11,160
 Do you think after walking through death and resurrection,

331
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,080
 Lazarus' life the second time around

332
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,660
 was different than the first time?

333
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,360
 In other words, Lazarus dies.

334
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,000
 He's a single young adult.

335
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 He's got bills to pay.

336
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,240
 He's trying to figure things out.

337
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,480
 Maybe he would be a porchy,

338
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,200
 and he's trying to figure out life, and then he dies.

339
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,360
 Do you think when he comes back to life,

340
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,640
 he's worried, anxious, bogged down

341
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,120
 about the things he used to be?

342
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,960
 Like, he's still going, "Oh, my gosh, great.

343
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,680
 "I'm back, and I'm still single, God.

344
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,720
 "How am I gonna afford rent in Jerusalem?

345
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,700
 "It's out of control in here.

346
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,000
 "Unbelievable, this world has fallen apart."

347
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,580
 Do you think that after experiencing this new life,

348
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,880
 that the things, even the way he saw this life was the same?

349
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,540
 In fact, the next chapter, we're told that really,

350
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,660
 because Jesus raised him from the dead,

351
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,200
 and crowds, like, it exploded.

352
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,680
 Jesus' followers exploded

353
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,660
 'cause he raised the guy from the dead,

354
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,280
 which just happens if you raise somebody from the dead,

355
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,640
 I guess, and so all these people are following Jesus,

356
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,520
 and the religious elite said, "We need to kill Lazarus, too."

357
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,720
 And word gets back to Lazarus.

358
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,920
 Do you think it scared Lazarus that time?

359
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,080
 He's like, "They're gonna kill me.

360
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,120
 "I've been there, done that.

361
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,600
 "What am I afraid of anymore?

362
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,380
 "Jesus is all that matters."

363
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,960
 And Paul continues, really, around this idea

364
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,760
 of if we could understand that as real as Lazarus

365
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,980
 being raised from the dead

366
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,620
 was you being raised from the dead and given new life,

367
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,540
 it would change everything.

368
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,440
 He continues saying, in verse four,

369
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,440
 "When Christ, who is your life, appears,

370
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,720
 "then you will also be with him,

371
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,520
 "or you will appear with him in glory."

372
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,540
 That Christ is your life.

373
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,860
 I mean, this was so real to Paul.

374
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,540
 Jesus is not a concept.

375
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,580
 Jesus is not a component of life.

376
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,540
 He says Jesus is life.

377
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,820
 Remember those shirts that say baseball is life?

378
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,940
 Baseball's not life.

379
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,240
 Shopping is not life.

380
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,580
 Sex is not life.

381
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,800
 Marriage is not life.

382
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,580
 Jesus is life, Paul says.

383
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,480
 Ironically, in the same passage, John 11,

384
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,980
 when Jesus comes up to the tomb,

385
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,580
 and they said, "If only you had been here,

386
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,120
 "Lazarus would not be dead.

387
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,040
 "He would be alive.

388
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,000
 "He would have life."

389
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,360
 And Jesus responds, saying, "I am life.

390
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,960
 "I am all that life is about.

391
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,420
 "I'm all it will ever be about.

392
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,220
 "I'm the only place you will ever find

393
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,120
 "true satisfaction in life."

394
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,000
 Jesus is life.

395
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,420
 He is not a component.

396
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,680
 He is life.

397
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,060
 He's all, and if you know him,

398
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,640
 that's why Jesus is the only thing that will ever satisfy.

399
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,300
 Really, regardless, he's the only thing.

400
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,760
 But especially if you've been raised

401
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,160
 to walk in newness of life.

402
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,360
 And he is your life, Paul says.

403
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,500
 He now continues and says,

404
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,560
 "How do we live out this new life?"

405
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,680
 And he begins, really, by talking about our old life.

406
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,000
 Verse five.

407
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,400
 "Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs,"

408
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,920
 so set your minds on things above,

409
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,080
 "and put to death whatever belongs to your earthly nature."

410
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,460
 Let me just say what he just said.

411
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,900
 He just said, "People who have been raised

412
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,720
 "to new life in Christ have earthly nature,"

413
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,240
 or sin nature, you may have if you have the ESV,

414
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,620
 inside of them.

415
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,140
 It doesn't just immediately go away,

416
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,360
 they have to put it to death, or put an end to it,

417
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,000
 Paul says, and now he's gonna tell us

418
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,820
 some of what we are to put an end to.

419
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,820
 "Sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires,

420
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,000
 "greed, which is idolatry.

421
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,360
 "Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.

422
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,460
 "You used to walk in these ways in the life you once lived,

423
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,620
 "but now you must also rid yourself

424
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,220
 "of all such things as these, anger, rage,

425
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,420
 "malice, slander, filthy language from your lips.

426
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,080
 "Do not lie to each other."

427
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,620
 So he says, "Take all of these things

428
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,560
 "that are part of your old nature,

429
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,000
 "and I want you to put an end to them."

430
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,440
 And he's about to tell us how,

431
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,620
 but I think if you're back in church

432
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,660
 for the first time in a long time,

433
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,460
 or maybe first time ever,

434
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,700
 oftentimes what Christians hear

435
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,400
 when they read a verse like this

436
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,360
 is just Paul saying, "Stop lying,

437
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,580
 "stop thinking lustful thoughts,

438
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,140
 "stop being angry, stop being filled with rage,

439
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,260
 "just stop cussing, even when you're in traffic,

440
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,660
 "stop all those things, just stop it."

441
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,900
 And so we hear that message,

442
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,980
 and maybe even tonight, or even on messages

443
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,500
 that we're not trying to communicate exactly that,

444
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,080
 or that's not the fullness of it,

445
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,040
 you hear that, and then you go,

446
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,960
 "Yes, this is gonna be my week.

447
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,580
 "I'm not cussing in any traffic.

448
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,660
 "I'm out of here, I'll be here next week, no cussing."

449
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,280
 Then we go out, "No, I said it again.

450
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,060
 "Okay, I'm back, I'm gonna try it again this next week."

451
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,200
 Paul would say, "That doesn't work.

452
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,560
 "It's not just stop, stop it.

453
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,060
 "That doesn't work."

454
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,180
 But he does tell us how and why, and how we stop.

455
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,980
 Here's what he says.

456
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,640
 "Since you have taken off the old self and its practices,

457
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,700
 "and you've put on the new self,

458
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,780
 "which is being you've been given a new self,

459
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,100
 "and it's not fully new."

460
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,020
 In other words, there's still renewal that takes place,

461
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,060
 and is being renewed in knowledge,

462
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,740
 in the image of its creator.

463
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,740
 Paul just said, "The way and the process

464
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,640
 "through which you and I, who've been given a new self,

465
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,140
 "become increasingly new, is through the process

466
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,240
 "of what the Bible calls renewal."

467
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,700
 That you and I, the way that we put off the old,

468
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,020
 and put on the on, we're gonna discuss in a second,

469
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,780
 is through the process of what Scripture calls renewal,

470
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,420
 or renewing our mind.

471
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,900
 This is what Romans 12, two says.

472
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,660
 "This is how you and I are transformed."

473
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,740
 It's not through just stop it, try harder,

474
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,380
 motivational pep talks, it's through renewal.

475
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,220
 That's how it takes place.

476
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,280
 This is what Romans 12, two.

477
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,940
 "Do not conform to the pattern of this world,

478
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,020
 "but be transformed."

479
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,180
 How do I get transformed, Paul?

480
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:15,020
 By renewing, or by the renewing of your mind.

481
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,620
 This is how you transform.

482
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,160
 This is how you change.

483
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,860
 If you are struggling right now, with anxiety,

484
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,300
 or with a sexual relationship, or with materialism,

485
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,920
 whatever it is, insert fill in the blank,

486
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,380
 the way you change is not me going,

487
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,440
 no, stop it, stop it right now.

488
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,480
 That's not how you change.

489
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,460
 Paul says, "The process by which we change is renewal."

490
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,660
 Having our minds renewed.

491
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,840
 Now what is renewal?

492
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,260
 When the Bible speaks about renewal,

493
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,980
 it speaks, renew means make again new, again new.

494
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,380
 That's what renew means.

495
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,340
 And when the Bible speaks of the process of renewal,

496
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,500
 there's really two components of it.

497
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,180
 It involves taking off and putting on.

498
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,820
 It's like when girls do nail polish,

499
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,640
 and you guys use that stuff that eats through the floor,

500
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,900
 if it gets on there, it's like, what is that called?

501
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,740
 Whatever it's called.

502
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,960
 You gotta take it off, right?

503
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,580
 My wife is so embarrassed right now.

504
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,300
 You gotta take it off, and then you gotta paint,

505
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,540
 or then you put on the other one.

506
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,300
 And so in the same way, renewal takes place,

507
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,700
 and it's not called painting, is it?

508
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,460
 Renewal takes place when you take off and you put on.

509
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,060
 Now what do we take off and put on?

510
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,660
 'Cause it's renewing our mind.

511
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,740
 The process by which we take off, or what we take off,

512
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,760
 is the lies that you and I believe

513
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,500
 that fuel our bad behavior.

514
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,980
 And we put on the truth about reality,

515
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,940
 about the world around us, truth all found in God's word.

516
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,900
 But we renew our mind by taking off the lie

517
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,960
 and putting on the truth.

518
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,340
 'Cause here's what I know about you, and I know about me.

519
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,900
 Every bad behavior, every sinful behavior,

520
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,660
 every struggle that you have is fueled by a lie.

521
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,940
 Right now, everything.

522
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,260
 Every time that you sin, it's fueled by a lie.

523
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,140
 Satan is called the deceiver of the entire world,

524
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,380
 Revelation 12 calls him.

525
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,460
 That your problem, anytime you're like,

526
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,780
 oh man, I'm just struggling, I need to get better,

527
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,660
 is because you're believing a lie at some level.

528
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,560
 In my, even marriage with my wife, our conflicts,

529
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,360
 we have conflict Sunday night,

530
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,320
 driving back from me doing a wedding.

531
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,280
 And we have conflict 'cause I'm selfish.

532
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,120
 You know why I'm selfish?

533
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,620
 'Cause that selfishness is fueled by a lie

534
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,280
 that my wife is here to serve me.

535
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,040
 And it's a lie.

536
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,680
 When God's word and truth tells me

537
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,240
 that I have been put into a mutually submissive relationship

538
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,260
 where I am there to serve her.

539
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,600
 If you are struggling with an eating disorder,

540
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,440
 it's fueled by a lie.

541
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,860
 It may not be all the same one, but it is fueled by a lie.

542
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,920
 Satan comes to deceive, to kill, and to destroy.

543
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,680
 Pornography, fueled by a lie.

544
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,300
 Sleeping with your boyfriend, fueled by a lie.

545
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,200
 Anxiety, fueled by a lie.

546
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,900
 I'm in control, or I'm afraid God's not in control.

547
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,820
 Or I'm afraid God's not really good and in control.

548
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:06,040
 Or I think my way would be better than his way.

549
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,880
 All those different circles are fueled by lies.

550
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,960
 And Paul says, the way you change,

551
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,760
 this is how people change.

552
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,960
 It's not they just finally go,

553
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,960
 I'm putting my boots on, this is my day.

554
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,340
 It's by taking off the old and putting on the new.

555
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,880
 Renewing your mind.

556
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,980
 If you change, you are a new person.

557
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,720
 You have a new self.

558
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,720
 And you renew that new self by changing the way you think.

559
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,680
 Taking off the lies, putting on the truth of God's word.

560
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,300
 And that changes how you live.

561
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,280
 This is why some of you,

562
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,720
 like you're in the room and you've been struggling

563
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,640
 for a while with whatever it is.

564
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,500
 And you just are like, man, I feel hopeless.

565
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,240
 I've prayed the prayer to accept Christ like 27 times,

566
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,780
 and I just can't seem to get over X,

567
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,680
 my anxiety, my pornography, whatever it is.

568
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,040
 That's not the problem at all.

569
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,000
 For some of you, maybe you should trust Christ.

570
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,760
 But for some of you who have, the problem is renewal.

571
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
 You haven't renewed your mind.

572
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,640
 There's no secret there.

573
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,960
 This is the process by which people change

574
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,420
 and pulses we take off by putting on the new.

575
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:23,240
 Verse 11, he continues, and I wish we really had time

576
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,560
 to cover this more fully, but we'll comb through it

577
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,480
 and then pop on to our next point.

578
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,520
 "Here in Christ, there is no Gentile or Jew,"

579
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,040
 so there's no racial distinction.

580
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,160
 "There is no circumcised or uncircumcised."

581
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,340
 In other words, there's no religious distinction.

582
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,920
 "There is no barbarian or Scythian,"

583
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,280
 which is the barbarians were,

584
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,040
 basically, there's no education distinction.

585
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,760
 Barbarians were called that

586
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,600
 because they couldn't speak Greek.

587
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,480
 Well, they would, bah, bah, bah.

588
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,640
 (audience laughing)

589
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,040
 I hear bah, bah, bah, ran every time I do that.

590
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,880
 I don't know why, but I do.

591
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,720
 My team was like, don't say that.

592
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,480
 I was like, I'm gonna do my best.

593
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,600
 Just come down.

594
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,760
 Scythian was the same thing.

595
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,140
 It's just like, rogue, bad, were like the barbarians.

596
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,620
 Slave or free, there's no distinction,

597
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,540
 but Christ is all that matters,

598
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,140
 and Christ lives in all of us.

599
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,620
 That he says there are no categories inside of the church,

600
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,020
 inside of God's people, through Christ.

601
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,460
 He's all that matters, and he lives in all of us.

602
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,500
 Social distinctions, the color of your skin,

603
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,780
 the amount that you make, none of it matters.

604
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,980
 Christ is all that matters.

605
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,180
 And if he lives in them, there's no distinction

606
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,240
 between them and the next person,

607
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,220
 who he lives in, his followers.

608
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,100
 I mean, I wish we had time to camp here,

609
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,860
 'cause I feel like our nation is so hurting right now.

610
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,980
 And how you look around at Baltimore,

611
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,220
 you look around at what's been going on

612
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,920
 for the past few months in New York, Ferguson,

613
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,720
 and how important it is that the church,

614
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,660
 there be a body of people, Paul says,

615
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,640
 that when they come together,

616
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,780
 what defines them is not their skin tone.

617
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,460
 What defines them is not the job that they work.

618
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,380
 What defines them is not where they grew up,

619
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,500
 or where they were born.

620
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,380
 What defines them is Jesus, he's all that matters.

621
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,100
 And they know that, and they believe that,

622
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,340
 and they've trusted in that, and that is a group of people.

623
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,500
 And when people begin to see,

624
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,900
 when the world sees a group like that, it's powerful.

625
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,020
 That's how change happens.

626
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,380
 That's how the church, in those situations,

627
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,060
 can be the church, and can rise up and say,

628
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,560
 it may happen here, it may happen in that city,

629
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,180
 but it's not gonna happen inside of God's people.

630
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,940
 It's not gonna happen here.

631
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,080
 We gotta keep moving.

632
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,520
 Okay, that was a sad note, probably, hopefully worth it.

633
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,140
 Verse 12, therefore, as God's chosen,

634
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,980
 so he begins to tell us what the new life looks like.

635
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,900
 So this is what the new life,

636
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,620
 so you take off through renewing your mind,

637
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,580
 and here's what it looks like

638
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,180
 whenever you begin to renew your mind,

639
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,640
 and here's what the new life looks like.

640
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,100
 Therefore, as God's chosen people,

641
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,340
 holy and dearly loved, I'm gonna read that again.

642
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:03,740
 Therefore, as God's chosen people, if you're a Christian,

643
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:11,000
 as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved,

644
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,480
 you know what Paul just said?

645
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,900
 He just said that when God looks at you,

646
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:23,520
 if you know Jesus, he doesn't see your sin from today,

647
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,760
 he doesn't see your sin from yesterday.

648
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,520
 When he looks at you, he sees,

649
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,920
 and he knows all the sin from your past life.

650
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,220
 He knows everything you've done today

651
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,080
 and will do tomorrow and the next day,

652
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,800
 and he looks at you because of your faith in Jesus,

653
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,240
 and he says, "Mine, chosen, I love you,

654
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,740
 "righteous, holy, mine."

655
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,320
 That's who you are.

656
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,500
 If you've trusted in Christ, that's who you are,

657
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,240
 and some of you, that's what you need to hear

658
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,400
 more than anything else in this message.

659
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,280
 That's who you are.

660
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,280
 That's who you are, righteous, holy, loved.

661
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,800
 And as those people, here's what he's gonna tell us

662
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,800
 to clothe ourselves with, compassion, kindness, clothes.

663
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,380
 Let these be the things that you put on each day,

664
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,380
 like the clothes you wear, humility, gentleness, patience.

665
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,740
 Bear with each other and forgive one another

666
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,180
 if any of you has a grievance against someone.

667
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,540
 Forgive as the Lord forgave you,

668
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,060
 and over all of these virtues, put on love,

669
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:35,460
 which binds them all together in perfect unity.

670
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,280
 That these are the church clothes.

671
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,220
 Remember when you were a kid and your mom,

672
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,560
 maybe this is just me, my mom,

673
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,400
 she would come in and be like,

674
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,220
 "We gotta get ready for church here, put on this,"

675
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,500
 and then I would put something on,

676
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,060
 and she'd be like, "You can't wear that.

677
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,280
 "You can't wear soccer shorts to church.

678
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,460
 "You have to bring your finest

679
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,300
 "to the house of the Lord."

680
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,180
 And I'd always be like, "What?

681
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,680
 "Why does God want me in khakis?

682
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,120
 "What, why do I have to wear these things?"

683
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,780
 The clothes that are to mark the church,

684
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,700
 turns out those were not the clothes

685
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,740
 that are to mark the church.

686
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,860
 But love, compassion, gentleness, kindness,

687
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,300
 these are church clothes.

688
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,500
 These are to be the things that Christians adore.

689
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,500
 This is honestly why people have a bad perception

690
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,320
 of the church, is because there's so many believers

691
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,100
 running around without their clothes on,

692
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,240
 to use the metaphor that Paul uses here.

693
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,440
 They're not running around clothed with love,

694
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,620
 kindness, compassion, gentleness.

695
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,540
 They're running around clothed

696
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,460
 with either form or life clothes,

697
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,360
 and Paul says these are the things that you are to put on.

698
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,220
 And it's like, how attractive are these?

699
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,700
 Like, humility looks good on everybody.

700
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,180
 Love looks good on everybody.

701
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,040
 Kindness looks good on everyone.

702
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,660
 Unlike the opposite things of our sinful nature,

703
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,260
 where it's like, no one's ever thought,

704
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,420
 oh my gosh, let me tell you what's hot, anger.

705
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,940
 Greed, he was greedy.

706
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,120
 No one's ever thought.

707
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,500
 What is wrong with me?

708
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,940
 I have too much coffee today.

709
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,260
 But it's true, right?

710
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,100
 Like, these are the things.

711
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,840
 These are the things the church is meant to put on.

712
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,520
 These are the things that we are to put on.

713
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,740
 And here's how we really do it.

714
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,560
 Here's how we, through renewing our mind,

715
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,180
 we take off and we put on,

716
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,140
 and here's one of the ways that we renew our mind.

717
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,060
 Verse 15 and 16.

718
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,500
 Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts,

719
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,380
 since as members of one body, you were called to peace.

720
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,980
 So live in peace with one another.

721
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,700
 He begins to talk about one another.

722
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,520
 And be thankful.

723
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,000
 Let the message of Christ dwell among you together,

724
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,740
 richly or abundantly, you may have in there.

725
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,620
 Let it be saturated with the abundance of Christ's words

726
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,940
 in your midst together,

727
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,900
 and admonish and teach one another.

728
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,820
 The message of Christ is in like the gospels,

729
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,060
 the Bible, it would translate for us.

730
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,780
 Let that be among your lips as you talk and engage

731
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,740
 with one another with all wisdom through psalms,

732
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,700
 hymns, and songs from the Spirit,

733
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,700
 singing to God with gratitude in your heart.

734
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,580
 So Paul just said, what, get together and sing?

735
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,860
 Like Christian karaoke?

736
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,900
 That's not what he's saying.

737
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,400
 He's saying, in this culture, they didn't have Bibles.

738
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,220
 You probably know that, but they really,

739
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,460
 this was early on, they had just maybe a letter, maybe two.

740
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,020
 And they would get together, and Paul says,

741
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,740
 I want you to take the teachings that you know

742
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,540
 from Jesus and his apostles.

743
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,820
 I want you to sing together as you come together.

744
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,060
 I want you to speak into each other's lives.

745
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,980
 I want you to sing songs to one another

746
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,660
 and gather around each other,

747
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,460
 that you and I are to be marked with new relationships.

748
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,300
 That's our third point,

749
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,680
 new relationships with God's people renders change,

750
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,920
 that you and I are to get together.

751
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,780
 And why are they talking about Jesus's word to one another?

752
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,900
 Why are they singing songs?

753
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,620
 They renew each other's mind.

754
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,400
 This is what Paul's driving towards,

755
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,540
 that as you come together,

756
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,760
 I want you to speak to one another the truth.

757
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,540
 This is why we harp on community so much around here,

758
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,820
 because all of us need, I need you, and you need me,

759
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,060
 and we gotta come together, and we lock arms.

760
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,320
 That's what we do in community,

761
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,300
 and we speak the truth to one another.

762
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,780
 We speak from God's word,

763
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,780
 and we help each other take off the lie.

764
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,300
 I'm not letting you go, and I need you to not let me go,

765
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,900
 because we're all broken.

766
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,580
 There's no special pastorage up here where we don't,

767
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,300
 I'm jacked up just like everyone else in this room.

768
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,500
 There is no Superman.

769
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,800
 We're all just mere mortals who are all prone to go crazy.

770
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,480
 This is why we harp on community,

771
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,420
 'cause if you and I do not renew our mind,

772
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,100
 you will not live new, and neither will I.

773
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,060
 And so we get together every single week.

774
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,900
 We look in the whites of each other's eyes.

775
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,460
 We say, I know you're broken, and I'm gonna help you,

776
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,560
 and I need you to help me.

777
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,760
 Will you speak the truth when I'm drifting away,

778
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,500
 when I want to look at something I shouldn't be looking at,

779
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,620
 when I'm anxious and I shouldn't be anxious,

780
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,300
 when I'm driven by people-pleasing,

781
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,980
 will you tell me and call me out?

782
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,100
 Will you speak to me?

783
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,700
 Will you help me renew my mind?

784
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,540
 That's what they're doing.

785
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,100
 Paul says, I want you to get together,

786
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,460
 and I want you to speak God's word over each other.

787
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,140
 I want you to sing songs together

788
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,580
 so that your minds on a day-by-day process are renewed.

789
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,300
 That's how you change.

790
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,880
 That's how you change.

791
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,540
 There's no magic secret sauce.

792
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,100
 It's just an everyday moments,

793
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,460
 everyday, ordinary moments where we get together,

794
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,500
 and a lot of you do this every single week.

795
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,100
 It's your experience and change.

796
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,820
 In coffee shops all over the city,

797
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,900
 on Wednesday mornings and Friday mornings

798
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,900
 and Tuesday after the porch and Monday nights

799
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,560
 and all every day of the week,

800
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,340
 people gather around and they speak the truth

801
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,580
 to one another.

802
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,980
 That's what he's driving at.

803
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:35,100
 Because left by ourself, our minds don't get renewed.

804
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,260
 Renewal is a team sport.

805
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,140
 I need you and you need me.

806
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,300
 And it's through the one another's

807
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:47,060
 we begin to experience change thinking, change lives.

808
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,540
 And this really isn't new.

809
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:55,840
 This really has been the way God's always done it.

810
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,620
 From the very beginning.

811
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,700
 It's not good for man to be alone.

812
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,340
 There's 62 one anothers in the New Testament.

813
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,180
 62 verses or 62 places where it talks about

814
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,860
 do this one another, one another,

815
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,180
 be together, one another.

816
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,680
 That's who you are, my people.

817
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,280
 Help each other, renew each other's mind.

818
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,080
 Come together.

819
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,040
 And the earliest, outside of the Bible,

820
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,080
 you know the earliest reference to Christian literature

821
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,380
 that we have actually comes from a governor

822
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,280
 not far from Colossae.

823
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,960
 So inside of the Roman Empire,

824
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,040
 there was a guy who in 111 AD,

825
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,560
 this is so amazing to me and probably only me,

826
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,700
 hopefully not, but so in 111 AD,

827
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,200
 there was a guy named Pliny the Younger

828
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,080
 and he's the governor of an area in Turkey

829
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,120
 which is where Colossae is.

830
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,800
 And he's writing to the emperor and it's 111,

831
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,840
 it's 10 years after John, the apostle John,

832
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,040
 remember him, took care of Jesus' mom,

833
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,160
 10 years after John's dead.

834
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,780
 So this is early in the game.

835
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,600
 And he's writing and Pliny who's not a Christian,

836
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,400
 he writes to the emperor of Rome and he says,

837
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,320
 there's all these Christians popping up everywhere.

838
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,600
 What am I supposed to do with them?

839
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,240
 I've never really handled Christians before

840
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,080
 but they're everywhere.

841
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,600
 He says in the letter, you should Google,

842
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,320
 Pliny the Younger to Trajan,

843
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,080
 Pliny the Younger for those of you

844
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,240
 who wanna look it up later.

845
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,360
 And in the letter, he says, there's Christians

846
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,400
 and they're exploding of every age, every sex,

847
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,640
 every area of life, they're coming

848
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,920
 and these Christians, they're going into the cities

849
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,880
 and into the towns, what should I do with them?

850
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,640
 And he says, I've begun to investigate

851
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,120
 and I began torturing to find out from them

852
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,680
 what they're all about 'cause I don't really know

853
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,400
 what Christians are all about.

854
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,640
 What do you think I should do, Trajan?

855
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,680
 And in that letter, Pliny says this

856
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,680
 about what he discovered about this new cult

857
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,520
 that he didn't understand.

858
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,020
 This is what they were doing.

859
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:53,760
 The sum and substance of their fault or error

860
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,880
 had been they were accustomed to meet on a fixed day.

861
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,080
 This is your heritage.

862
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,680
 Before dawn and sing a response

863
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,240
 that they'd come together on a fixed day before work,

864
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,560
 they'd get together and it's still dark

865
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,880
 and they would sing a song to Christ as God.

866
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,280
 And then they would bind themselves with an oath

867
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,200
 and it wasn't an oath to commit some crime, I love that.

868
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,160
 Pliny's thinking, how bizarre are these people?

869
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,080
 They would bind themselves not to commit a crime

870
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,780
 but to not commit a crime, to not commit fraud,

871
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,320
 to not commit theft, to not commit adultery

872
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,160
 or to falsify their trust or to keep their word.

873
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,360
 They would come together and they'd say,

874
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,280
 I need you, will you help me today?

875
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,840
 I don't wanna commit adultery today.

876
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,520
 I don't wanna lie, I don't wanna steal, will you help me?

877
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,760
 And they sang to Christ all together.

878
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,000
 And then it says this, after they were done,

879
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,040
 when this was over, it was their custom to depart

880
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,000
 and then they would come back together

881
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,280
 and they would partake of food.

882
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,840
 So they would leave, they'd go to their jobs

883
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,840
 and they'd come back together and they would eat

884
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,080
 and they would help each other and say,

885
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,680
 look, we're not gonna get focused

886
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,360
 on things that are on this earth.

887
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,320
 We're gonna fix our eyes as long as we're on this planet

888
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,800
 on things that are eternal and I don't do that on my own.

889
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,560
 So I need help.

890
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,400
 And today, collectively, we're gonna take an oath.

891
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,240
 I mean, how amazing is that?

892
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,760
 It's Pliny's writing in the letter, he's going,

893
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,400
 why are we arresting these people?

894
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,660
 They're the best Romans we have.

895
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:29,400
 And they came together day after day, renewing their mind.

896
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,240
 This is how it's always been done.

897
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,760
 This is how change happens.

898
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,300
 That's how you change.

899
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,240
 That's how Christians change.

900
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,720
 I know across the room, for those of us who are believers,

901
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,960
 I mean, we have every type of,

902
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,240
 if you're in a community group or a Bible study,

903
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,240
 I think the question that I ask when I look at this

904
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,680
 is how am I doing at this?

905
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,560
 Is it not enough to just have a group,

906
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,920
 but am I coming together?

907
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,880
 Am I renewing my mind?

908
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,480
 Are people speaking into my life?

909
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,100
 Am I taking off the lies?

910
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,080
 Am I replacing with truth, with others speaking in?

911
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,560
 Help me not go after what looks dead.

912
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,800
 I have a new self, and tomorrow morning,

913
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,920
 I'm gonna wake up and I'm gonna go wander

914
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,900
 after what's dead.

915
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,400
 So I need you to help me.

916
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,080
 How am I doing at that?

917
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,120
 How are you doing at that?

918
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,320
 Do you have that group?

919
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,720
 That's why we harp, not 'cause we're like,

920
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,200
 we just love community groups.

921
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,960
 It's in the watermark name.

922
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,500
 Because we believe that's how God's always done it,

923
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,660
 how we'll always do it.

924
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:38,060
 Every night at the porch,

925
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,100
 we have open community group afterwards.

926
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,820
 There's one thing you can be a part of here.

927
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,700
 It's not the porch, and I mean at watermark.

928
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,900
 It's being, doing life with other people,

929
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,620
 renewing your mind.

930
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:53,380
 Because what happened to this group, Pliny referenced,

931
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,080
 is that as they came together, they were changed.

932
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,260
 And they changed the world.

933
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,460
 They changed Asia Minor.

934
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,520
 They exploded.

935
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,440
 That's what happened.

936
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,400
 If you go back and read church history,

937
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,040
 as people see the new life lived out.

938
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,600
 If you're not a believer, man, we'd love to talk to you

939
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,400
 about where you are in the faith journey.

940
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,200
 The reason you can't live out the new life

941
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,240
 is you don't have new life.

942
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,620
 But God offers that to you.

943
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:29,380
 Just by believing, it's better news than you can imagine.

944
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,480
 There's nothing you can do to earn it.

945
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,480
 And he offers it to you if you'll just accept it.

946
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,600
 And we believe, we were praying as a team,

947
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,360
 we believe there's people in the room,

948
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,520
 there's a person in this room tonight,

949
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,780
 and it's your night.

950
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,920
 And you're gonna leave the grave clothes behind

951
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,720
 and come walk in newness of life.

952
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,380
 I did a wedding this past weekend,

953
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:57,380
 and weddings are really interesting moments

954
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,040
 where I'm like the officiant,

955
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,400
 and there's a bride and groom, of course,

956
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,280
 and maybe not for long, bad joke, okay.

957
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,480
 (congregation laughing)

958
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,320
 Okay.

959
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,200
 Man, moment killer.

960
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,880
 And in that, there's like this moment that takes place

961
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,800
 where you pronounce man and wife.

962
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,880
 And in an instant, the two become one.

963
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,940
 Like literally a change the Bible tells us,

964
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,060
 and experientially we see happens

965
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,660
 where the two persons are now one.

966
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,180
 They are no longer two, no longer a single man

967
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,420
 and a single woman, but they've been totally united.

968
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,180
 That's who they are.

969
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,660
 That's reality.

970
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:46,660
 The two have become one, and now they get to experience

971
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:52,060
 all the benefits, all the opportunities

972
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,580
 that come with two becoming one.

973
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,760
 They get to live together, they're sleeping together,

974
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,080
 they have a honeymoon, get excited.

975
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,620
 They have all the benefits that come with those two

976
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:05,000
 because in an instant, they've changed.

977
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,040
 They also get to experience the calling

978
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,080
 that God has for a husband.

979
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,700
 This is what you do as a husband.

980
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,000
 Now you get to not have poker night every night,

981
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,200
 but you now are responsible.

982
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,240
 You have one flesh.

983
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,520
 This is who you are.

984
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,320
 Be the husband who you are.

985
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,920
 It's not be that or else you won't be a husband.

986
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,200
 You are a husband.

987
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,000
 You are one flesh.

988
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,140
 Be who you are.

989
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:32,180
 This is what Paul says changes people.

990
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,120
 Renewing their minds, and it begins by accepting

991
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,440
 who you are.

992
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,640
 Be who you are.

993
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:42,740
 Who it defines you is not your sin struggle,

994
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,720
 not a relationship.

995
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,560
 Be who you are.

996
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,960
 You're not materialistic.

997
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,600
 Even if today you worked out the credit card,

998
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,680
 you're not a porn addict.

999
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,960
 If before the service you were looking at porn,

1000
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,560
 that's not who you are.

1001
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,700
 And the way you can walk in freedom

1002
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,760
 and really experience the reality

1003
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,560
 that that's not who you are if you've trusted in Christ

1004
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,260
 is by renewing your mind.

1005
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:14,080
 By renewing your mind, that's how you're transformed.

1006
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,280
 That's how you become increasingly free

1007
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,200
 to live like who you really are.

1008
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,040
 And that takes place through knowing his word

1009
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,760
 and through having others around us

1010
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,280
 sing his truths and words over us

1011
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,320
 as we take off the old and we put on the new.

1012
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,880
 I'm gonna pray that we do that.

1013
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:38,480
 Father, we need your help to really believe

1014
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,240
 who you say that we are, to trust and to walk in that.

1015
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,800
 I pray tonight that right now,

1016
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,720
 truly shackles will begin to fall off of people.

1017
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,360
 Whether they're shackles of trusting in themselves,

1018
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,440
 trusting in what they've done,

1019
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,640
 and they would trust only in what you have done.

1020
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,480
 But Jesus died on the cross for their sins.

1021
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,320
 I pray that shackles would fall off of sin,

1022
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,480
 of mistaken identity, that minds would,

1023
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,840
 moving forward, continue to be renewed.

1024
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,200
 We pray that people would move out of isolation.

1025
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,920
 Would you renew us?

1026
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,200
 Would we be your people, marked by your qualities?

1027
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:20,200
 Holy, beloved, chosen, yours.

1028
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,240
 Thank you for Jesus.

1029
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,720
 Thank you that you've raised us to walk in newness of life.

1030
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,320
 Would the same perspective Lazarus had

1031
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:35,000
 be one that I have, be one that we have,

1032
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,600
 if we know you, we love you, amen.

1033
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,100
 (music fades)
