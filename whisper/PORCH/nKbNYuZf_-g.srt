00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Ports, how we doing?

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 If we haven't met, my name is JP. It's a privilege to be with you.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 If you're tuning in from somewhere else, Fort Worth, Houston, anywhere around the world,

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 El Paso, listening as you drive, man, we're so glad that you are with us,

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 worshiping, diving into God's word with us this evening.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 And so, if we are friends on social media or anything like that, you know,

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 last week was my son's birthday. So I have a son. He's six years old.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 His name is Weston. He just turned six years old last week.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 And we, last week was his birthday. And so we do birthdays big in our house.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Anybody else do that growing up? Birthdays big? Okay. Good. Like five of you.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And so, he had a party. We went to Nickel Rama. Anybody been there?

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Awesome. It's like an arcade here in Dallas, DFW.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 And it's, you know, it's like a nickel basically is a quarter.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And we're cheap parents, so we went there.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And so, here's what that meant. Every day last week, he'd wake up,

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 "Daddy, it's going to be my birthday." You know? "Daddy, I'm going to have a party."

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I'm like, "Dude, I know. I'm paying for the party."

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 He's like, "You know, the next day, Tuesday, it's my birthday.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 My birthday party's coming up." I'm like, "I know, buddy. I know.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Birthday party's coming up." And then Wednesday, "Hey, my birthday.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 My party's coming up. It's coming up." I'm like, "I know, man. I know."

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 He's like, "Let's go through the invite list again."

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I'm like, "Well, you got your cousins and our friends."

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And anyway, so just every--and then Thursday, "Hey, my party's coming up."

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 You know? And if I'm completely transparent with you,

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 like this idea--he kept saying the same thing, "I can't wait for my party.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 I can't wait for the party."

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 And he's really describing me, like 16 into my young adult years.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Like that's basically how I lived life, whatever was going on.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I can't wait for the party. Like that's who I was.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 It started in high school, you know?

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 It was like whose parents are going to be out of town?

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 We're going over there, right?

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 We'll hang out at your place. And we would do pastor parties.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 That's pasture parties, not pastor parties. Those are different things.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Pastor parties. And so we'd go hang out in high school.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 And then college came around, and it was phone parties,

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 frat parties, sorority parties, who has the function.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And then we'd get the fake IDs, we'd go to the club and the bar.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And it was just like living for the weekend.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 In college, you stretch out the weekend.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 It starts on Thursday night. That was college night.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 That's where the drink specials for the college kids were.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 So we'd go Thursday, Friday, Saturday, right?

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And then I graduated from college, moved to Dallas,

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 and it was just more of this, "I can't wait for the party."

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And I would sit at my desk Monday just thinking,

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 "Can't wait for Friday to get here."

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 And we'd start with the happy hour.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 And then the happy hour, it will turn into evening.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 And then we'll go to this bar. It's kind of pregame.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And then we'll go to this club.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 There's a club on Lower Greenville here in Dallas,

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 like the bar scene. It was the Beagle. It's not there anymore.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And it's just where my heart was.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 I moved five times all within one mile of Lower Greenville.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 And specifically, that place, my friend's sister was a bartender there,

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 so I had this VIP card, which meant you didn't have to wait

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 in all the long lines with those losers.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 You could go around the side door, you know?

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And you didn't have to pay a cover, and the guy would wave you in,

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 and you'd go in like a baller, and you'd have this booth.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And it was just like that. We loved that place.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 It was our country club, if you will.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 You get the bottle service there, the setup there.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And I wasn't a believer, like we don't know each other.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Like I wasn't walking with Christ at this time.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 But I remember the thrill of just thinking,

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 "Man, I don't know what's going to happen."

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 And I look forward to the weekend, and it's like,

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 "Hey, we get some drinks in us.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 "You're dancing on the dance floor.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 "Everybody's hot and sweaty.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 "You're dancing with some girl that you don't know,

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 "and even that's kind of fun and exciting.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 "You don't know where it's going to go.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 "She may go home with me. I may go home with her.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 "I don't know. My friends may get in a fight.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 "I might get in a fight."

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 I just did that thrill of like, "Man, I just don't know.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 "I'm just carefree. I'm young, wild, and free."

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 It's funny because we went back down there,

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 my family and I, we were eating down in Lower Greenville

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 two weeks ago, and just driving through the parking lot,

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 and I'm like, "Oh, yeah, I remember that.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 "We got in a fight there one night."

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 No, that's where I was with my wife,

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 and I was like, "Oh, that's where some girl

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 "tried to pay your brother to take him home."

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And, "Oh, and that's where Travis got so drunk

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 "he jumped up on top of a Porsche.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 "That was not a good night."

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 And just like reliving these memories.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 It was just flooding back to me

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 from a time when I couldn't wait for the party.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And I'm not here to tell you like, "Hey, I'm a pastor now."

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 And I look back and it wasn't fun at all.

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 It was so much fun.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 It was so much fun.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 You know?

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Like I imagine heroin is so much fun.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 I mean, it'll kill you.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 But it's so much fun. It's gotta be right.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 People give their life to it.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And so I'm not here to tell you it wasn't fun.

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 I'm here to tell you maybe it was too much fun.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Maybe it was something like that whole idea

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 of I can't wait for the party.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Like what if I look back on those years

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 and constantly showing up Monday at work

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 and I can't wait for the party.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 See, my whole life was passing me by.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 I wasn't living in the moment.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 I was just looking forward to the next party.

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 The next thrill.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 The next excuse to do something stupid.

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 What if my whole life was passing me by?

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And so we're in Lyrics and Lies, this new series.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 David kicked us off last week talking about you're perfect,

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 just the way that you are.

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 And how that music's selling you that lie.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And the scripture tells you something different.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And tonight, the lie of the music

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 that we grew up listening to

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 is that life is found in the party.

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 It's the whole like drug, sex, and rock and roll, if you will.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Or drug, sex, and rock star status.

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And so I've got some songs I want to play for you.

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 So that's how I was, right?

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 You know, Monday, it's the freaking weekend.

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 I'm about to have me some fun.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And that's why we go there, right?

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 It's like I'm sipping on Coke and rum.

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 So I'm like, so what? I'm drunk.

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Right? I got an excuse now to do everything.

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Like some of you, you know what I'm talking about, right?

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 And some of you, you're like, no, we can't do that.

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 We're in church. Don't even, what are we doing?

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And I know you're so uncomfortable.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And praise God for you.

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 And so the lie, the lie is that life is in the party, right?

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And so the Bible gives us this social experiment

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 with this guy that basically,

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 the reason that the Lord preserved this ancient text

146
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 in Ecclesiastes is there was a man who had everything.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Like he was complete and total rock star status.

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 He had everything that you think you wanted on steroids.

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Times a hundred.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And this is King Solomon.

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And so it's really Ecclesiastes,

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 this one big social experiment where he's just basically saying,

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 hey, I tried this to see if there was life there.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Then I tried this to see if there was life there.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And I tried this to see if there was life there.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 And I think that in the back of our minds, we all think,

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 hey, if we had what Fittie had, right?

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 This is the lie.

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Like, hey, I want to party like a rock star.

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 This is what he's telling.

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 He still, Post Malone's still selling it, right?

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Rock star, right?

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I'm popping pillies, you know?

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 [laughter]

165
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Party like a rock star.

166
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 I mean, you guys know what I'm talking about.

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 It's still the message, right?

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 And the truth is, if you can't wait for the party,

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 if you're living for the party,

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 it's going to leave you despairing.

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 It's going to leave you empty.

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 It's going to leave you depressed.

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 There's nobody that has continued to chase the party

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 and found satisfaction.

175
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 It hasn't happened.

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 In fact, there's this one researcher from Sydney

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 who studied 12,000, rather, 12,665 popular musicians,

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 rock stars, rappers, if you will,

179
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 to see if their lifestyle actually shortened their life.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Because that was the popular belief,

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 does it actually shorten their life?

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 She studied 12,665 of them.

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 This is what she found.

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 The average lifespan of a rock star was shortened

185
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 by 25 years than the general public.

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 The suicide rate among musicians that she studied

187
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 compared to the general population

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 was up to seven times higher,

189
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 700% more likely to commit suicide.

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 The homicide rates among musicians

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 are eight times higher than that

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 among the general U.S. population.

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And so I want to look at how life is not found

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 in sex, drugs, or the rock star status.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 We're looking at King Solomon.

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Post Malone actually wrote "Rock Star" about King Solomon.

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 That was about him.

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 No, I'm lying about that.

199
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 That's not true.

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 He had enough sex to make Hugh Hefner blush, this guy.

201
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 He drank enough wine.

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 In fact, he owned the distillery.

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 He owned the vineyard.

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 He owned the brewery.

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 That's this guy.

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 He wasn't just taking shots of Patron.

207
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 He owned Patron, this guy.

208
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 He had rock star status like Mick Jagger.

209
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 He's the original Kanye, Solomon.

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 He's the O.G. Kanye.

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 That's who we're reading about right here.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And he says this.

213
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 "I said to myself," Ecclesiastes 2, verse one,

214
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 "I said to myself, 'Come now, I will test you

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 "with pleasure to find out what is good.'

216
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 "But that also proved to be meaningless.

217
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 "Laughter, I said, is madness,

218
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 "and what does pleasure accomplish?

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 "I tried cheering myself with wine and embracing folly."

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 And so my first point this evening

221
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 is that life is not found in sex.

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 He talks about pleasure.

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Life is not found in sex.

224
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Fittie says, "I'm into having sex.

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 "I'm into making love, so come give me a hug

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 "if you're into getting rugged."

227
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Ludacris, maybe you heard of him.

228
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 He says, "I want to lick you from your head to your toes,

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 "and I want to move from the bed down to the floor."

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 I think he means floor.

231
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 (congregation laughs)

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Then I want to, yeah, I can't even read that.

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 I'm just gonna stop.

234
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 But he wants to know your fantasy.

235
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 He wants to know your fantasy.

236
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Solomon said, "Come now, and I will test you

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 "with pleasure to find out what is good.

238
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 "But that proved to be meaningless."

239
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 And so the problem with this, right,

240
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 is experiencing pleasure will only leave you

241
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 wanting more pleasure.

242
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Is that not true?

243
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Doesn't it just ratchet up a little bit every time?

244
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Like, you know this.

245
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Experientially, you know this.

246
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Nobody's ever experienced something pleasurable

247
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 and like, "Okay, I'm done.

248
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 "I don't need that for the rest of my life."

249
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 We'll just go tame, like you get a massage maybe.

250
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Like you get a massage, and it's a great massage,

251
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 and you're done, and you're like, "Okay, that's it.

252
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 "I never need another massage for the rest of my life."

253
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Like, that was it, that was the best.

254
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 No, a week later, you're like, "Dude, I gotta go back

255
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 "and get another one," because it just ratchets up.

256
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 It just leaves you wanting more.

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Pornography does the same thing.

258
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 I say it all the time, it's the lie of one last time.

259
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 You just fed something, and it grew,

260
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 and now it's bigger, and it's gonna devour you.

261
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 The club does the same thing.

262
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 You love the thrill, the excitement, the fun of,

263
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 "Hey, I don't know what's gonna happen,"

264
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 and it just leaves you wanting more for the next week,

265
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 and next week, and you have to keep going bigger and better,

266
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 and pretty soon, it's like, "Hey, these clubs here

267
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 "in Houston or in Dallas or around,

268
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 "we need to go to Vegas."

269
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Because what happens in Vegas

270
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 will haunt you the rest of your life, that's the truth.

271
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 (congregation laughing)

272
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 And I want you to know, I say it all the time,

273
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 that sex is good, sex is from God.

274
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 God invented it.

275
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 He made it feel the way it does.

276
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 God inserted pleasure into his invention,

277
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 his creation of sex.

278
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 He did that.

279
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 He put the nerve endings where they are.

280
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 That was God's genius idea, but you need to know

281
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 it will not satisfy you.

282
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 It is not ultimate, and I know you're thinking,

283
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 "Well, that's easy for you to say.

284
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 "You're gonna go home to your wife."

285
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 The reality is, if someone in marriage

286
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 experiences intimacy often, like really, really often,

287
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 that's .625% of their life in marriage.

288
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 So of 100 hours, that's what they're doing

289
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 for a half an hour, right?

290
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 So there's gotta be more to marriage than that.

291
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Nobody's doing more.

292
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 If that's where meaning was,

293
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 then who would have the best marriage?

294
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Like porn stars would have the best marriage.

295
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 We'd be looking at them and say,

296
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 "Hey, we need to follow their lead.

297
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 "They really got this marriage thing down."

298
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 But that's not the way that it works,

299
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 because there's something so much more

300
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 to God's gift of marriage than sex,

301
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 or intimacy through sex.

302
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I can prove it to you, because Solomon,

303
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 he has a harem.

304
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 What a harem is, is a group of women to choose from.

305
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 This is where it gets really weird with this guy.

306
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 But I think this is why Creator God preserved this text.

307
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 See, he has 700 wives.

308
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 He's a polygamist.

309
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 And he has 300 prostitutes.

310
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 They all live with him, and they're all at his disposal.

311
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Here's what that means, is he can sleep with a wife

312
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 two times a day for a year

313
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 without sleeping with the same person.

314
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 And then when he gets bored with wives,

315
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 if he wants to go outside of marriage,

316
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 he has 300 prostitutes at his disposal.

317
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 He's not going to www.

318
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 He's not pulling up on his iPhone.

319
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 He has the live-in pornography

320
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 in three-dimensional image right there in front of him.

321
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 It's crazy.

322
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And you think, "Man, but was he a Christian?

323
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 "Christ didn't come."

324
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Yeah, that's complicated, but here's the deal.

325
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 He didn't know God.

326
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 This was his downfall.

327
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 I believe this is why God shows us this,

328
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 because this is what ruined Solomon.

329
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 This is what led his heart astray.

330
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 He was not obedient to God in the wives that he took,

331
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 even that he had more than one.

332
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 So do you know, like I think we think,

333
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 "Man, if I just had everything I wanted, I'd be happy."

334
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 You know anybody that gets everything they want?

335
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 They're dysfunctional.

336
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Usually they move toward a place of mental illness.

337
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 They can't deal with society.

338
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 They isolate themselves in deep, deep, deep sadness,

339
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 but we don't learn that lesson, do we?

340
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Because you came in this room thinking,

341
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 "If I just had everything I wanted, I would be happy."

342
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Solomon wanted it, he did it, and he said it was meaningless.

343
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 And we can learn something here, that it's empty.

344
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 When we're constantly looking for the next time

345
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 that we can experience pleasure to fulfill us,

346
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 we become literally ill,

347
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 and we start chasing weird pleasures.

348
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And that's why we listen and laugh at things like ludicrous,

349
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 asking us, "What's our fantasy?"

350
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 We're 6'9" right now on the radio.

351
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 And let me tell you what's going to happen,

352
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 because I see it all the time, and I love you.

353
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 I love being here with you guys.

354
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 I'm looking at you, I'm looking in your eyes,

355
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 and I love that God has you here this evening.

356
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 But here's the way this plays out, and I'll just tell you,

357
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 because I get to see hundreds and hundreds

358
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 and hundreds of relationships.

359
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Dude looks at porn, he grows an appetite

360
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 that's not just unholy, it's unhealthy.

361
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 It's not that he wants sex, he wants the craziest kind of sex.

362
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 So he gets in a relationship with a woman,

363
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 he convinces her that he's good husband material.

364
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 They get married, he has expectations of her

365
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 that she will never be able to meet.

366
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 That in fact monogamy will never satisfy him,

367
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 because he's been training himself for variety

368
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 since the fifth grade.

369
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And he's been able to dial up anything he wanted

370
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 just by putting in a web address or a search engine request.

371
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 And those expectations of that woman

372
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 are going to crush her, and women,

373
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 you guys can be complicated beings

374
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 in the way that you think, and you know, guys are simple.

375
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Like we're just kind of, I'll just say first person,

376
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 I'm just kind of dumb, right, like just one A to B,

377
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 like just simple minded, but you guys,

378
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 if something hurts you emotionally, right,

379
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 you're not into it anymore.

380
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 And then that guy begins to abuse you,

381
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 but he doesn't even know that he is.

382
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 He begins to manipulate you with his words,

383
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 and you begin to endure some verbal abuse,

384
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 but he doesn't even know that's happening.

385
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 He's just following what he's fed his heart

386
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 since the fifth grade.

387
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 And I see it all the time.

388
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 And I picked on the guys, but girls,

389
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 you do the same thing.

390
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 So many of you are addicted to pornography.

391
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 You've been feeding your heart unnatural desires.

392
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 It's been growing inside of you.

393
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 And so what happens is girls tend to give sex to get love,

394
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 and guys give love to get sex,

395
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 and it's a really bad exchange

396
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 because the love that you're offering, it's counterfeit.

397
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 It's not real.

398
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 You're like Fiddy.

399
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 He's into having sex.

400
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 He ain't into making love.

401
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 He doesn't even know what love is, guys.

402
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 He'll never experience love.

403
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 He's going to die having never experienced love,

404
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 and that's a really, really, really sad thing.

405
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 And you know what we do?

406
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 We let him teach us.

407
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 We bob our heads to it.

408
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 We let him be our instructor,

409
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 feeding us lies.

410
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Solomon says laughter is madness,

411
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 and what does pleasure accomplish?

412
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 And then he says this, "I tried cheering myself with wine."

413
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Right?

414
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 So now he's moving on to this idea of,

415
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 "Hey, how can I experience pleasure?"

416
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Like he's talking about laughter.

417
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I like laughter.

418
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 I like funny people.

419
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Like if you're funny, let's hang out.

420
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Let's be friends, okay?

421
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Call me up afterwards.

422
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Like I love to hang out with people that make me laugh,

423
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 but when laughter becomes ultimate to you,

424
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 when that joy, your emotions become ultimate to you,

425
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 one, that's a sign of immaturity,

426
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 but when you're chasing the next time

427
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 that you can experience happiness through laughter,

428
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 what you do is you begin to supplement it.

429
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 You want to feel good,

430
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 and so you get high, you smoke something,

431
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 you snort something, you pop something,

432
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 or you drink something,

433
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 and then that becomes a normal part of your life.

434
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And so my second point is,

435
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 life is not found in the next high.

436
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Life is not found in the next high.

437
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 If it is, he says,

438
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 "You can find me in the club, Bottle Full of Bub.

439
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 "Look, Mommy, I got the X if you into taking drugs."

440
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 LMFAO says, "Party Rock is in the house tonight.

441
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 "Woo.

442
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 "Everybody just have a good time.

443
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 "Yeah.

444
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 "And we're gonna make you lose your mind.

445
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 "Everybody just have a good time.

446
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 "One more shot for us, another round.

447
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 "Fill up my cup.

448
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 "We don't mess around."

449
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 I tried cheering myself with wine.

450
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Can I tell you something?

451
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 I like a nice glass of wine.

452
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 True story.

453
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Sometimes, not very often,

454
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 every now and then, in fact, this past weekend,

455
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 my friend had a birthday party,

456
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 and we went over, it was a dinner,

457
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 and they had an expensive bottle of wine

458
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 in the middle of the table.

459
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 I didn't pay for it.

460
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 I don't pay for it.

461
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 But he did.

462
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And so I had a glass.

463
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 And can I tell you something?

464
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 I think it was God-honoring.

465
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Like communion.

466
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Like fellowshipping with other believers.

467
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Celebrating someone's birth.

468
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Having a glass of wine.

469
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 I don't have any problem with you having a glass of wine,

470
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 as long as you know what the Scripture says about it.

471
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 I don't think it's a sin.

472
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 That's not my message.

473
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 That's not what I'm here to tell you.

474
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 But you having three glasses of wine might be a sin.

475
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 You needing a glass of wine might be a sin.

476
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 You ever done that?

477
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 You come home, like, "Oh, rough day.

478
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 "I need a glass of wine."

479
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Oh, you need one?

480
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Really?

481
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Oh, you want to use it?

482
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Oh, you want to alter the way that you feel?

483
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 You want to use that to alter the way that you feel?

484
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 That might be a sin.

485
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 That could be problematic.

486
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Let's talk about that for a minute, right?

487
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And so some of us, we move to this place

488
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 where we don't even realize.

489
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And then people would say,

490
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 "Well, alcohol's not really a big deal for me."

491
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Really?

492
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Then stop.

493
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 "Oh, drinking's not a big deal for me."

494
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Oh, it's not a big deal for you?

495
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Great.

496
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Never do it again.

497
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Because if that's hard, then let's agree.

498
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 It's a big deal for you.

499
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 That matters.

500
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 When something's not a big deal for you,

501
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 you can just say, "Oh, I don't need to do that anymore."

502
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Right?

503
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 "I'm done with that."

504
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 And so I think the why is really important.

505
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 And if you drink for a feeling,

506
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 like if you don't want to go somewhere

507
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 because there's not an open bar there,

508
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 or you want to go there because there is an open bar there.

509
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Like, "Hey, you want to go to this wedding?"

510
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 "I don't know."

511
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 "Is there alcohol?"

512
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 And all of a sudden you're like,

513
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 "No, I don't really want to go."

514
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Like, you might have a problem.

515
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Okay?

516
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 You may need to consider that.

517
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Like, that is something, an act of worship for you.

518
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 And so here's four things that I think are really helpful

519
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 directly from the scripture that you can drink if.

520
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 And so you can write this down.

521
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 You can drink as long as no one is offended by it.

522
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 It's 1 Corinthians chapter 8.

523
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 As long as it doesn't cause anyone to stumble.

524
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 It's Romans 14.

525
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 And so that just means like if somebody's there

526
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 and they're going to get drunk

527
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 or be more inclined to get drunk because you're there,

528
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 then you don't do it.

529
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 If someone's there and they'd be offended by you drinking,

530
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 then don't do it.

531
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Don't even consider it.

532
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 As long as you don't get drunk, that's Ephesians 5:18.

533
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 And as long as you do it for the glory of God.

534
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Again, if you're sitting there, that's 1 Corinthians 10:31.

535
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Whether you eat or drink, whatever you do,

536
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 do it to the glory of God.

537
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 If you can do it to the glory of God, then praise Him.

538
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 But if you can't, don't.

539
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Then don't.

540
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Don't do it.

541
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 And I'm just going to tell you that you going out there

542
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 to drink so that you can do something

543
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 that you wouldn't be courageous enough to do sober,

544
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 that's not you doing it to the glory of God.

545
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 That's problematic.

546
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Stop it.

547
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 It's not God honoring, right?

548
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Can I tell you something?

549
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 It's not an excuse.

550
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 I was drunk is not a good excuse for anything.

551
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Like I don't know when that became okay.

552
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Like all of a sudden your boyfriend cheated on you,

553
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 but it's okay because he was drunk.

554
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 What?

555
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Are you serious?

556
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Like is that what you're going to tell God?

557
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Like God's going to look at you in the face and say,

558
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 "Hey, why didn't you follow me down there?"

559
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 "Oh, man, I was drunk."

560
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Blame it on the alcohol.

561
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 No, no.

562
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 No, that's not going to go well for you.

563
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 That's not going to go well for you.

564
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 It's not an excuse.

565
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 And so let's be honest.

566
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 So many of you get drunk so that you have an excuse

567
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 to do things you don't have enough courage to do

568
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 when you're sober.

569
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Let's learn from Solomon for a minute.

570
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 This dude partied, okay?

571
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Like he partied more than any of you partied.

572
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 That's the truth.

573
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 He would have 15,000 people over for dinner every night.

574
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 One of his parties he invited,

575
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 this is straight from the Scriptures, 1 Kings 4.

576
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 He invites everyone in the kingdom over.

577
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 What he had for dinner that night,

578
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 he served 22,000 cows.

579
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Not 22,000 filets, 22,000 cows.

580
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 This is true, literal story.

581
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Like this actually happened.

582
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 I can't even get my head around that.

583
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 And you say, "Well, why does that matter?

584
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 "Why would we know?"

585
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Just so that God is showing you,

586
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 "Hey, you never partied like this guy."

587
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 And he's telling you it was meaningless.

588
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 It is meaningless.

589
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 And you say, "No, man, you don't understand.

590
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 "We party big, JP, okay?

591
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 "I was the president of my fraternity,

592
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 "and one time we got this keg."

593
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 And Solomon's laughing at you.

594
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 He makes your party, your little foam soiree,

595
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 look like my six-year-old's birthday party, okay?

596
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 And there was no keg there, right?

597
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 It was like community and family and friends.

598
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 And that's what he makes your party look like.

599
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And he's saying, "Hey, it was meaningless.

600
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 "There wasn't life there.

601
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 "It's going to leave you empty."

602
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 And so you drink to try to escape reality,

603
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 but the problem with that is reality

604
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 is still there when you're done.

605
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 And the problem with that, friends,

606
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 is you never learn to deal with reality.

607
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Like, so, okay, he broke your heart.

608
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Now you gotta go get wasted.

609
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Really?

610
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 What if you learn to deal with a broken heart?

611
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Because life is hard.

612
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 And you know what people who get wasted

613
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 to deal with broken hearts do?

614
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 They grow up to be moms who get wasted

615
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 to deal with broken hearts or hard days

616
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 or rough days at school

617
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 or when the kids aren't listening.

618
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 That's what happens.

619
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 That's where it ends up.

620
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Oh, nobody grew up and said,

621
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 "Hey, I really want to be an alcoholic when I grow up."

622
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 But so many people do.

623
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Why?

624
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Because they dealt with the breakup

625
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 with a glass of wine.

626
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Two, three, four.

627
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Oh, you didn't think about that, did you?

628
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Oh, you didn't know that's where that goes.

629
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 That's where that goes.

630
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 That's where it leads to.

631
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Ephesians 5:18 says, "Do not get drunk on wine,

632
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 "which leads to debauchery.

633
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 "Instead, be filled with the Spirit."

634
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 What if you took that breakup

635
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 and you leaned into God

636
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 and you said, "God, my heart's so bad right now.

637
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 "I don't think I'm gonna be able to sleep tonight.

638
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 "I'm not gonna want to get out of bed tomorrow.

639
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 "I hurt so bad.

640
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 "In fact, I'm tempted to go get high.

641
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 "I'm tempted to go get drunk.

642
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 "I'm tempted to go hang out with my friends

643
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 "and do something stupid.

644
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 "God, Holy Spirit, would you help me?"

645
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 What if you did that?

646
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 What does it mean to be filled with the Spirit in context?

647
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 It's like, what does alcohol do?

648
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 It removes your worries.

649
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 It numbs you to life.

650
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 What does the Holy Spirit do?

651
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 When you trust Him, He removes your worries

652
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 and He leads you to life.

653
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I don't know if you guys have seen,

654
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 like this has always played out in movies,

655
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 but like Limitless is one,

656
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 there's a show and a movie,

657
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 but it's like this super drug

658
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 that at first you think there's no consequences to it.

659
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 And what I'm trying to tell you

660
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 is there's always a consequence.

661
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 There's always a hangover.

662
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Life's always waiting for you.

663
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Like, right, you pop X because you want to feel good.

664
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 You do Molly because you want to feel good

665
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 and you don't realize it's draining your brain of serotonin

666
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 and then your brain's not producing enough serotonin

667
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 and it's leaving you depressed

668
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 or putting holes in your brain, right?

669
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 I mean, you like Coke, right?

670
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 People give their entire lives to Coke.

671
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 And I've sat with people right up here

672
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 trying to tell me, "No, but THC, it doesn't have drawbacks."

673
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 And I would just say, "You're a fool.

674
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 "You're a fool.

675
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 "Show me the last person that getting high

676
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 "made them a better follower of Jesus Christ."

677
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Like, "I'd love to meet you.

678
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 "If that's you, I'll be up here afterwards.

679
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 "We can chat."

680
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 He says, "I undertook," verse four,

681
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 "I undertook great projects.

682
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 "I built houses for myself and planted vineyards."

683
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Okay, when he says he built houses for himself,

684
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 like this dude, okay?

685
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Like, here's a picture of his house, okay?

686
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 This is, like, every house that has ever been on MTV Cribs

687
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 could fit in that house, all right?

688
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 That is Solomon's Palace.

689
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 It took 13 years to build it, and you're like,

690
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 "Well, that's just 'cause it was a long time ago."

691
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 No, no, no, it took seven years to build God's house,

692
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 the temple, which was extremely extravagant.

693
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 13 years to build Solomon's Palace.

694
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 When he says he built houses, like, it's next level.

695
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 "I made gardens and parks and planted

696
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 "all kinds of trees in them," okay?

697
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 He's, like, saying, "I got 12-car garage, but only six cars."

698
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 "I made reservoirs to water groves and flourishing trees."

699
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Okay, he made reservoirs.

700
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Can I tell you something?

701
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Like, we got a picture of the reservoirs?

702
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 You know what's crazy about that picture?

703
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 That's taken a day.

704
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 You know what's crazy about this text?

705
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 It was 3,000 years ago.

706
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 His pools are still there.

707
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 It's stamped geographically.

708
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 This man actually lived.

709
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 You can go to secular websites,

710
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 search "the richest man to ever live,"

711
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 and secular websites, which deny the Bible,

712
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 will tell you it's King Solomon

713
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 because his pools are still there.

714
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 You could go to Bethlehem, travel about five miles northeast.

715
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 You're going to see the pools of Solomon's.

716
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 What did he use them for?

717
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 To water his vineyards, right?

718
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 He had vineyards, gardens, like the arboretum,

719
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 like the daddy to the arboretum, right?

720
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 I know you got a succulent you're trying to keep alive.

721
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Dude had vineyards.

722
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Vineyards, this guy.

723
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 "I bought male and female slaves

724
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 "and had other slaves who were born in my house.

725
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 "I also owned more herds and flocks

726
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 "than anyone in Jerusalem before me.

727
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 "I amassed silver and gold for myself

728
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 "and the treasure of kings and provinces.

729
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 "I acquired male and female singers

730
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 "and a harem as well, the delights of a man's heart.

731
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 "I'm looking for satisfaction everywhere,

732
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 "and I'm coming up empty."

733
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 He's the ultimate rock star.

734
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Third point, life is not found in rock star status.

735
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 I know Fittie says, "The party like a rock star."

736
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 We talked about what Post Malone says.

737
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Let me tell you, there's this club called the 27 Club.

738
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Anyone heard of it?

739
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 It's a very exclusive club.

740
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 It's a very famous club,

741
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 but it's not a club that anyone wants to be a member of.

742
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 It is a list of rappers and rock stars

743
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 who have died at the age of 27.

744
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 There's a crazy amount of them.

745
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Mac Miller just missed it by one year at 26.

746
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 Who's on the list?

747
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Amy Winehouse, Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix,

748
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison,

749
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 all died at the age of 27.

750
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Why?

751
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Because they partied like rock stars.

752
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 They did what you think you want to do,

753
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 and it killed them.

754
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Do you see why a loving father would sit up here and say,

755
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 "I want something better for you."

756
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 I know that that's fun.

757
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 I know it's fun.

758
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 It's Satan's fun.

759
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 It's the enemy's fun.

760
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 You're going to get hooked to that kind of fun,

761
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 and you're not going to be able to enjoy normal life.

762
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 You're not going to be able to sit and be content

763
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 at your desk on Monday

764
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 because you're going to be looking forward to the party,

765
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 and you're going to be dysfunctional,

766
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 and you're going to be depressed,

767
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 and you're going to have to take something

768
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 to feed your brain,

769
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 to stabilize the serotonin

770
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 because you're constantly looking for the next party.

771
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 And God's saying, "Hey, I don't want that for you.

772
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 "I want something better for you."

773
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 We all think that if we just had, you know, fill in the blank,

774
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 that we would be happy,

775
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 and none of us are ever going to have more stuff than Solomon,

776
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 and yet he says, "No, it doesn't lead to happiness."

777
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 He had the nice house, the vineyards, the gardens.

778
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 He has 30,000 employees, 30,000 people that work for him,

779
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 and he's not a company.

780
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 That's like the amount of employees Tesla has,

781
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 but he's a person, and they work for him.

782
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 He has herds and flocks.

783
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 He has herds and flocks.

784
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Like, you've got a little Yorkie or a Golden Doodle.

785
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Like, that's cute.

786
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 He's got herds and flocks, this guy, right?

787
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 And he's got singers.

788
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 That's the--you know, that's this time's equivalent to the iTunes.

789
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 So you've got, like, 7,000 songs on your iTunes.

790
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Like, you've got the new Ariana Grande album.

791
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Like, that's cute.

792
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Like, he's got Ariana Grande hanging upside down in his living room,

793
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 like, singing to him.

794
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Like, that's this man.

795
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 He has access to the actual singers.

796
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 He has gold and silver.

797
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Verse 8, "His income is a billion dollars a year."

798
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Not his net worth.

799
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 His income, a billion dollars a year.

800
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 That's $2,000 a minute.

801
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 That's $2,700,000 per day he makes.

802
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 $2 million a day this man makes,

803
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 and he says, "It's meaningless.

804
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 It's empty."

805
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 And maybe you don't want to listen to Solomon.

806
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 Let me give you some other people to listen to.

807
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 You could listen to Brad Pitt.

808
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 He said to Rolling Stone, he said,

809
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 "Man, I know all these things are supposed to seem important to us--

810
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 the car, the condo, our version of success.

811
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 But if that's the case, why is the general feeling out there

812
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 reflecting more impotence and isolation and desperation and loneliness?

813
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 If you ask me, I say, 'Toss all this.

814
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 We've got to find something else.'"

815
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 I don't have those answers yet.

816
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 The emphasis now is on success and personal gain.

817
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 I'm sitting in it, and I'm telling you that's not it.

818
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 I'm the guy who's got everything I know,

819
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 but I'm telling you once you've got everything,

820
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 then you're just left with yourself.

821
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 I've said it before, and I'll say it again.

822
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 It doesn't help you sleep any better,

823
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 and you're not any better when you wake up because of it.

824
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 This is Brad Pitt, says Tom Brady, 2009, in a 60-minute interview.

825
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 He has five Super Bowl rings, four-time Super Bowl MVP.

826
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 He's married to a Victoria's Secret model,

827
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 and he says, "There's got to be something more.

828
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 This isn't it. This isn't where life is found.

829
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 There's got to be something else."

830
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Russell Brand said, "You can't make yourself happy

831
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 with the acquisition of material objects

832
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 or even through romance or anything."

833
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Jim Carrey said, "Everybody should get rich and famous

834
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 and do everything they ever dreamed of

835
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 so that they can see that it's not the answer."

836
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 See, those people, they're infinitely better off than you are,

837
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 not because of what they have,

838
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 but because they know it won't bring happiness.

839
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 We still sit in a place where we don't have it,

840
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 and we think we're going to work hard tomorrow for it,

841
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 and we can't wait for the party this weekend.

842
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 They're saying, "Hey, man, that's not it. That's not it."

843
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 There was a club on Lower Greenville called the Sugar Shack.

844
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 Anybody remember the Sugar Shack?

845
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 No. Good.

846
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 And so it was there. It was kind of the hot spot.

847
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 And this one particular night, you know, it's full,

848
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 like, pass-fire code. Everybody's in there.

849
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 There's a DJ in there.

850
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Everybody's drinking, dancing, jumping up and down,

851
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 jamming to the DJ.

852
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 And what happened is the floor fell out.

853
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 It caved in. People got hurt, like, fell from the second floor.

854
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 And it was kind of when God was doing a work in my heart,

855
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 and it ministered to me, because I thought, you know,

856
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 that's what we're doing is we're, like, partying, we're dancing,

857
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 we're numbing ourselves, we're listening to songs.

858
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 We're not even understanding what the words that were feeding our heart

859
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 are actually saying.

860
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 And it's like the door, the trap door is just going to fall out.

861
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 Like, we're going to dance all the way off the cliff.

862
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 We're going to party all the way to hell.

863
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 And God's going to be like, why'd you do that?

864
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 I don't know, God, I was drunk.

865
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 I was, why didn't you pursue me?

866
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 It was fun.

867
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 So life's not found in sex.

868
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 Life's not found in the next high.

869
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Life's not found in being a rock star.

870
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 It's crazy because my story is I was at the Beagle 17 years ago.

871
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 I was there.

872
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 I was upstairs in this club, the one where I had the VIP car to,

873
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 and I bumped into a friend from college.

874
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 And I said, what are you doing this weekend?

875
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 And she said, I'm going to go check out this church.

876
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 I said, great, pick me up.

877
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 She did.

878
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 And I went in and I sat in the back row.

879
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 And I just began to wrestle with, all right, I've always said I believed in God.

880
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 But the truth is I've always done what I wanted to do.

881
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 I slept with whoever I wanted to sleep with.

882
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 I drank whatever I wanted to drink.

883
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 I snorted whatever I wanted to snort.

884
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 I smoked whatever I wanted to smoke.

885
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 I've never worshipped this God.

886
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 I've always called myself a Christian.

887
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 But I had to come to this place where I realized you're not a Christian.

888
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 You can say you're a Christian, but you're not a Christian.

889
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 You're not doing anything Christian.

890
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 You're just saying you're a Christian.

891
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 And I said, all right, well, who is God?

892
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 And I began to wrestle with it.

893
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 I began to research it.

894
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Is it the Hindu God, the Buddhist God, the Jewish God, the Islamic God?

895
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 I kept tripping over the character of Jesus Christ.

896
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 And the beautiful news of the gospel that I don't have to pay for my sins because

897
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 Jesus paid for my sins on the cross.

898
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 And that he died for my sins and that God raised him from the grave.

899
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 What Solomon is trying to tell you, friends, something really important,

900
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 nothing in this life is going--nothing in this world is going to satisfy you.

901
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 And if nothing in this world is going to satisfy you, he says specifically,

902
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 nothing under the sun.

903
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 If nothing under the sun is going to satisfy you, you have to go beyond the sun.

904
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 There has to be something else out there.

905
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 And can I tell you, you've got to hear me on this.

906
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 You've got to hear me.

907
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Wherever you're at, you've got to hear me on this.

908
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 It is time right now, today, tonight, for you to begin to pursue God with

909
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 reckless abandonment.

910
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 He is the only thing.

911
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 It says in Ecclesiastes 3, God has set eternity in our heart.

912
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 You have a void, an eternal hole in your heart that only God can fill.

913
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 And if you chase the things of this world, you're going to end up empty.

914
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 You're going to end up empty.

915
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 He said, verse 24, "A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and

916
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 find satisfaction in their own toil.

917
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 This, too, I see is meaningless," or "This, too, I see is from the hand of God,"

918
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 rather.

919
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 "This, too, I see is from the hand of God.

920
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 For without him, who can eat and find enjoyment?

921
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness.

922
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 But to the sinner, he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand

923
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 it over to the one who pleases God.

924
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 This, too, is meaningless, a chasing after the wind."

925
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 He's saying, "Hey, Fiddy can gather all my stuff, and Cardi B, and Nicki Minaj,

926
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 and 6ix9ine.

927
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 They can gather up all my stuff.

928
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 And you know what's going to happen?

929
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 They're just going to hand it to the righteous, those that are going to be with

930
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 me in my kingdom forever and ever and ever.

931
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 They can collect it here in their little 76 years or 27 years, whatever they have.

932
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 26 years for some.

933
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 They're going to collect it, and then they're just going to hand it to my

934
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 children to enjoy with me forever.

935
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 See, I told you tonight that the lie is that life is in the party.

936
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 But the truth is that life is in the party.

937
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 And you know, the only party I know of that's bigger than the ones that Solomon

938
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 went through is the one that is going to happen with Jesus in his presence.

939
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 It's a party.

940
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 This is the metaphor that we see in the scripture.

941
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 It's a party.

942
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 In Isaiah 25, it says there's going to be drinking and feasting.

943
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 The best wine you've ever had.

944
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 It says vintage.

945
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 Can you imagine vintage with God?

946
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 Like this is next-level vintage.

947
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 But it's from the Bible.

948
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 And it says there's music and dancing there, Luke 15.

949
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 It says there's passion there, worship, Revelation 14.

950
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 There's lots of people, but like it's friendships without flakiness or hurts.

951
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 It's just like true love.

952
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 Like you see them across the room on the dance floor, and it's not weird.

953
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 Like, hey, he hit on my man or anything like that.

954
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 It's like, oh, like how are you doing?

955
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 Like I missed you.

956
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 And it's a reunion, like one you've never seen.

957
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 This is for Thessalonians 4.

958
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 Like your grandma, your grandpa, your great-grandparents, the ones that have

959
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 gone before you, your parents, siblings, like you're all there together, the

960
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 family of God.

961
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 And it's this party, this forever kind of party, pure, unadulterated joy, a joy

962
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 you've never experienced candidly, the purest kind of joy, like the most free

963
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 anyone could be, no shame, no hurt, no sadness.

964
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 It's a party.

965
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 Live for that party.

966
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 Like you go to bed tonight, you wake up tomorrow, you say, I can't wait for that

967
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 party.

968
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 How can I live for that party?

969
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 And it starts today.

970
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 You don't have to wait to be there, to live, you know, filled with the Spirit,

971
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 holding this world loosely, knowing you're going to be with God forever, that

972
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 that's all that matters.

973
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 What else is going to matter 100 years from now?

974
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 How many shots you took, if you had sex or not, who you had sex with, what you

975
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 did, how much fun you had.

976
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 100 years from now, what's going to matter?

977
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 You know?

978
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 Live for that party.

979
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 Let me pray that you would.

980
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 And Father, would you help us do that?

981
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 It's so easy to get trapped by the worries of this world.

982
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 You know that.

983
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 You tell us not to.

984
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 And Father, you're such a good God to us.

985
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 You're such a good dad to us.

986
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 It says in your word that you desire to give good gifts to your children.

987
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 Father, would you give those good gifts tonight?

988
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 I pray that you would show us that we've been worldly tonight, that you would

989
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 convict us of sin tonight, that you would show us where life is found.

990
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 Jesus, your son, he came -- said he came that we might have life and have it to

991
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 the fullest.

992
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 Would you help us to experience the fullest life that we could have in him?

993
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 Father, would you show us that now as we sing to you?

994
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 Would you stir our hearts' affections for you, God?

995
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,320
 It's in Jesus' name, amen.

996
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:08,320
