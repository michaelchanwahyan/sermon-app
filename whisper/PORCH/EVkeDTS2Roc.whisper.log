[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.540]   All right.
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.880]   Welcome, everybody, to the porch.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.440]   How you doing?
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.940]   Good.
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.440]   Good.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.320]   Sounds like a lot of new people here tonight.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.600]   That's exciting.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.400]   Introduce myself.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.520]   My name is JP.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.240]   I'm Jonathan Picluda.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.800]   Glad to be here with you guys.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.720]   Glad you could finally make it.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.040]   I'm kidding.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.740]   My name's Adam.
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.080]   I get to lead the college ministry here
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.580]   at Watermark.
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.480]   Any college students here tonight?
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.980]   All right.
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.920]   Couple of Aggies doing their whoop thing, whatever.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.360]   All right.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.040]   That's awesome.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.960]   Well, I'm excited you guys are here.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.280]   Here's what we're doing at the porch this summer.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   We're doing this thing called Summer on the Mount,
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.160]   where we're going through the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus'
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.440]   most famous sermon.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.840]   It's recorded in Matthew chapter 5, chapter 6, and chapter 7.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.680]   And so I'm here tonight, and we are going to pick this up.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.260]   Where we left off last week, tonight
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.440]   is the fifth week with all of this.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.440]   And so that's where we're going to go tonight.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.800]   So before I get started, I got a story I want to start with.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.480]   How many people in here, just by show of hands real quick,
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.120]   rent an apartment right now?
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.480]   How many of you guys are renters?
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.360]   Large majority.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.080]   God bless you.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.640]   OK.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.720]   How many of you, though, rent a house?
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.920]   How many of you rent a house?
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.240]   That is the way to go.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.920]   All right.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.720]   I want to tell you a story about a time
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.400]   when my wife and I were renting a house.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.720]   It was 2010.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.880]   It was late summer of 2010.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.600]   We were renting a house up in Richardson,
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.640]   just a little couple miles north here of Watermark.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.680]   We had this great house in a great neighborhood.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.720]   We loved it.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.920]   And at this time, we had two kids in our life.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.240]   We had-- our oldest was like a little over two,
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.240]   and our youngest had just been born.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.720]   Jake and Joshua had just been born.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.360]   Joshua had just been born at that point.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.720]   And so our lease was coming up.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.640]   We were about two months away from the lease being up.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.440]   We had been in this house for about a year.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.480]   And so the landlord gives me a call.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.960]   And he was a friend of ours, and we
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.880]   were renting just from an individual owner.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.320]   And he gives me a call, says, hey, Adam,
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.480]   your lease is coming up in about 60 days.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.240]   And if you're going to move out, I need to have 60 days notice.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.800]   And so I don't know if you and your wife
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.920]   have talked about it or not, but I
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.480]   need to know if you guys are going to sign the lease again.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.560]   And I just right there on the phone
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.040]   was like, I'm going to sign the lease again.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.840]   We love this house.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.640]   We love the location.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.720]   We love the neighborhood.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.440]   We love the cost.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.320]   We love all of it.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.920]   We will sign the lease.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.440]   We want to stay here another year.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.320]   He says, great.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.160]   So here's what I'm going to do.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.920]   I'm going to drop off a new lease.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.280]   I'll drop it off in your mailbox.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.560]   When your rent's due in a couple of weeks,
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.240]   you just go ahead and sign that lease.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.600]   You and your wife sign the lease,
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.040]   include that with your rent check, and we'll be fine.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.800]   I said, great.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.640]   That's what we'll do.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.440]   A couple of days later, the lease shows up.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.280]   A couple of days after that, we get a phone call.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.000]   And to make a long story short, the contents
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.400]   of this phone call really changed our life.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.120]   We got a phone call, and basically my wife and I
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.120]   had an opportunity to buy a house.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.280]   Up to this point, we'd been married about seven years.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.200]   We had just been renting, and we had this amazing opportunity,
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   something you couldn't plan for, something
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.640]   we weren't planning for.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.920]   Everything kind of aligned, and we had an opportunity
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.600]   to buy the house.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.440]   And so Jackie's like, this is amazing.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.600]   Like, we're going to have an opportunity to buy a house.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.480]   Aren't you excited?
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.560]   And I'm like, yeah, I'm excited, but I don't know
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.360]   what we're going to do, because I just told the landlord
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.920]   that we're going to sign the lease.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.120]   And she sits there and goes, well, hold on.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.120]   Did you actually sign it?
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.480]   I said, no, we haven't signed it.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.400]   It's sitting right over there on the table.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.560]   She goes, well, if you haven't signed it,
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.680]   then we're not bound.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.040]   Here's one thing you need to know about my wife.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.160]   When she used to be a lawyer.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.840]   So in these areas, I tend to trust her.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.800]   I tend to go, hey, you're the expert.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.240]   And so she put that little lawyer hat on,
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.920]   and she's looking at this going, no, no, no, no.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.960]   If you just told somebody you're going to sign it,
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.840]   that doesn't obligate you.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.520]   It obligates you when you sign it.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.760]   That's when you're obligated.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.120]   And I said, that sounds amazing.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.040]   Let's go with that, because you're an attorney.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.720]   And so here's what I did.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.240]   I wrote out a letter.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.480]   I wrote a letter to the landlord.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.520]   I said, hey, I know I told you I would sign it,
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.560]   but we had this awesome opportunity that popped up,
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.520]   and now we're going to go try to buy this house.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.920]   And so I'm not signing the lease.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.440]   Love, Adam.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.040]   And I put that, and I wrote this letter.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.800]   I signed it.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.600]   I folded it up.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.840]   I put it in an envelope.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.880]   I took the lease, unsigned, put that in the envelope.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.560]   I took my rent check, put that in the envelope,
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.800]   put all three of them in the envelope,
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.000]   get in my car to go drive over to his house to pay the rent,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.120]   because that's the way we did it.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.880]   I would drive over and drop it in his mailbox.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.880]   And guys, I'm telling you, I will never forget.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.880]   I pull up in front of his house, and he is out front.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.920]   Now, he was on the phone, and so I was like,
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.400]   all right, all right, that's good.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.440]   But when I saw him, I was like, my heart sunk.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.320]   I was like, oh no.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.360]   And so he's on the phone, and he's like getting in his car,
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.880]   and I kind of get out of my car,
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.960]   and I'm like waving this little envelope,
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.560]   like, hey, I got your rent check, you know?
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.520]   And I'll never forget, he goes like this.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.840]   He's on the phone, and he goes, hold on.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.640]   And he looks at me, and he goes, is the lease in there?
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.000]   And guys, I panicked.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.600]   I looked at him, I go, yeah, it's in there.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.720]   'Cause technically it was.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.720]   I mean, it was in there.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.160]   So again, legally, I was fine.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.000]   I was not lying.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.880]   I mean, it was there.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.520]   And so technically it was in there.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.520]   I knew what he was asking.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.000]   What he was asking is, is the signed lease in there?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.760]   But I just was like playing the technicality,
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.160]   and I said, yeah, the lease is in there.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.320]   So I drop it off to him, and he goes,
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.280]   great, I'll call you later.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.320]   And I'm like, I know you will.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.760]   And so I get back in my car, and I go on,
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.160]   and then a couple hours later, the phone rings,
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.000]   and I look, and it's the landlord, and I pick it up,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.840]   and I'm like, hello.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.640]   And he goes, you told me you were gonna sign the lease.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.000]   And I'm like, yeah, but these circumstances changed.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.160]   I mean, I couldn't plan for this.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.280]   And he's like, but you said you were going to sign the lease.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.560]   This is confusing to me.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.800]   This is frustrating to me.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.560]   I don't understand why you said you were gonna do something,
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.080]   and now you're not doing it.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.680]   He kept saying that over and over and over again.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.800]   And I'm thinking probably what you're thinking.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.480]   I'm like, man, that's kind of harsh.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.520]   Like, how about a, hey, congratulations?
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.560]   Or hey, maybe I'll get you a housewarming gift
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.400]   or something like that.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.440]   Like, aren't you excited that my wife and I
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.400]   don't have to rent anymore,
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.800]   that we're gonna get a chance to buy a house?
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.600]   He was not excited.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.040]   He was frustrated.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.640]   He was confused.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.600]   And he kept saying over and over and over again,
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.240]   you told me you were gonna sign the lease,
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.400]   and he was right.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.640]   And my wife and I learned something,
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.680]   and it was, when I say learned something,
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.320]   I mean, really, we were reminded of something
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.360]   that we had learned over and over and over again
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.880]   in our life, but yet we were seeing it anew
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.040]   with that situation.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.320]   I mean, that whole situation was not one of
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.440]   my finest moments or my wife's finest moments.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.320]   We look at that.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.720]   In fact, I even told her that I was gonna open
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.440]   with that kind of story, or with this story,
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.280]   we were gonna talk about this,
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.880]   and she kind of had that cringe look.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.120]   And both of us, when we think about that situation
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.760]   and what we did with that landlord,
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.000]   we both, we kind of, we just cringe sometimes
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.160]   'cause we know that was not one of the best moments
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.000]   in our life.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.120]   And we learned something again that night,
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.120]   and what we learned is that our word matters.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.680]   When we say we're going to do something that matters,
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.760]   and the reason why it matters is because when we say
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.200]   we're gonna do something, we're making a commitment.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.040]   And the way that we handle our commitment
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.280]   reveals our character.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.040]   And I start with all that tonight because that's,
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.560]   that's what we're gonna talk about tonight.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.560]   The subject matter of our discussion tonight is commitments.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.720]   And all the commitments that you and I make
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.920]   as we go on about interacting in our lives
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.040]   and in our daily lives,
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.520]   we're always and often making commitments,
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.720]   and we're gonna look specifically at what Jesus has to say
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.520]   about the commitments that we make in our life.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.040]   And there's two reasons why this is so vitally important
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.280]   for every single one of us in the room tonight,
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.120]   and here's the first reason.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.760]   The first reason this message is so important for us
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.880]   and what Jesus has to say about commitments
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.520]   is so important for us is because this,
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.040]   by and large, one of the reputations
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.840]   that 20 and 30-somethings have out there,
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.440]   one of the reputations that people in their 20s and 30s has
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.160]   is that they are flaky.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.080]   You're flaky.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.120]   Life, you're just flying by the seat of your pants.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.360]   You're just doing whatever it is that you wanna do.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.160]   You wanna keep all of your options open
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.680]   to make sure you don't miss out on anything.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.560]   Like FOMO is not just a funny hashtag
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.480]   or something that you say before you go do something crazy.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.640]   FOMO is a way of life for so many people
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.760]   in their 20s and 30s, which is basically,
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.320]   I wanna do what I wanna do,
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.520]   and I wanna keep all of my options open
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.240]   because I wanna make sure that I don't miss out on anything.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.520]   I mean, let's be real honest.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.640]   There's a lot of you in the room tonight
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.520]   because nobody else called you today.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.960]   There's a lot of you that would not be in the room tonight
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.800]   had he called or had she called
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.200]   or had any other human being called you
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.040]   to ask you to do something tonight.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.920]   You wouldn't be here tonight.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.280]   So by and large, the reputation that's out there,
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.920]   20s and 30-somethings, is that they're flaky,
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.920]   and here's what we're gonna see tonight, guys.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.040]   Jesus is not okay with that.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.320]   He's not okay with that.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.360]   The second reason why this is such an important message
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.720]   for all of us in the room tonight
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.880]   is because with every single commitment that we make,
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.400]   with every interaction that we have with people,
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.960]   what's at stake is not just our calendars.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.800]   What's at stake is our character.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.520]   Every interaction that we have,
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.320]   every commitment that we make,
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.960]   every time we tell somebody, "I'm going to do that,"
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.600]   or, "I'm gonna be there then," or, "I will call you,"
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.520]   or, "I will do that," every single commitment that we make,
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.720]   we are doing one of two things with our character.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.600]   We are either building trust or we are eroding trust.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.680]   We are either gaining credibility
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.360]   or we're losing credibility.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.640]   We are either strengthening our reputation
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.400]   or we're weakening our reputation.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:34.360]   Every one of those interactions reveals something
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.320]   about our character, and here's what's so scary
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.160]   about being flaky, is that if you're flaky
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.760]   or if I'm flaky, we're the last ones to know.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:52.800]   Everybody else knows that we struggle with being flaky.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.160]   Everybody else knows that we struggle keeping our word.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.360]   Everybody, it's blatantly obvious to everybody in our life,
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.480]   and we are often the last one to know.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.440]   That's what makes all of this so scary
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.960]   and why all of this is so important for us tonight.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.760]   And so tonight, what we're gonna do
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.040]   is we're gonna hear what Jesus has to say
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.360]   about the commitments that we make.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.240]   And so here's the message tonight.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.600]   It's got three points as we look at this next section
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.520]   in the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.960]   Matthew chapter five, verses 33 through 37.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.560]   We're gonna draw three points out of this tonight.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.840]   Number one, what we're gonna see
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.240]   is that every single one of us
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.120]   struggles with keeping commitments.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.560]   Number two, we're gonna see
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.520]   that we come up with solutions sometimes.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.080]   We come up with these soft commitments,
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.920]   and when we come up with these soft commitments,
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.160]   they don't help us, they actually condemn us.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.320]   That's what we're gonna see second.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.680]   And then the third thing that we're gonna see
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.040]   is that Jesus, Jesus has a solution,
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:51.200]   and his solution is for you and I to simply commit.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.880]   And so let's open up our Bibles tonight
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.360]   and let's read Matthew chapter five, verses 33 through 37.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.360]   And so this section of the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.280]   what Jesus is doing is he is going through,
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.360]   it started a couple weeks ago
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.840]   when JP talked about anger and conflict
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.800]   and what happens when we get into conflict with one another
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.200]   and we need to reconcile with one another.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.640]   That started this section in the Sermon on the Mount
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.360]   where what Jesus is doing is he is taking popular things
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.880]   that the Pharisees,
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.480]   the Pharisees are these religious professionals of the day.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.280]   These were the ones who were leading
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.480]   the religious community.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.640]   They were the ones responsible for teaching Jesus's,
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.680]   or excuse me, responsible for teaching God's word.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.000]   The Pharisees had been teaching things,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.840]   and they had been living a certain way,
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.760]   and it was not necessarily lining up
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.560]   with the original intent of Scripture.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.760]   And so Jesus in this section in Matthew chapter five
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.040]   starts saying, "Hey, you've heard that it was said,
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.880]   "but I say, you heard that it was said, but I say,
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.560]   "you heard that it was said, but I say."
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.880]   And last week we looked at what David,
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.040]   when he was here, looked at the commitment of marriage
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.320]   and ended in verse 35, or excuse me, verse 32,
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.680]   and here's where we go in verse 33.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.520]   Here's what Jesus says,
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.720]   "Again, you've heard that it was said
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.000]   "to the people long ago,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.640]   "do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.240]   "the vows you have made.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.120]   "But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all,
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.960]   "either by heaven, for it's God's throne,
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.760]   "or by earth, for it's his footstool,
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.360]   "or by Jerusalem, for it's the city of the great king.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.640]   "And do not swear by your head,
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.960]   "for you cannot even make one hair white or black."
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.680]   All you need to say is simply yes or no.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:33.640]   Anything beyond this comes from the evil one.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.440]   So point number one tonight is that we all struggle
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.160]   with commitment, we all struggle with commitment.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.360]   I find it really, you know, it's interesting
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.640]   that right after Jesus talked about the commitment
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.480]   of marriage, that he goes in and he reminds the audience
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.840]   of what God's word says about keeping our word.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.280]   And so when he starts off here in verse 33,
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.360]   "Again, you've heard that it was said
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.200]   "to the people long ago,
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.000]   "do not break your oath,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.360]   "but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made."
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.760]   I mean, this is not a specific quotation
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.320]   from any one verse in the Old Testament.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.640]   But it is absolutely a theme that runs all throughout
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.080]   the Old Testament, in fact, Jesus here is most likely
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.200]   summarizing a verse that you can find in Leviticus,
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.000]   in Deuteronomy, and Numbers.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.760]   All of which saying the same thing.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.360]   God wants you and I to keep our word.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.200]   He wants us to keep our commitments.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.640]   And so why would Jesus start this section with that?
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:36.040]   Why would God include in his commands
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.880]   that he wants you and I to keep our word?
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.440]   Why is it there?
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.440]   The reason that it's there is so simple.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.000]   The reason that it's there is because every single
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.120]   one of us struggles with this.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.960]   Everybody in the room tonight, at some point in our life,
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.680]   we are guilty of breaking our word.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.440]   We told somebody we were going to do something
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.120]   and we did not do it.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.520]   We told somebody we were gonna be somewhere
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.640]   and we did not show up.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.840]   What do you call somebody who says they're going
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.200]   to do something and they don't do it?
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.160]   What do you call somebody who breaks their commitment?
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.400]   That person is what?
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.400]   A liar.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.920]   A liar.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:28.640]   And Jesus is saying, hey, that's not okay.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.640]   That is not okay to be a liar.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.600]   And so we know that we all do this.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.760]   It's not anything that our parents taught us.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.960]   Like I'm sure your parents never sat you down and said,
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.880]   hey, here's just like a little tip for life.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.480]   If something's not going your way,
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.720]   or if you get caught doing something,
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.960]   just say the opposite of what's true.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.600]   Just do that, you know, just tell a lie.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.920]   Like nobody's parents sat down and taught them
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.760]   how to do this.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.680]   It's just something that just came with all of us.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.880]   It's just there.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.680]   It's like the clock app on your iPhone.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.520]   It just comes with the phone.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.440]   You didn't have to load it.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.400]   It's just there.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.000]   And that this ability and this tendency for us to lie,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.920]   it's just there, it's just in us.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.400]   And we know that it's there.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.920]   And so what we try to do sometimes,
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.640]   we try to work around it.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.640]   We try to come up with these solutions.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.400]   And so we try to come up with all these like,
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.080]   quasi commitments, like kind of committing,
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.480]   but not really committing.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.480]   I mean, who hasn't had a conversation,
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.160]   something like this.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.120]   So let's imagine this text message conversation.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.920]   So let's imagine that I'm texting with my friend Daniel.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.840]   And so I text him, I said, "Hey man, you know, Ant-Man,
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.120]   "next Friday, 9.30 at North Park, you in?"
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:46.160]   Daniel texts, "Ooh, probs."
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:56.240]   Anybody, yeah, that means probably.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.600]   These text speak stuff.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.160]   Okay, so anyway.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.960]   So then I text him back, "Sweet, I'm on Fandango right now.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.600]   "You want me to buy two tix and you can pay me back?"
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.840]   Wait for him to text back and he texts back,
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.640]   "Yeah, most likely, fist bump."
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.600]   Right back, okay.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.120]   So should I buy two?
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.720]   I should buy two or I shouldn't?
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.000]   Wait.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.880]   I think you could probably get two.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.880]   Write him back.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.040]   "Help me out, bro, is that a yes or a no?
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.080]   "'Cause I'm not getting all your little speak here
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.960]   "right now, okay?"
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.360]   So I sit there, text that, and then what happens?
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.920]   All right, he's thinking about it.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.520]   Then what happens?
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.360]   Ah.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.320]   But then what happens?
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.840]   It comes back, all right, maybe.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.560]   But then what happens?
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.400]   Ah.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.200]   And I gotta go to Ant-Man by myself.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.840]   It's just weird to go and do that.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.040]   I mean, we all do this, man.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.840]   We know we've got this problem.
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.120]   We know we've got this problem,
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.640]   and so we come up with these solutions.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.080]   We try to soften our commitments.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.440]   And what Jesus is reminding us is,
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.120]   hey, when you say you're gonna do something,
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.400]   do it, be clear.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.800]   If you don't keep your commitments, you're a liar.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.680]   If you don't keep your commitments,
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.800]   you're damaging your reputation.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.760]   You're not building it, you're not strengthening it,
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.560]   you're eroding it.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.000]   Our solution, it's insufficient.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.160]   So point one, we all struggle with this.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.680]   And then look where he goes next, point two.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.240]   These soft commitments that we make, they condemn us.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.880]   And so what we know about the Pharisees,
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.080]   these religious professionals,
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.880]   is that there seems to be this indication
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.680]   that they knew too that they were lying.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.440]   They knew too that they were liars.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.760]   They knew that they struggled to keep their commitments.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.000]   But they also knew that there were times
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.600]   where they really were telling the truth.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.400]   And so for those times where they were telling the truth,
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.840]   what they decided to do was,
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.760]   hey, when we're really telling the truth,
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.840]   we need to somehow call on some sort of outside source
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.480]   to bring some validation to our words.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.560]   And so what the Pharisees had done is they developed
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.640]   what they thought was this great system,
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.160]   this great solution where they created this complex system
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.360]   of oaths and swearing.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.040]   And swearing not like cuss words,
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.120]   like swearing like I swear to God,
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.080]   I'm really gonna do that, or I swear to God,
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.640]   I'm telling the truth right now.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.440]   But they also understood that if they swore to God
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.520]   and then didn't follow through,
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.600]   that not only would that look bad on their character,
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.680]   it'd also look bad on God's character.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.200]   And so they seemed to understand this,
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.160]   and so they developed this complex system
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.920]   and their calling on all of these things,
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.200]   but they decided, hey, let's leave God out of it.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.600]   So when we're really telling the truth,
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.760]   let's do something like, let's swear to heaven,
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.800]   or let's swear to earth,
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.480]   or let's swear to the city of Jerusalem,
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.120]   or I know that if we wanna leave all of those things out,
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.520]   let's just swear by the hairs on our head.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.080]   And Jesus is going, no, listen, that system does not work.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.440]   That's not the solution.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.160]   Look at what he says here, verse 34.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.640]   "But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all."
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.840]   Don't try to call on these things from outside
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.680]   to bring validity to your statements.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.480]   Either by heaven, because that's God's throne,
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.800]   or by earth, 'cause that's his footstool,
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.720]   or by Jerusalem, for it's the city of the great king,
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.000]   and don't swear by your head,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.760]   for you can't even make one hair white or black.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.960]   What the Pharisees thought they could do
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.640]   is if they kept God out of it,
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.740]   if they swore by all these other things,
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.200]   that maybe, maybe they were hiding their words from God.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.080]   And Jesus is going, that's ridiculous.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:54.920]   Heaven?
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.600]   Like, that's God's throne, he's there.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.280]   Earth?
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.920]   That's his footstool, he's there.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.660]   Jerusalem?
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.540]   That's the city of the great king, he's there.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.240]   Oh, you think you own your head?
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:14.280]   You can't even change the color of your hair.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.280]   What makes you think that somehow that is hiding from God?
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:24.080]   And there's this part of me that looks at this
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.880]   that wants to like cross my arms
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.920]   and just kind of shake my head at those Pharisees
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.360]   and go, man, they're so ridiculous.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.800]   Did they really think, did they really think
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.260]   that they were gonna be able to hide from God?
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.600]   Did they really think if they developed a system of oaths
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.480]   to try to bring some validation to their statements
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.740]   that somehow people were gonna start to believe them
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:44.580]   because of that?
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.160]   I wanna sit there and I wanna point a finger
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.520]   and I wanna shake a head at them
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.140]   and then I just realize, you know what?
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.240]   We do the exact same thing.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.800]   I mean, tell me, how many of us in this room tonight
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.800]   haven't heard these words or used these words
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.760]   at some point in our interactions with others?
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:10.240]   We too, we've developed this complex system of oaths
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.700]   where we, or swearing, where we try to call
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.840]   on outside sources to bring validity to our statements
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.420]   when we're really telling the truth.
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.260]   I mean, who hasn't said something like this
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.380]   or started a sentence like this?
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:22.220]   No lie.
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:25.840]   No lie.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.700]   Tony Romo, he was at BuzzBrues last night, I saw him.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:29.540]   No lie.
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:33.360]   You sit there and you hear that and you go, no lie?
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.620]   Like, that's not helping, dude.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.660]   Does that mean everything else you say is a lie?
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.220]   But right now is no lie?
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.000]   So I can trust about 19% of what you say
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:44.840]   is what you're saying.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.020]   You always gotta have that no lie.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.860]   Or says this, who puts this out there?
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:49.700]   Seriously.
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:55.940]   Seriously, the best meal I've ever had right there.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.780]   Seriously.
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.180]   Or who has this one?
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.280]   In this one we say very deliberately,
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.460]   I am not even kidding.
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:08.300]   If she posts another picture of her dog
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.860]   on Instagram, I'm not only unfollowing her on Instagram,
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.340]   I'm unfollowing her in life.
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.340]   Like, that's it, I'm done.
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.020]   If I see another picture of Bojangles the Chihuahua
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.460]   out there, I'm done with all of this.
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.580]   Or this one.
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.460]   I promise.
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.840]   Promise, my roommate.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.940]   They eat Chipotle every day, I promise.
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.340]   Every day, they're gonna turn into one.
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.580]   Or this one, this is one of my favorite ones.
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:37.700]   Maybe this one when we cross the arms.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.500]   Like, let me be honest with you.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:44.220]   Like, as a dude, you use too many emoticons when you text.
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.500]   All right, I just wanna be honest with you.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.020]   It's weird.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:47.860]   It's weird.
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.420]   Just learn how to use, like, letters, okay?
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.940]   And here's my favorite one.
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.600]   My favorite one.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.460]   This is the one, like, that we use the most
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.620]   where we're calling on this to try to bring
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:00.980]   some validity to our statement.
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.140]   You know what it is?
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.920]   Literally.
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.740]   Or maybe if there's, like, a lot of emphasis,
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.580]   it's literally.
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.460]   Like, there's, like, a chuh in there.
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.280]   Literally.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.020]   And then that, which is clue for what is about
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.540]   to be said next is a wild exaggeration.
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:26.360]   Literally, that is the cutest outfit in the world.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.740]   I know all outfits and I know everybody in the world
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:30.580]   and you've got it.
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:31.700]   That is the cutest one.
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.080]   Just yesterday.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.180]   Yesterday, I was driving around listening to these guys
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.860]   on Sports Talk and they were talking back and forth
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.580]   about the Fourth of July.
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.260]   And one of the guys, they were saying, you know,
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.340]   hey, do you like going to the fireworks?
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.180]   And one of the guys was like,
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.060]   this may be the most un-American thing I've ever said.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.940]   No, I don't like going to fireworks.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.100]   Which, by the way, side point, I concur, I agree.
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.260]   I think they're way overrated.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.280]   But anyway, so.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.280]   But I cheered for US in World Cup soccer, all right?
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.940]   So does that make up for it?
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.460]   Okay, anyway, so.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.540]   He sat there and he was like,
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:06.900]   so you don't like going to see fireworks?
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:07.740]   Like, why?
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.900]   Why don't you like to see fireworks?
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.980]   And this grown man, he said this, he goes,
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.200]   I don't like going to fireworks because they're so loud
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.820]   and when it gets loud, it literally scares
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.760]   the crap out of me.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:22.380]   And I'm like, dude, like, so you're at the fireworks.
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.580]   Boom!
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.420]   Ooh.
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:28.860]   I gotta go, man, I gotta go.
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.020]   Man, we do this.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.260]   Our solutions, our solutions.
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:41.180]   Like, we understand that because we all know
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.420]   that we're guilty of lying,
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.620]   we all know that we're guilty of not keeping our word,
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:45.660]   but we all know there's times
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.380]   where we really are being serious.
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.220]   And we've done the exact same thing the Pharisees have done.
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.440]   We're calling on these outside sources
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.120]   to try to bring validity.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.720]   And it's not a solution.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.140]   It's not a solution.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.020]   It doesn't build our reputation, it damages it.
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.580]   And so we all struggle.
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.600]   Our solutions and these soft commitments,
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.020]   they don't help us, they condemn us.
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.560]   And this third point is this.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.520]   Jesus has a solution.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.180]   He's got something to say about this
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.900]   and he's got a solution and it's not complicated.
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.260]   It's incredibly simple.
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:29.660]   It's not easy, but it's incredibly simple.
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.420]   And so here's what he says in verse 37.
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:37.940]   All, all you need to say,
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:42.940]   all you need to say is simply yes or no.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.060]   That's it.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:51.240]   Anything else, anything beyond this,
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.380]   if you try to add anything else to your statements,
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:58.600]   that's not helping you, that's condemning you.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.420]   That doesn't show that you're a person that can be trusted.
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.440]   That shows that you're a person who struggles
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.300]   with keeping your commitments.
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:10.560]   Anything beyond this comes from the evil one.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.780]   And so Jesus is basically saying,
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:19.780]   hey, if you want, if you want to build credibility,
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.740]   if you want to have a reputation
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:26.020]   of being somebody who's trustworthy, don't lie.
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.100]   Keep your commitment.
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:33.060]   When you say you're gonna do something, just do it.
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:37.560]   If you said you're gonna call them back,
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.960]   you call them back.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.040]   If you said you're gonna go to the birthday party,
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.800]   you go to the birthday party.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.640]   If you told somebody you're gonna turn in the assignment
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.880]   at 8 a.m. on Friday, you turn it in at 8 a.m. on Friday.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.480]   When you tell a story, you tell it accurately.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.740]   If you said you were gonna do something, you do it.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.140]   That's Jesus' solution.
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.480]   Jesus would say, don't call on all these things
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.280]   to try to bring validation to your statements.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:10.640]   Let your reputation be all the validation you need.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.720]   That's the solution.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:16.400]   And so before we close, I wanna share with you guys
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.640]   three ways that I think that you and I tonight,
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.760]   like we can start to apply these things,
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.520]   three ways that we can take these principles
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.320]   from this passage and apply it to our life
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.320]   right now and in the way that we interact with others
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.240]   so that you and I can grow to be people
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.440]   who are trustworthy, people who keep our word.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.280]   And so there's three of 'em.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.320]   I'm gonna put 'em up here on the screen.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.440]   The first one is this, is that we need to be clear
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.280]   with our intentions, be clear with our intentions.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.560]   Because here's one thing I've noticed,
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.760]   is that a lot of us, I think we get ourselves into trouble
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.760]   when we just start just kinda talking.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.320]   We start dreaming, we start talking about the future,
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.920]   we start talking about what we're gonna do,
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.520]   and what we end up doing is inadvertently,
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.120]   we end up making commitments for ourself
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.880]   that we never intended to make.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.280]   And so for example, growing up in my household,
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.720]   we have what we call in my family,
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.560]   my dad and the Disney World incident.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.520]   And so from like as far as I can remember,
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.320]   as far back as I can remember, when I was real little,
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.560]   my dad just started promising
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.600]   that he was gonna take us to Disney World.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.640]   I'm gonna take you to Disney World,
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.480]   take you to Disney World.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.600]   My brother, sister and I, maybe this year,
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.840]   I'm gonna take you guys to Disney World,
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.680]   take you to Disney World.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.920]   I'm gonna take you to Disney World.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.120]   Years go by, we're not going to Disney World.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.320]   My dad finally took us to Disney World.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.640]   You know how old I was?
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.760]   17.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.440]   It's like the most uncool age to go to Disney World.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:41.080]   But he made good on it, and actually it was a lot of fun.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.400]   But what we ended up, what really happened is that my dad,
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.520]   it really damaged his credibility in our family.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.920]   Because when he would make other promises,
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.080]   we would say, oh, is this like a Disney World
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.440]   you're gonna take us to ice cream,
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.640]   or a real you're gonna take us to ice cream?
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.520]   Like, what is this?
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.480]   And all my dad needed to do,
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.960]   all he needed to do is he just needed
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.480]   to be clear with his intention.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.600]   And just go, hey guys, I would love,
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.480]   I'd love to take you guys to Disney World one day,
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.920]   if I could.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.280]   I don't know if we'll be able to,
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.720]   I don't know if we're gonna have the money to do it,
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.400]   but just know in my heart, I would love.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.360]   I think that would be a lot of fun.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.880]   I'd love to do that.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.240]   He would've just been clear with his intentions.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.080]   Now let me just talk to the guys in the room for a second,
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.440]   because if there's something that maybe
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.240]   one of the genders struggles with a little bit more,
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.000]   I think us guys, we struggle with this one
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.840]   a little bit more than the ladies do.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.520]   Because we're just like, we're out there,
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.920]   we're dreamers, we're leaders,
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.840]   and we're just talking about what we're gonna conquer
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.760]   and what we're gonna do.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.480]   And we, a lot of times, we are the ones
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.920]   who will get ourselves into a situation
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.080]   committed to something that we never intended
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.520]   to get ourselves committed to.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.920]   And we'll say things that we have no intention
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.400]   of ever backing up or ever doing,
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.640]   and things that we really can't back up.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.280]   And so guys, you in particular need to be
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.800]   very, very careful with this,
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.880]   because here's how this is gonna go down.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.720]   You're gonna be dating someone
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:09.680]   for like five or six weeks in a row.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.520]   And you're gonna have all kinds of these
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.800]   emotional ooey-gooey feelings going on,
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.200]   and you're gonna be like, this is so different.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.720]   Never met anybody like her.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:30.720]   And one night, you're gonna go out on a date,
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.960]   you're gonna take her to her door,
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.120]   and you're gonna be so nervous,
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.040]   not because it's like, are you gonna kiss her or not,
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.400]   'cause you're still in the handshake,
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.600]   side hug stage of the relationship,
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.960]   so you're good with that.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.720]   But you really wanna communicate to her
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.720]   what you're feeling.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.160]   So you're gonna look at her,
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.680]   and you're gonna get all this gumption up,
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.520]   and you're gonna look at her,
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.120]   and you're gonna go, baby,
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:58.640]   I love you.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:05.280]   And I am never, ever, ever, ever, ever gonna hurt you.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:10.560]   She's gonna look at you and just be like, oh my God.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.880]   I cannot wait to journal about this tonight.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.200]   This lady in waiting is almost done.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.540]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:33.240]   Then like two weeks later, she's gonna start annoying you.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.200]   And you're gonna go, and at the end of the day,
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.800]   you're gonna be like, you're so,
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:44.640]   just talking to the guys in my community group, and,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.240]   I think you're becoming an idol for me.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.640]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.960]   I don't even really know what that means,
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.940]   but I think that's what you're doing, and so like,
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:04.040]   so I think you're becoming, I mean, it's more me than you.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.720]   I mean, it's a little bit you, but it's a lot of me,
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.840]   and so like, we're breaking up.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:09.680]   We're done.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:14.200]   She's gonna look at you, and she's gonna go.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.080]   So this is love?
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:19.880]   This, this is love?
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:24.040]   You taking your hand and ripping my heart out,
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.600]   and squeezing it, and then putting it in a vice,
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.920]   and turning it, and then putting it in a blender,
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.320]   and pulsing it, and then pouring it down the drain,
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:38.520]   and putting the garbage disposal, like this is love?
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.200]   I don't know about you, but this hurts,
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.880]   and you said you were never gonna hurt me.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.520]   You're a liar, and she'd be right.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.200]   You can't back those words up, man.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.680]   You cannot back those up.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:58.000]   You've got to be careful what you get yourself into,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.920]   all of us, guys and girls.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.360]   We gotta be clear with our intentions.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.520]   We gotta telegraph all of that, and so number two,
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:09.800]   number two practical thing, and how we can do this,
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.120]   and how we can live this out, number, it's this,
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.600]   is that if we've made a commitment,
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.880]   if we've made a commitment, and then something happens,
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.720]   and let's be honest, always,
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.720]   there's often something that happens.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:25.200]   I mean, James is very clear in James chapter one,
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.400]   that when we, we don't know what tomorrow is going to bring,
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.440]   and so if you make a commitment for the future,
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.920]   there's things that happen,
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.520]   circumstances change that are legitimate,
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.880]   that will cause us that if we've made a commitment,
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:40.720]   and something happens,
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.640]   that we need to get out of that commitment,
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.760]   but even in that situation, when we've made a commitment,
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.080]   and we're gonna have trouble keeping it,
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.240]   there's still a way to get out of that,
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.040]   that's not gonna erode your credibility.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.400]   There's a way to do that, that will do the opposite,
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.920]   it'll build your credibility,
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.640]   and I'll illustrate what you do this way.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.400]   Let's say for your birthday, I bought you a watch,
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.800]   and I gave you a watch,
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.920]   and then let's say something happens in my life,
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.680]   a circumstance changes in my life,
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.640]   where I need that watch back,
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.760]   say my iPhone breaks, and I have no clue what time it is,
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.720]   and I need that watch back, all right?
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.240]   How do I get that watch back, what do I have to do?
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.080]   If I want that watch back, what I have to do,
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:27.480]   is I have to ask you for the watch back.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.200]   I don't break into your apartment,
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.640]   and just find out where it is, and just take it back,
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.160]   I don't wanna see you shake your hand,
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.080]   and be like, oh, that watch, yeah,
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.240]   and just take it off your wrist,
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.600]   and be like, my phone broke, what are you talking about?
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.520]   I need this back.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.960]   We don't demand it back, what you have to do,
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.920]   is you have to ask for it back.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.640]   And so when we break our,
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.600]   when there is a commitment that we've made,
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.960]   and we need to break it, this is what we need to do,
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.960]   and this is going to be profound, listen to this,
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.320]   this is gonna be profound, and if you do this,
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.840]   it's gonna change your life, literally.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.640]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:08.480]   Here's what you do, if you've made a commitment to somebody,
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.600]   and you need to break it,
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.080]   you handle it the exact same way with that watch analogy,
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:13.920]   what do you do?
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.400]   You don't demand for it, you have to ask to be released,
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.280]   and the reason you have to ask for it,
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.280]   is because what you gave, when you made that commitment,
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.640]   you gave somebody a gift, and what you gave them,
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.760]   is you gave them the gift of your time,
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.520]   and if you're breaking that commitment,
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.260]   you have to ask for that gift back.
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:37.920]   You call 'em up, you go down the office,
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.840]   you go to your apartment, you go wherever it is,
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.040]   you talk to them, and you go, hey listen,
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.960]   I told you that would be done at 8 a.m. on Friday,
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.640]   you give them the legitimate reason
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.920]   why it's not gonna get done,
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.600]   you don't make up an excuse, like something came up,
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.840]   and you say, I am not gonna be able to meet that commitment,
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.200]   can I have that time back?
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.600]   You say, hey, I know I told you Saturday,
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.680]   I was gonna drive you to the airport,
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.520]   but my sister is sick, and she needs me to watch her kids,
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.720]   can I please have that commitment back?
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.920]   You ask for it back, you don't demand it back.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:20.560]   If we need to break our commitments,
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:24.200]   there's a way to do it, where we're building our credibility
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.160]   and I'm telling you what guys,
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.080]   you get in enough of those conversations,
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.320]   where you have to ask for that back,
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.720]   enough of those awkward conversations,
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.840]   you get in enough of those,
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.080]   what you're gonna start to do,
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.880]   is you're gonna go back to practical idea number one,
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.560]   you're gonna start to really be careful
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.600]   about what you actually commit to,
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.000]   but there's a way that you can do that,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.360]   where you're not gonna be losing credibility,
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.400]   you're gaining it, and so if you've made a commitment,
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.920]   and you need to break it, you just ask for the time back,
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.080]   and the third is this,
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:57.160]   let's say you've made a commitment and you just broke it,
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.720]   and you didn't ask for it back,
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:03.560]   there's still a way, there's still a way to handle that,
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.720]   that's building credibility, not losing credibility,
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.320]   and what you do, is you talk to the person,
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.800]   and you ask them to forgive you,
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:17.400]   you call them, you go see them,
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.800]   you say, hey, I know I told you,
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.920]   I told you I was gonna be at your party Friday,
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.000]   and here's what happened, I got out of work late,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.240]   this crazy deadline popped up, I got out of work late,
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.040]   I was hungry, by the time I got food, it was 9.30,
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.680]   I knew that your party started at eight,
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.600]   I thought it was gonna be over, I was exhausted,
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.080]   and so I just chose to go to sleep,
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.520]   and I know I told you that I would be there,
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:42.080]   and I didn't show up, will you forgive me?
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.800]   So you're careful, be clear with your intentions,
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.400]   if you made a commitment, you need to be released,
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.760]   you ask to be released from that commitment,
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.120]   and if you've made a commitment and you broke it,
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:57.800]   you ask to be forgiven, that's building credibility,
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.120]   that's strengthening our reputation,
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.320]   that's honoring God,
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:08.560]   that's living by our word.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.880]   So that landlord, he called me that night,
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.440]   and was just saying, hey, you told me,
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.840]   you told me you were gonna sign the lease,
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.080]   you told me you were gonna sign the lease,
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.320]   you told me you were gonna sign the lease,
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.320]   and I was finally like, you know what, you're right, I did,
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.720]   let me talk to my wife about it,
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.800]   and let me call you tomorrow,
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   and so I hung up the phone and sat down with Jackie,
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.400]   and I was like, hey, I told him,
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:36.000]   I told him that we would do this,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.040]   and I know that we're legally covered right now,
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:44.640]   but being legally covered doesn't feel like good enough,
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.360]   being legally covered right now doesn't feel like
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:51.400]   that's the most God-honoring thing to do in this situation,
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.320]   and so we both talked about it, we both agreed,
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.240]   we both felt conviction
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.160]   over the way we had handled that situation,
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.520]   and we said, here's what we need to do,
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.040]   we need to sign the lease,
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.200]   and we need to make it very clear to the landlord,
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.640]   for the next 12 months, we are obligated to make sure
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.040]   that you are paid your fair rent for the next 12 months,
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.960]   so we signed the lease, and we told him,
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.600]   said, hey, I know that the way we've handled this
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.200]   has not been, or has been confusing,
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.840]   it's been frustrating to you, it's hurt you,
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.560]   thank you for telling us this,
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.560]   thank you for letting us know how confusing this has been,
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.560]   will you forgive us, and he was kind, and he forgave us,
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.600]   I said, we're on the line, he said, great,
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.200]   after that transaction was settled,
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.640]   then I went back to him, and I said, now, here's the deal,
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.120]   can we, I'm not gonna demand it, I'm asking,
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.480]   is there something we can work out?
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.560]   If we go find somebody, or if we put a sign in the yard,
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.360]   and we do the showings, like, if it's okay,
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.000]   if we go find you another tenant,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:50.840]   will you be okay with that,
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.280]   if you go find me another tenant, I'll be okay with that,
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.960]   and we talked to a couple friends,
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.240]   we had some friends that were looking to move,
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.360]   and our friends moved in there,
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.440]   and they stayed there two years,
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.360]   and they found some friends to move in there,
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.160]   and stay two years, and it all, it ended up,
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.760]   financially, it ended up all working out,
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.200]   but relationally, relationally, it hurt.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.560]   And handling that situation,
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.120]   I mean, even though we were okay legally,
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.000]   it still didn't feel like the right thing to do,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.600]   just to leave him out there when we had given him our word,
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.760]   and so, what Jackie and I decided to do was,
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.640]   hey, let's handle this the right way.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.640]   And it cost us something, it cost us a lot of stress,
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:33.080]   it cost us a lot of late night conversations,
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:37.040]   it cost us money, but in the end,
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:41.920]   in the end, our reputation was worth it,
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.120]   and it was worth it to do the right thing.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:49.480]   And here's why, guys, I'm so excited about this.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.320]   The reason I'm so excited about this,
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.680]   and what Jesus is saying tonight,
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.280]   in this section of the sermon on the cross,
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.440]   in the sermon on the mount we're looking at,
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.360]   is that if you and I do this, if we do this,
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.880]   if we become people of our word,
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.440]   if we say we're gonna do something and we do it,
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.560]   it's going to change the city,
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.520]   and here's why it's gonna change the city,
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:11.000]   because at the foundation of our faith,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.040]   at the foundation of our faith is the God of the universe,
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.760]   and one of the prevailing characteristics
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:20.240]   of the God of the universe is that he is faithful,
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.920]   that he is trustworthy,
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.920]   that he is a God who keeps commitments,
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.680]   and this God of the universe, this faithful God,
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.320]   this God that never backs down on his word
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.400]   has given every single one of us who follow him a job,
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.120]   and that job is to go and to be salt and light
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.360]   in this city, and here's what we know to be true.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.120]   There's a bunch of people in this city
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:48.000]   that do not trust God,
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.800]   and one of the primary reasons that they do not trust God
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.880]   is because they've met Christians and they don't trust them.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.960]   They see Christians that just say a bunch of stuff
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.000]   and Christians that say they're gonna do one thing
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:01.840]   and then they don't do it,
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.920]   Christians that are out there just living for themselves
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.880]   and selfishly and not keeping their commitments,
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.760]   and they're sitting there and it just looks just like them
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.160]   and all their other friends,
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.520]   and they're going, yeah, yeah, like,
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.760]   really, like, you want me to trust you
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.120]   who can't be trusted for anything?
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.400]   Like, you want me to trust you
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.480]   about this God of the universe that loves me?
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:25.080]   Sure, you look just like me.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:29.960]   And the other thing we know is this, guys,
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.320]   is that we know is that when people do trust God,
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:39.360]   they often trust a Christian first before they trust Christ.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.840]   I mean, all of us in here, I bet that's part of our story.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.080]   If we came to know Jesus,
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.400]   it was because we trusted somebody else first,
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:50.360]   then we trusted the claims of Christ.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:55.400]   And so we have this unbelievable opportunity
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.480]   to go out there and to be salt and light
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.440]   and to implore people to trust God.
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.800]   And it's gonna be really, really difficult for us
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.120]   to be salt and light if we cannot be people
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.960]   who are trustworthy.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.440]   So we get to go out there
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.200]   and we have this unbelievable opportunity
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.800]   to represent this God who keeps commitments.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.880]   And when we do this, when we do this,
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:23.640]   they will see a genuineness, a trustworthiness,
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:28.240]   an authenticity in our lives that will point not to us,
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.040]   but point to our Savior.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:34.600]   Your word matters.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.600]   It matters.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.080]   Let's pray.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.000]   God, we thank you.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.440]   We thank you, Lord, that you have kept your word with us.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.840]   That you have not left us alone,
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:52.400]   that you have seen the predicament that we're in
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.960]   and that the actions that we have engaged in
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:59.280]   that has caused separation between us.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:04.440]   And you promised way back in the garden,
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.920]   you promised that you were gonna do something
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.880]   about this issue of sin and you followed through
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.280]   and you sent your son Jesus and we are grateful.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:14.600]   God, we don't wanna be flaky people.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.360]   We don't wanna be people who are,
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.640]   quite honestly, just normal.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:26.240]   We understand that it's not just our reputation
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.200]   that's at stake with being people of your word.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.280]   What's at stake is ultimately your reputation.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.080]   The Pharisee's got that right, Lord.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:38.040]   So Lord, we come to you tonight and we beg you for help.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:42.440]   Will you help all of us to be people of our word?
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.040]   That our yes will be yes and our no will be no.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.760]   Will you help us?
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.960]   And we ask this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.800]   Amen.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.960]   - Yeah. - Cool.
