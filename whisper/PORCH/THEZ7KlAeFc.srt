 [MUSIC]

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 >> That was amazing, amazing.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 That was excellent.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,400
 I feel like we needed a wrecking ball swinging back and forth.

7
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
 What are you on it?

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,760
 >> I forgot my- >> Are you all not done?

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,500
 >> I'm not done.

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,360
 >> What'd you say?

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,400
 >> I said I forgot my outfit or- >> I don't think that outfit would be

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,080
 appropriate.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,400
 Are you all- >> I haven't even seen that video.

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,160
 >> I don't wanna end it.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,160
 I feel like we could all go for a little bit more.

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,080
 What a perfect way to start.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,280
 Tonight we are in a dating series.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,640
 So we're discussing just topics as it relates to dating.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,440
 That song is a popular breakup song right now.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,400
 And aren't breakup songs like the worst?

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,960
 Whether it's like Usher or Adele or Boyz II Men or

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,960
 everything Taylor Swift has ever written.

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,720
 >> [LAUGH] >> They're just like,

24
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,760
 especially if you're going through a breakup, they're just the worst.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,560
 So tonight, if you haven't guessed it, we are discussing this topic.

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,720
 My first experience with love and relationships happened when I was in

27
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,160
 the second grade.

28
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,520
 I was in Miss Ennihosa's class.

29
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,440
 It was a little brunette girl that sat right in front of me.

30
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,680
 And shortly after meeting this young lady,

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,240
 she came up one day on the playground wearing umbro shorts.

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,880
 And she asked, she told me, I think we should be boyfriend and girlfriend.

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,840
 Which was a little like, whoa, girl, initiating.

34
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,040
 But I was okay with it then, so I'm in.

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,880
 And so shortly after that, Valentine's Day came.

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,000
 Never had a Valentine before.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,520
 And she gave me a beaded ring that she had made with her mom.

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,080
 It was like, I was smitten.

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,160
 And I'm watching A Lot of Saved by the Bell at this point, for some reason.

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,080
 So this is my Kelly Kapowski.

41
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,280
 And shortly after that, all of my hopes and

42
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,080
 dreams for this relationship and blossoming one would be totally smashed to pieces.

43
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,000
 Because a few weeks later, she showed up and said, I think we should break up.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,920
 Yeah, I know, and as a seven year old, you're like, I thought we were going to

45
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,960
 the altar, what?

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,600
 Don't tell me that ring didn't mean something to you, that was a symbol, what?

47
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,080
 And not only that, she asked for the ring back.

48
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,800
 Yeah, like I pawned that thing.

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,000
 I don't even have any, it's not worth anything to them or me, what?

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,520
 But it was a first experience that I can remember just being, I don't even care.

51
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,480
 And it was really the first of a long number,

52
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,920
 a chain of just breakups that are painful.

53
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,240
 Regardless of how often, how well you date,

54
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,000
 they can still be hard to walk through.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,360
 And often it's like, yeah, we're just friends.

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,880
 She hates me, but we're still just, we're like friends that hate each other, and

57
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,360
 they're just hard.

58
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,200
 And so tonight, we're going to discuss the topic of breakups and how to break up,

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,560
 when to break up, and when not to break up.

60
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,680
 Because in the reality of life, in a dating world, which we live in,

61
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,880
 breakups are a part of that and a necessary one as we explore and

62
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,720
 search and find the right person.

63
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,600
 So we're going to go through, really, a list of when to break up.

64
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,640
 Because in this dating series, here's what we know.

65
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,760
 Dating is meant to lead to marriage.

66
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,000
 And so before you have a broken marriage,

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,520
 it is better to have a broken relationship.

68
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,680
 So we're going to cover some big ones.

69
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,640
 We've covered some of them before, but these are just ones of when to break up.

70
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,120
 Here's the first one.

71
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,120
 When they are not a follower of Christ.

72
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,760
 Not when they are not a Christian, or not when they say that they go to church.

73
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,280
 When they are not following Christ with their life, when the active pursuit and

74
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,600
 the path and direction of their life is not towards following Jesus,

75
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,920
 it is worth breaking up now before the destruction that lays in front of you.

76
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,960
 Here's what Paul says in 2 Corinthians 6.

77
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,680
 Do not be yoked or partnered together with unbelievers,

78
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,440
 for what do righteousness and wickedness have in common?

79
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:45,120
 Missionary dating, and this is so important, is a bad idea.

80
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,960
 It's a terrible idea.

81
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,040
 And here's why.

82
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,480
 You need to know this.

83
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,720
 Because you can fall in love with someone who does not believe the same things

84
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,000
 that you believe.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,960
 Do you know that?

86
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,120
 You can fall in love, you can give your heart to someone who is not a follower

87
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,920
 of Jesus, and it happens.

88
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,240
 Maybe it's happened to some of you in this room.

89
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,960
 And when a person, and the path of their life is not headed in the direction

90
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,400
 of Christ, it is going to be costly.

91
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,960
 And so you need to hit the ejection seat now.

92
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,320
 Because here's what dating is.

93
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,800
 Dating is a path that leads to a promise, that's marriage,

94
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,080
 that leads to a lifelong pursuit.

95
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,440
 That's what dating is.

96
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,000
 And so if you are dating or casually dating, and you're dating someone who's not

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,320
 of the same belief about Jesus is my Lord and Savior, and I'm committed

98
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,920
 to following Him, not just, "Hey, I'm a Christian, but I'm a follower

99
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,320
 of Christ," you need to break up.

100
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,040
 Here's the second one.

101
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,440
 When community around you has counseled towards this.

102
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,080
 So I'm going to pause before we do this one.

103
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,120
 This assumes that you're in community.

104
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,000
 If you are not in community or you are dating someone and you or they are not

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,200
 in community, you are going to be in trouble.

106
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,520
 You are missing out on God's provision for your life.

107
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,400
 One of the chief ways that He says He speaks to us is through the counsel

108
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,120
 of His people around us.

109
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,360
 And so if you are dating without community or the person you are dating does not

110
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720
 have community, what's community?

111
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,920
 Community is a group of believers who gather with them regularly or with you

112
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,040
 regularly and speak into your life.

113
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,520
 You are playing with fire, and it's going to end badly.

114
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,800
 Okay, so back to community.

115
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,880
 When community has counseled towards this, here's what I mean.

116
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,760
 I got a call this past week, and it was from a friend of mine who said,

117
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,720
 "Hey, look, I just have a question.

118
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,560
 I think I'm going to break up with my girlfriend, and she is a woman

119
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,440
 of incredible character.

120
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,080
 She is a godly woman, and she's wonderful.

121
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,160
 But there's something just where I don't see us moving towards marriage.

122
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,120
 Am I crazy to break up with her?

123
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,800
 I've spoken to my community, and they think the wise thing to do because I'm not

124
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,320
 moving towards marriage would be to break up.

125
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,040
 Is this crazy?

126
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,600
 Am I wrong?

127
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,680
 I hear the dating messages that you all do at the porch, and it just seems like I'm

128
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,120
 crazy for wanting to do this."

129
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,160
 And I told him, "No, not at all.

130
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,720
 If you're in a relationship and you're not moving towards marriage,

131
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:32,120
 then you're in a relationship that's pointless because dating is meant to lead

132
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,760
 to a promise that leads to a lifelong pursuit.

133
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:42,280
 And so if that is not the path that you are on, then hit the ejection seat now."

134
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,760
 This kind of repeats the same idea.

135
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:51,120
 When you are not moving towards marriage, here's a fourth one.

136
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,080
 When you are not on the same page about sexual purity, if you are dating someone

137
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,160
 and they are pulling you or pressuring you towards having sex, you need to get

138
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,760
 out now because breaking up at a later time would statistically,

139
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,920
 your chances increase dramatically.

140
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,000
 But even if stats are on the side, it is going to be significantly more

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,280
 painful if that day comes, if you are having sex with that person.

142
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,320
 And part of Paul's instructions to young men and women was, "Hey,

143
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,120
 flee sexual immorality."

144
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,080
 And so what you and I do in relationships where we're being pulled in that direction

145
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,840
 or pressured in that direction, that's one way we flee, is we break up.

146
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,360
 Here's what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6, 18, "Flee from sexual immorality.

147
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,800
 All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually,

148
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,240
 sins against their own body.

149
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,600
 Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you,

150
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,960
 whom you have received from God?

151
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,240
 You are not your own."

152
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,800
 Think about that.

153
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,560
 Paul says, "Look, hey, flee sexual immorality."

154
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,880
 And here's what you need to remember.

155
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,600
 And as you're doing that, you're not your own.

156
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,160
 Your body right now is on loan from God who loves you and wants you to use that

157
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,240
 body in a way that's not going to lead to pain.

158
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,560
 And he says, "You were bought with a price."

159
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,880
 And so flee sexual immorality and break up.

160
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,000
 And as hard as it's going to be, and it's going to be hard,

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,920
 so I'll just take a tangent.

162
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,840
 Breakups are just, they're hard.

163
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,200
 They really are.

164
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,520
 Even when you do it really, really well, they're still, we're emotional beings,

165
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,360
 so it just can be really painful or painful.

166
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,600
 So some of these things will really guard you against the catastrophic outcome that

167
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,280
 could be there and will be there if you do not do them, but they're just hard.

168
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:54,720
 That's why guarding your heart and taking things slow is so important.

169
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,080
 And seeing your dating as an opportunity where you will either honor or dishonor

170
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,400
 your heavenly father.

171
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,280
 My first conversation with our senior pastor, whose name is Todd,

172
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,960
 he was here a few weeks ago, was about this topic of dating where I literally

173
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,840
 had just met him.

174
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,680
 I sat down with him and he said, "Are you dating someone?"

175
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,640
 And this was like five years ago, I wasn't.

176
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,800
 And I said, "No."

177
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,320
 He said, "Why not?"

178
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,840
 Which is always like a funny question.

179
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,960
 I feel like, "You're not dating."

180
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,480
 "I don't know.

181
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,760
 I have lip fungus or something.

182
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,720
 I'm just not."

183
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,760
 And he said, "Okay, that's great.

184
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,840
 Well, here's the deal.

185
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,000
 There's a lot of young ladies on our staff.

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,520
 You get one shot.

187
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,960
 If you break her heart, if you don't lead her well, if you do anything that causes

188
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:47,000
 her at the end of that relationship to say, 'I'm totally great with him dating any

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,240
 other girl on our staff,' then you don't ever date anyone on our staff again."

190
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,560
 And that's why I didn't date anyone on our staff again.

191
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,320
 But his point was, "Look, if you do not leave her better than you found her,

192
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,960
 which is your responsibility as a Christian man, then you won't date again,

193
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:12,440
 and you will dishonor God, and there will be other consequences to go along with that."

194
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,760
 And so this is just the last thing about breaking up.

195
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,600
 I think, believers, as you break up and walk through this, that we are called to do

196
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,640
 this gently and honorably to the other person.

197
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,000
 As much pain is involved or as low as you think that that other person is or doesn't

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,440
 really matter and this is how I feel, here's what we do know, that whoever he or

199
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,120
 she is, if you're breaking up, this is really important.

200
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,040
 It's really important to Jesus.

201
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:47,680
 They are someone that Jesus died on the cross for and says, "He's mine."

202
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,920
 And so as you walk through that, and it's going to happen, it may need to happen

203
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:59,320
 after tonight, do it gently, speaking honestly, not blaming it on God,

204
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,880
 but speaking honestly.

205
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,600
 And here's the last one.

206
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,920
 Here's when to break up, before we get married, which I wish went without saying,

207
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,920
 but it clearly hasn't in our country.

208
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:21,920
 And so we're going to discuss when not to in marriage and that when to not break up,

209
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,000
 i.e., marriage, and really Jesus' words on marriage and on divorce.

210
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,640
 But here's what we know about divorce.

211
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,680
 This is what Time Magazine said a couple of years ago.

212
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,840
 "There is no single force causing as much measurable hardship and human misery in

213
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,320
 this country as the collapse of marriage."

214
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:45,000
 Five out of 10, between four and five out of 10 people are having divorces.

215
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,480
 The amount of pain and misery in our land is almost incalculable.

216
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,080
 Psychology and sociology has done studies and they've discovered that when a person

217
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,320
 walks through a divorce, I promise this is going somewhere.

218
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,680
 If you're going, "Why are we talking about this?

219
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,760
 I'm not married.

220
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,320
 I'm not even dating right now."

221
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,280
 I promise it's going somewhere because remember, dating is a path and most

222
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,000
 likely you will get married.

223
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,560
 In fact, 80% of you will get married before you leave the decade you're in.

224
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:23,200
 And dating is a path that leads to a promise, that leads to a lifelong pursuit.

225
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,720
 And there is nothing destroying our nation like the collapse of marriage.

226
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,080
 And the war against marriage is not coming from the homosexual agenda,

227
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,520
 it's coming from within the church and the collapse of the sanctity of marriage

228
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,800
 between man and woman, divorce.

229
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,960
 And this message is so important for you and for me and for our nation to hear

230
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,040
 because we live in a culture that says nothing close to what God's standard

231
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,680
 of marriage and divorce is.

232
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,200
 Kanye West in the club going, "We want prenup, we want prenup."

233
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,720
 It comes not close in any way.

234
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,320
 That's right.

235
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:13,360
 And any time, as we said last week, a nation or a people devalues something,

236
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,440
 as we're going to see tonight with marriage, God says is of incredible value,

237
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,800
 the result is catastrophic.

238
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,480
 And so we're just going to explore what Jesus says about this because there is a

239
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:32,720
 tidal wave of destruction pouring through our land.

240
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,480
 Some of it's been poured into this room, it's been poured into my life.

241
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,120
 Divorce in every way that I look, is there my grandparents, my parents,

242
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,720
 sibling, my wife's parents.

243
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,480
 And Jesus has something to say about it.

244
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,680
 And I promise you this, you're probably going to learn something

245
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,880
 about what his view on marriage, which is very distinct from the culture

246
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,720
 around us, but his words in the midst of a culture that so devalues marriage

247
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,480
 are breathtaking.

248
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,120
 And we're going to see it.

249
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,360
 We're going to be in Matthew 19 as we explore what Jesus has to say about this

250
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,680
 topic about when to not divorce and why this is so important because all of you

251
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,200
 are heading towards that direction.

252
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,320
 And maybe the generation before us, nobody told them.

253
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,960
 And oftentimes, the problem is people like this that do what I do or do what JP

254
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,920
 does, they stand up here and they do not teach what Jesus said because it's just

255
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,000
 not practical as it relates to marriage and divorce.

256
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,400
 And so we're going to discover what he says.

257
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:35,600
 And I'll say this, I don't like what Jesus says or I'm not comfortable with it.

258
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,640
 It makes me uncomfortable.

259
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,480
 And I know that the people who heard what Jesus had to say about marriage felt the

260
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,200
 same way.

261
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,200
 In fact, this is the response that they had.

262
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,440
 The disciples who said to him, this is Matthew 19, verse 10, "If this is the

263
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,440
 situation," as Jesus discusses marriage, "between a husband and a wife, it's better

264
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,240
 to not marry."

265
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,640
 And you would expect Jesus, if we're going to see what he says, you'd expect him to go,

266
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,360
 "Oh, no, no, no, marriage is awesome.

267
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,160
 You got to do it.

268
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,840
 It's great."

269
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,240
 He goes, "Yeah, some people can handle it, some people can't."

270
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,520
 And he walks off.

271
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:19,120
 And so if that's not the response or if that is the response you feel as we leave

272
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,720
 tonight, I feel it with you and we probably understand it appropriately.

273
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,400
 But here's what he says.

274
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,600
 So Matthew 19, verse 3, we're going to pick it up right there.

275
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
 "Some Pharisees came to test him."

276
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,040
 Pharisees were these legal experts or experts in the Old Testament and they were

277
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,880
 always trying to test Jesus because Jesus was really popular with the people and they

278
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,840
 didn't like that.

279
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,000
 So they come up and they're going to test him about this subject.

280
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:53,120
 And they asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?"

281
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,720
 So here's what they're asking.

282
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,520
 What are the circumstances under which it's possible to get a divorce?

283
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,320
 When would it be possible for a husband and wife to split up?

284
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,120
 And in Jesus's day, there were two schools of thought.

285
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:11,560
 There was one school that said you can get a divorce anytime you want.

286
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,440
 If you find someone who's prettier, if you find...if she burns the toast,

287
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,960
 that's literally written in the literature from the first century.

288
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,520
 You can walk away, talk about security there.

289
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,680
 If you find anything wrong with her, you can marry someone else.

290
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,560
 And then there was another school of thought that said only if there's been

291
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,920
 sexual immorality or adultery can you divorce your wife.

292
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,760
 And so they asked Jesus, "Hey, we want to know where you stand.

293
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,320
 What are the circumstances under which a man can divorce his wife?"

294
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,840
 And here's what he says.

295
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,640
 "Haven't you read," he replied, "that in the beginning, the Creator made them male

296
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,720
 and female?"

297
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,560
 And the Pharisees are going, "Okay, Jesus.

298
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,240
 Okay, that's great.

299
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,160
 That's fascinating.

300
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,520
 Male and female in the beginning.

301
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,160
 What are the circumstances under which a man can get a divorce?"

302
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,960
 Don't go off topic or give me a parable.

303
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,480
 What are the circumstances under which...and here's what he says.

304
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,320
 And said, "For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be united."

305
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,800
 That's the word "glued."

306
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,800
 It's the same word that appears at this time in other literature for glue.

307
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,080
 If you glued something together.

308
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,560
 "A man will leave his father and mother and he will be united or glued to his wife

309
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,080
 and the two will become one flesh."

310
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,040
 Jesus says, maybe you didn't realize this, but when marriage takes place,

311
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,960
 when a man and a woman come together, it's not just a ceremony and a honeymoon.

312
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,240
 It's not just a certificate and then there's some exciting stuff afterwards.

313
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,240
 He says, "No, no, no, no.

314
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,560
 There's something so much bigger and there's another party involved."

315
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,600
 And he's going to tell us who it is.

316
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:54,200
 "So the two are no longer...so they are no longer two," verse 6, "but one flesh.

317
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,040
 Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate."

318
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:06,080
 That Jesus says, when a person, a man and a woman get married, that they no longer are

319
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:13,920
 just Jack and Jill, but the two have been two entities who have now become one.

320
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,480
 And they cannot be separated.

321
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,000
 That they're no longer these two different things.

322
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,160
 He says, "Look, when the two came together, you didn't realize it.

323
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,600
 You may not have thought it, but when you marry that person or when a person marries

324
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:35,040
 a spouse, they become united in a way that they cannot be separated," is what he says.

325
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:41,080
 He essentially says this, "The goal of marriage is not oneness.

326
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,720
 The result of marriage is oneness.

327
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,840
 And you may not have realized it."

328
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:55,640
 But this is Jesus who's saying, "When that took place, they are no longer two, they are

329
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,280
 one person.

330
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,520
 And you cannot separate a person.

331
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,320
 They may not feel like it and may not look like it, but," he says, "God has done something

332
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:13,040
 and He is the active agent in every wedding and in every marriage.

333
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,880
 And He is uniting and has united someone in a way that it cannot be separated."

334
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,640
 You can't now try to take some of the water and you pour some in here and you pour some

335
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,480
 in there and it's not the same.

336
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,960
 And he says, "What God has joined together, man cannot separate."

337
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,780
 In effect, they're saying, "Hey, when is it permissible?"

338
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,520
 And he says, "It's not even possible.

339
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,300
 You're asking the wrong question."

340
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,640
 And that right there is where Jesus stops his answer.

341
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,680
 And in fact, he just says, "Don't do it.

342
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,280
 You can't."

343
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,960
 And we want to run to circumstances.

344
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,160
 My mind, my heart runs, "Wait a second.

345
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,640
 What about she walked out and he did this and there was abuse and what about..."

346
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:04,920
 And Jesus just says, "It's not possible that there was something deeper going on and maybe

347
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:10,600
 no one even told you or your parents.

348
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,280
 But God has joined them together and you can't separate them."

349
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,120
 And at this point, Pharisees are going high-fiving each other because they're going, "Wait a

350
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
 second.

351
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
 He contradicted Moses.

352
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
 Moses wrote about divorce.

353
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
 Okay, now we got him.

354
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,120
 Okay.

355
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
 Okay.

356
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
 So Jesus, verse seven.

357
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:32,560
 "Why then," they asked, "did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of

358
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,880
 divorce and send her away?"

359
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
 Jesus replies.

360
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,800
 So they're referring to Moses in the Old Testament wrote a law where, "Hey, if a husband divorces

361
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,200
 his wife, he has to give her a certificate."

362
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,560
 Here's what Jesus says.

363
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:54,440
 "I tell you," whoops, "Moses," verse eight, "Moses permitted," whoops, that was powerful,

364
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,360
 "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives.

365
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,360
 Moses didn't command you.

366
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,840
 Moses permitted you because your hearts were hard."

367
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,320
 Here's what he says.

368
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,680
 "You know the history of your nation.

369
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,120
 You know what was taking place.

370
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,680
 In Moses' day, women could not divorce their husband.

371
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,920
 In Jesus' day, it was the same way.

372
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:24,080
 Moses instituted divorce because the husbands were hard-hearted," he says.

373
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,520
 "They were kicking their wives out saying, 'I'm going to do what I want to do.

374
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,840
 I'm not going to care for you anymore, so good luck out there.'"

375
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:39,000
 And because they would not yield, their hearts were hard, Moses said, "I'm going to have

376
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,120
 every husband who does that write a certificate of divorce."

377
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,040
 So they have to sign their name so that when the wife is kicked out, she's not just going,

378
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,920
 "I'm just sleeping around," and she can say, "No, he divorced me.

379
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,400
 I've got no place to go.

380
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,920
 Can I sleep here tonight or go back to her family with proof that I'm not just running

381
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
 away?

382
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,920
 I have been divorced."

383
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:06,200
 And Jesus says, "You know why, because of sin, because to protect the women, in order

384
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,920
 to protect women."

385
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:16,960
 But he says this, "But it was not so from the beginning."

386
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,520
 Because here's what we know about marriage.

387
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:30,240
 We can add rules, we can change rules, but in the beginning, God created it, and marriage

388
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,120
 belongs to him.

389
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:39,880
 And he says, "Divorce belongs to man, but in the beginning, it was not so."

390
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:46,020
 This next sentence is the most debated sentence as it relates to this topic that there really

391
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,840
 is in this passage and maybe in the New Testament.

392
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,280
 So buckle up.

393
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,680
 "I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for sexual immorality," we're going

394
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,000
 to come back to that phrase, "and marries another," I tell you that anyone who divorces

395
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,720
 his wife except for sexual immorality and marries another woman commits adultery.

396
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,720
 Jesus says, "If you think because a court gave you a certificate that you are no longer

397
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,560
 one, but now you're two, you've been divorced," he said, "you may have recognized that.

398
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:19,480
 Your mom may have recognized it, your grandma, the court may have, but in God's eyes, he

399
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:27,480
 hasn't, that you cannot separate what God has made one."

400
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,800
 And they're thinking, "Wait, Jesus, I'm not sure you understand.

401
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,140
 When a person who's divorced marries another person, that's not adultery, that's a divorced

402
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,140
 person getting married.

403
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,560
 I mean, you're not understanding the terms.

404
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,840
 A divorced person cannot commit adultery against this person.

405
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,560
 They're divorced, they're not married anymore."

406
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:53,200
 And Jesus says, "No, you cannot separate it."

407
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,760
 The phrase, "except for sexual immorality."

408
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,640
 There's two ways, really, that we understand this verse to work.

409
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,640
 The first just says, "Hey, that is the exception clause that Jesus gives, that, hey, you can't

410
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,160
 get a divorce except for if there's been sexual immorality in a relationship."

411
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,240
 It's a general word, not meaning adultery, it just means sexual immorality.

412
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,920
 I mean, of course, lust, anything.

413
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
 That's the only case.

414
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,680
 So that's one way that people understand it.

415
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:27,520
 The second is that this is not a reference to adultery, because it's just the word "porneia."

416
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,920
 So if it was just porneia, it means just lust of any kind.

417
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,560
 The second is that, hey, this is not for the case of adultery.

418
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,800
 In other words, Jesus isn't saying, "Hey, when you get, if someone commits adultery,

419
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,080
 you have an out."

420
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,440
 And that argument is based on a few things.

421
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,840
 Here, I'm just gonna give you kind of the reasons why that camp believes what it does,

422
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,960
 and you can decide for yourself.

423
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,600
 Because this phrase, the exception clause, does not appear in the other places where

424
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,600
 this is taught, in Mark and in Luke.

425
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,640
 That "except for sexual immorality," it just says, "I tell you, anyone who divorces his

426
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,680
 wife and marries another commits adultery."

427
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,040
 That's all it says.

428
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,800
 That's Mark 10 and Luke 16.

429
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,220
 You can go read it later.

430
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,860
 And so that's one reason, and the reason they think it's in Matthew is because Matthew was

431
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,120
 written to a Jewish audience.

432
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,040
 The other ones are written to Greeks and to Romans.

433
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:20,640
 And so to the Jews, this word, "porneia," represented something that happened in Jewish

434
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,640
 culture.

435
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,640
 Here's what happened.

436
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,080
 In the betrothal period, which is like engagement, when a person, when there was sexual immorality

437
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,560
 during the betrothal or the engagement, you had to have a divorce.

438
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,080
 Some of you guys may have a broken engagement.

439
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,200
 You couldn't just break an engagement in this culture.

440
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,720
 You had to legally get a divorce.

441
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:46,160
 And the grounds for which it was okay to divorce were sexual immorality, porneia.

442
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:51,520
 And so when Jesus says this, they think that he's referencing during the betrothal period,

443
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,280
 which is very confusing.

444
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:00,800
 But this is why Joseph had to divorce Mary quietly once he found out she was pregnant.

445
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
 Ever wonder that?

446
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,960
 Why does he have to divorce her?

447
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,060
 The betrothed.

448
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:09,360
 Because in this culture, which is also in Matthew 1, 18, betrothal had to be divorced.

449
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,200
 And so that's the camp of how this is not, this is referring to that.

450
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:19,080
 The second reason is because the church fathers did not see remarriage as even possible for

451
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,020
 the first 500 years.

452
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:27,200
 That they thought, okay, they can get a divorce in man's eyes, but not in God's eyes.

453
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,600
 And so they can't marry again.

454
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:35,080
 So anyone who divorced in the first 500 years of the church, they could not ever marry again.

455
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,680
 Because their one flesh they were no longer with, or their one flesh was still alive and

456
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,160
 still around.

457
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,920
 The second reason would be just the porneia.

458
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,960
 This is again why people think that this does not allow, Jesus is not giving an out for

459
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
 marriage.

460
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,500
 It is permanent.

461
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,960
 Even if you don't recognize it as such.

462
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,500
 The next reason is just the word porneia.

463
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,960
 Jesus would not be making it a smaller scope that you can get a divorce.

464
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
 He'd be widening it.

465
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,080
 He'd say, look, any husband who's ever looked at a woman lustfully, women you can divorce

466
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,360
 your husband.

467
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,720
 Which would include every husband that's out there at the part of his body.

468
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,240
 And so clearly that's not what Jesus is saying.

469
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:28,680
 And I think one of the stronger reasons for this case against the permanence of marriage

470
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,520
 is the picture that marriage presents us.

471
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,560
 Ephesians 5 says this, that it is a portrait of God's love for the church.

472
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
 That's what marriage is.

473
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,520
 It's so much bigger than a honeymoon and flowers.

474
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,080
 That it is a picture of God's unending love.

475
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,520
 Here's what Paul says in Ephesians 5.

476
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,520
 Look at this.

477
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,560
 This is like crazy.

478
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,320
 For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife.

479
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,320
 We just saw that.

480
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
 And the two will become one flesh.

481
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,320
 Oh, that's great, Paul.

482
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,780
 You're talking about marriage.

483
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,660
 This is a profound mystery.

484
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:06,360
 But I am talking about Christ and the church.

485
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
 Wait a second, Paul.

486
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
 No, no, no, no.

487
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
 You're talking about marriage.

488
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
 You said a man and a woman come together.

489
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,680
 And he says, no, no, no, no.

490
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:19,880
 Marriage is a picture of God's unending love for the church and his pursuit of you and

491
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,320
 me even when we commit adultery with the idols in our life.

492
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,880
 And it's so much bigger.

493
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,800
 And I think the last reason for why this permanence or the strongest argument for this permanence

494
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,940
 is the disciples' response.

495
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,940
 Verse 10 again.

496
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:46,160
 "The disciples said to him, 'If this is the situation between a husband and a wife, it's

497
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,360
 better to not get married.'

498
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:55,480
 To which Jesus responds, 'Jesus replied, 'Not everyone can accept this word, but only those

499
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,520
 to whom it has been given.

500
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,760
 For there are those who are eunuchs.'"

501
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,120
 Which is not really a term that we use today.

502
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,360
 But a eunuch, we don't really do this surgery anymore.

503
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
 We do it to our dogs.

504
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,080
 But in these days, eunuchs were just a person who had that sexual anatomy removed.

505
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,720
 He said, "Some people have been eunuchs."

506
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
 They were born that way.

507
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,120
 Others have been made eunuchs when they would serve in a place where the king didn't want

508
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
 them.

509
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
 We'll just keep going.

510
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,840
 "And there are others who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom.

511
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,080
 There are some people who have been born that way, and there are some who choose to stay

512
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,080
 single."

513
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,560
 He's talking about singleness for their life.

514
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,280
 "And whoever can accept this should."

515
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
 Wait a second.

516
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
 Jesus, you didn't even respond.

517
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,720
 You just said, "If this is the case, it's better to not marry."

518
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,760
 And he goes, "If that's what you think, then don't get married.

519
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,280
 Stay single for the kingdom."

520
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:55,360
 But there is something deeper, and God is the one and the active agent at work.

521
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:03,320
 And what he has joined together, you cannot separate.

522
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,960
 So here's the application of why I think this is so important.

523
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,800
 We were gonna talk about sex tonight.

524
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,680
 I feel like that would have been so much more exciting of a talk.

525
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,280
 This is so depressing.

526
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,480
 And you guys look depressed.

527
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,600
 So here's the application.

528
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,160
 You would know what you're walking into.

529
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,720
 If you are dating someone, this is what you're heading towards.

530
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:32,840
 And our culture doesn't come close to what God says about marriage.

531
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:38,280
 And it is an abomination to him.

532
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:45,640
 And as you date, you are stepping on a path that leads to a promise, that leads to a lifelong

533
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:54,960
 pursuit that is a reflection of God's lifelong, unending pursuit of his bride, the church.

534
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:02,600
 And so now, you need to choose and date wisely.

535
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:09,080
 As to choosing who will be your master, choosing who will be your mate is the most important

536
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,480
 important decision that you'll make.

537
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,480
 And so choose wisely.

538
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,120
 Marriage is a wonderful thing.

539
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:26,520
 But according to Jesus, it's something that is far more significant than often we understand

540
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,080
 or realize.

541
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,360
 God holds an incredibly high value.

542
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:43,000
 That either it's not possible, or it would be like amputation with one flash.

543
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,120
 What if I had been divorced?

544
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,920
 If this is a part of your story, you need to go to divorce care.

545
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,160
 Divorce care meets on Tuesday nights.

546
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:56,280
 It's an amazing ministry where they will help lead and walk through all the pain that's

547
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,120
 involved with walking through something like that.

548
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:07,400
 And I think you need to pursue reconciliation with your spouse.

549
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,120
 What if they're not a believer?

550
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,760
 It doesn't say it matters.

551
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:20,920
 First Corinthians 7, it says if they abandon, then just let them go, but not to remarry.

552
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,560
 But God's heart is always for reconciliation.

553
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:28,000
 And we as ministers of reconciliation, which is what Paul says we are in 2 Corinthians

554
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 5, are called to be reconcilers of the world around us, including the marriage.

555
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,560
 And so if that's a part of your story, and I think at the least you've got to wrestle

556
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,000
 with this stuff.

557
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,160
 You've got to wrestle with it.

558
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,200
 Because here's a question.

559
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,840
 Let's say it doesn't matter if you pursue reconciliation.

560
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,840
 Divorce is great.

561
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,960
 The world around us, knock on most church doors and they'll say, "That's totally great."

562
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,160
 The world around us won't give you that.

563
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,880
 But let's say, let's say for a second that it's actually true.

564
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,880
 That Jesus, if we're understanding it right, he says don't separate what he has made one.

565
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:16,560
 If it's true, I just want to ask, would you be willing to stay single for the rest of

566
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
 your life?

567
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,080
 Not, hey, do it.

568
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,860
 I'm just saying, hey, if it was true.

569
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:33,000
 If you were 100% certain, would you be willing to stay single?

570
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:40,540
 Or if it was 100% certain that God's will for you was to pursue reconciliation, regardless

571
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:45,200
 of what they did or how many times they left, whatever the circumstances was, would you

572
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
 be willing?

573
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
 Just would you be willing?

574
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,780
 If it's 100% true, would you be willing then to pursue reconciliation?

575
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,820
 I'm not even saying it is.

576
00:34:53,820 --> 00:35:01,380
 I'm just saying if we were able to drop our emotions, would you then?

577
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:07,100
 And this is so huge because the generations that have gone before us have done such a

578
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,860
 poor job about modeling this.

579
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,300
 And here's what we know.

580
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:16,860
 There's a lot of debate, but it is a big deal to God because he says it is a picture of

581
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,040
 my unending love for the church.

582
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:26,220
 And so if I ever abandon my church, then you can abandon your wife.

583
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,220
 But I never will.

584
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,220
 And I'll never give up on her.

585
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:36,900
 And he won't ever give up on you if you're a part of that.

586
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,100
 And so that is to be displayed in the marriages.

587
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:46,100
 And God says it is a big, big deal to him.

588
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:52,060
 I feel like this message, I read it, and it just like raises more questions for me than

589
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,060
 answers.

590
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:58,700
 I'm like, Jesus, what about, let's say Bob and Mary, and I feel like it just feels so

591
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,700
 condemning.

592
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,260
 It's like, wait, Jesus, picking on divorced people.

593
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,820
 And here's what I would say.

594
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:09,260
 If that is, or if that's been a part of your parents' story, whatever story, when you read

595
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:14,340
 the gospels, it may seem like that here, but that's not the Jesus you interact with.

596
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,780
 Like he didn't just go around condemning people like, oh, you got divorced and you slept with

597
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,600
 her and you're just a liar.

598
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,860
 And going around telling people all the things they did bad.

599
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:25,920
 He walks up to a woman, we said this last week, who just committed adultery.

600
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,220
 And here's what he says, I don't condemn you.

601
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:35,100
 And if that's a part of your story, any shame that you're feeling, I don't think if Jesus

602
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:41,360
 was here, you would have felt.

603
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:50,780
 But this is the incredible truth about what marriage is and the high standard it has.

604
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:56,840
 And regardless of where you are in the room on that scale, there's an incredible grace

605
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,340
 that's coupled with that every time we encounter Jesus.

606
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:07,940
 And he offers it to us tonight.

607
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,520
 But what is clear is it is a very big deal to God.

608
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,420
 And so you need to wrestle with it, because if you're not walking through it or haven't

609
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,400
 ever walked through it or won't ever walk through it, the person sitting next to you

610
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,100
 will, statistically.

611
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,520
 And so you need to figure out where that is before you get there.

612
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,100
 That we're gonna fight.

613
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,420
 There's pictures of this idea of what marriage is.

614
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,520
 Marriage is not just a man and a woman, that it is God's picture of how he loves us and

615
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,500
 how he loves his people all throughout the Bible.

616
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,940
 One of the clearest ones of them is a book called Hosea, where an entire book of the

617
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,860
 Bible is devoted to this.

618
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,020
 And here's what happens.

619
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,020
 This is like such a crazy story.

620
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:56,800
 Hosea was a prophet who lived 700 years before Christ.

621
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,540
 And he was a prophet to the people of Israel.

622
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,220
 So God would show up and he'd say, I'm gonna have a prophet who's gonna speak to the people

623
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,880
 on my behalf.

624
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,220
 And he showed up to Hosea and said, you're gonna speak to the people on my behalf, but

625
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,540
 I want you to do something.

626
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,020
 So God shows up and he tells him this, this is the second verse in the chapter.

627
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,180
 I want you to go and marry a prostitute.

628
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,900
 And I want you to have children of prostitution.

629
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:24,100
 It's so shocking, because if you're Hosea, you're like, am I sure this is God right now?

630
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,260
 I feel like that sounds more like the devil or something.

631
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,380
 And her name was Gomer.

632
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:33,020
 It's like, she didn't have a cool prostitute name, Gomer.

633
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,380
 So he says, I want you to go marry this prostitute.

634
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,500
 And in the same sentence, he says, and you're gonna have children of prostitution that you're

635
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:48,700
 gonna raise, that she's going to have sex with other men and you will raise her children.

636
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:55,980
 And it will be a picture of how my people have committed and forsaken adultery, committed

637
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,300
 adultery and forsaken me.

638
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,300
 And you are going to love her.

639
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:06,380
 It says God put in Hosea's heart that he would love her over and over and over again in the

640
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,860
 face of terrible, gut-wrenching circumstances.

641
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:14,660
 There's one point where she, after they had just had their kid, they just had a baby,

642
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,440
 she goes out and she begins sleeping with other men around the town.

643
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,420
 And she eventually gets sold by one of these lovers into slavery.

644
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:28,620
 And Hosea brings her food and he brings her water and he cares for her even when she refuses

645
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,620
 to come back home.

646
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:34,220
 And he goes and he sells some of his property and he raises up enough money and he buys

647
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:38,460
 her back and he brings her home.

648
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,060
 And then she does it again.

649
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:46,540
 And God says, you love her like I have loved you.

650
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,540
 And I'll never stop and I'll never give up.

651
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:54,980
 And that we, when we are unfaithful, he is faithful.

652
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,420
 And that is what marriage is a picture of.

653
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,220
 I think we know this at some level.

654
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,780
 That's not supposed to end in divorce.

655
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,660
 I mean, even the vows that we take.

656
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:10,060
 When I got married to my wife, we took these vows and we stood before this pastor and we

657
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,300
 said these vows.

658
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,300
 And here's what they were.

659
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:18,740
 They were just that I promise I take you to be my wife, she said husband, to have and

660
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:22,980
 hold from this day forward for better or for worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and

661
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:31,140
 health, to love and to cherish from this day forward until death do we part.

662
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,820
 And most of us don't, we don't think like that.

663
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:38,740
 We would say really the vow should be until you sleep with my sister or until you run

664
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,660
 out and get a lot of credit card debt or until you get ugly.

665
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,260
 And then I think I'm out of here.

666
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,260
 It's true.

667
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:54,300
 In fact, I only know one pastor, it's actually Todd, who in the wedding says, he includes,

668
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,700
 including addiction, including adultery, you are not leaving.

669
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,980
 There's nothing that can separate you.

670
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,900
 And that's what it is for me and Callie.

671
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:11,820
 That not only if she gets in a car wreck and is paralyzed, but if she sleeps with my best

672
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:16,260
 friend and oh my gosh, how much pain would that be?

673
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:24,620
 But I'm called to pursue and to love because it is a portrait and a picture of what God

674
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,460
 has done for you and God has done for me.

675
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:33,540
 And it's so much bigger than I think most of us realize or maybe we even can because

676
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:39,020
 two have become one and what God has united, let no man separate.

677
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,020
 And that's what you're headed towards.

678
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,020
 I'm going to pray.

679
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:49,020
 Father, I just, man, this is such a hard, hard topic.

680
00:41:49,020 --> 00:42:00,420
 And I have so many questions about what you do in all these different circumstances.

681
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:06,900
 I know in the room, there's a hundred of us who have experienced and walk through something

682
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,940
 like this.

683
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,500
 And maybe, maybe it was right.

684
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,500
 Maybe it's what you wanted.

685
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,980
 Maybe it wasn't.

686
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:20,060
 And we have experienced pain and hurt and someone who didn't love us.

687
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:27,140
 Like you tell us you love us and you tell us a husband and wife are to love each other.

688
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,140
 So will you help us tonight?

689
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,780
 Will you heal our wounds?

690
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:36,180
 You are the God who heals and will you help us to pursue your design and your goal and

691
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,820
 the beauty that is marriage?

692
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,700
 Beautiful because it reflects how you never give up on us and you're faithful even when

693
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,700
 we are not.

694
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:45,700
 Amen.

695
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,220
 Amen.

696
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,220
 Amen.

697
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:48,220
 Amen.

698
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:48,720
 Amen.

699
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,720
 Amen.
