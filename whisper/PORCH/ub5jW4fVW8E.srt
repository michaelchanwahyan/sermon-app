00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,320
 Love it.

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,080
 We are wrapping up the series AD tonight.

4
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,920
 Yes, tonight.

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,120
 Welcome, friends in the room.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,920
 Welcome, friends downtown, friends

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,880
 in Fort Worth and Houston.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,800
 How y'all doing?

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,300
 Very good.

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,240
 Love it.

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,720
 The Olympics are here.

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,400
 Let's go.

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,000
 Team USA, man.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,560
 I think girls soccer team won tonight, too.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,080
 Who doesn't love America?

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,960
 Is baseball an Olympic sport still?

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,360
 Man, it's like on again, off again, on again, off again.

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,480
 I'm going to start with a story related to baseball.

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,480
 And not related to the Olympics, but here we go.

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,760
 So a couple of years ago, I was going

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,720
 to see my nephew, who had just become old enough

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,880
 to begin playing baseball.

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,340
 So he's like five or six years old.

24
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,760
 This is his first baseball game.

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,560
 I'm pumped.

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,760
 First of me and my siblings' kids

27
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,640
 that are at age to be able to play in competitive sports.

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,080
 So as a guy, you're like, yes, finally somebody is there.

29
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,880
 We can go root them on.

30
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,840
 This is going to be awesome.

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,120
 We can live through this kid.

32
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,760
 And so we're at--

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,440
 I go to the game.

34
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,200
 I'm wondering, how do they throw?

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,120
 Is it underhand?

36
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,760
 How fast do they throw the ball to a five or six-year-old?

37
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,120
 Show up at the game.

38
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,480
 They don't throw the ball.

39
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,840
 They use a tee.

40
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,040
 It's like golf, essentially.

41
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,160
 They set it on this tee, and this baseball is set on there.

42
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,160
 And so these five or six-year-olds will come through,

43
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,200
 and they'll attempt to hit.

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,920
 So I'm waiting, see my nephew, come up to the plate.

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,400
 I'm all in.

46
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,920
 I'm watching.

47
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,720
 I'm rooting him on.

48
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,000
 His name is Pierce.

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,720
 Comes up to the plate, takes his first hack,

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
 and it wasn't pretty.

51
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,920
 Hits the tee, ball falls right on the ground.

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,760
 It's all right, slugger.

53
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,600
 Pick the ball back up.

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,760
 Everything's going to be OK.

55
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,000
 Coach puts the ball back on the tee, one strike.

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,920
 OK, I'm thinking, you got two more.

57
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,080
 This is going to be great.

58
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,680
 Don't embarrass me.

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,400
 That's not what I was thinking.

60
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,960
 But I was thinking, this is going to be awesome.

61
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,800
 You got two strikes.

62
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,520
 Takes his second cut, totally misses the tee and the ball

63
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,040
 in general.

64
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,400
 I'm like, dude, it's 20 inches away from you.

65
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,640
 How did you miss?

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,600
 It's all right, though.

67
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,360
 That's only two strikes.

68
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,320
 We got one strike left.

69
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,520
 This is going to be great.

70
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,960
 Rears back, takes his third cut, hits the tee,

71
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,120
 ball goes right down, strike three.

72
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,400
 I'm like, man, buddy, you struck out.

73
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,040
 It's all right.

74
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,000
 I struck out once, too.

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,400
 And I'm expecting to see him-- that's so not true.

76
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
 I'm expecting to see him, hey, you've

77
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,920
 got to head back to the dugout.

78
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,200
 It's OK, three strikes.

79
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,840
 It's all right.

80
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,040
 Maybe next time you struck out.

81
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,280
 And all of a sudden, the coach picks up the ball

82
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,920
 and he puts it back on the tee.

83
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,160
 And I'm going, did I miscount?

84
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
 What happened here?

85
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,080
 OK, watch it again.

86
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,280
 Takes a swing, misses it again.

87
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,240
 Coach takes the ball, puts it back on the tee.

88
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,080
 I'm like, that's four strikes.

89
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,440
 What is he doing out there?

90
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,520
 Misses again.

91
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,000
 It's like six, seven, eight strikes.

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,600
 I'm like, what type of game is this?

93
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,280
 First off, everyone gets a trophy,

94
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,400
 and then everybody gets a guaranteed hit.

95
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,560
 The coach continues to put the ball on there saying,

96
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,880
 hey, look, you have not struck out.

97
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,200
 Everyone continues the hit.

98
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
 You have not blown it.

99
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,360
 You have not missed your chances.

100
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,040
 And he continues to put the ball on there

101
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,720
 so that he waits for each kid until they get a hit.

102
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,480
 Then they run to first base.

103
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,960
 Now, the reason why I start there

104
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,640
 is because I think a lot of us, when it comes to God,

105
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,580
 we feel like his perspective of us

106
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,840
 is not dissimilar to mine on my nephew at that point.

107
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,920
 I'm like, hey, buddy, you only got this many chances

108
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,780
 and you struck out.

109
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,720
 It's over.

110
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,400
 That when we think of how Jesus sees us,

111
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,480
 we're in the room tonight and we are interested in God.

112
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,360
 Maybe we wouldn't say we're a Christ follower.

113
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
 Maybe we're not a believer or not there yet.

114
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,520
 You're interested.

115
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,300
 You wanna go to heaven.

116
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,400
 But when you look at your life,

117
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,720
 you think that you have struck out when it comes to Jesus.

118
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,680
 When it comes to God, you've just made mistakes.

119
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,280
 You can look in the rear view mirror and you're like,

120
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,060
 look, if there is a God out there,

121
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,800
 I'm pretty sure that when he looks down at me,

122
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,200
 he's a little disappointed going like,

123
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,600
 hey, take a seat on the bench.

124
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,360
 Maybe I'll let you back in, maybe not.

125
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,880
 And the perspective that you have,

126
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,280
 if that is your belief, is off.

127
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,760
 And there's either something about God

128
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,960
 that you don't realize or you don't know him at all.

129
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,040
 Because as we're gonna discover,

130
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,820
 and I'm gonna attempt to convince you tonight,

131
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,920
 and I believe that this will revolutionize your life,

132
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,200
 that just like in that scenario where Jesus,

133
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,840
 or where that coach continues to put the ball on the tee

134
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,020
 and says, hey, you don't get just two chances, one chances.

135
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,800
 I'm a God of unending chances.

136
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,000
 I will continue to pursue, continue to encourage,

137
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,240
 continue to be here to see you hit the ball off the tee.

138
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,440
 Just like that, in the same way,

139
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,500
 Jesus comes to all humanity and says, I will not give up.

140
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,000
 You have not blown your chance with me.

141
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,020
 And if you're ever gonna know me,

142
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,660
 it's gonna come by you understanding and embracing,

143
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,160
 that's the type of God that I am.

144
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,640
 And so tonight, we're gonna see that

145
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,320
 as we wrap up the series and we continue to explore AD.

146
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,880
 AD is a series that's been based on encounters

147
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,740
 that people have with Jesus.

148
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,380
 Encounters with really God in the flesh.

149
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,620
 The Bible teaches that if you ever wanna know

150
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,140
 what God looks like, you see that in Jesus.

151
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,340
 Jesus is, as we've said, God in a body.

152
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,500
 He's God on the planet with skin on.

153
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,460
 That's who Jesus is.

154
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,780
 So if you wanna know what does God look like,

155
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,400
 when God looks down at me, what type of face

156
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,340
 is looking at me or what type of person,

157
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,800
 what character is looking at me, what is God like?

158
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,300
 You see it in the face of Jesus.

159
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,000
 And so tonight, we'll see it an additional time

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,700
 in the story of Jesus and maybe the most notorious person

161
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,300
 of all the encounters that we've looked at in this series.

162
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,140
 We're gonna be in Luke chapter 19.

163
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,500
 Luke chapter 19, if you have a Bible,

164
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,340
 you can flip open there.

165
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,740
 If you don't have a Bible, it'll be up on the screens.

166
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,360
 On that note, we have free Bibles if you're in Dallas

167
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,140
 in the Welcome Center for you.

168
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,840
 If you don't have a Bible, we'd love to give that to you

169
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,520
 as your gift in Fort Worth.

170
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,580
 I'm not sure where they are over there,

171
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,180
 but Garrett, get 'em some Bibles.

172
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,420
 (congregation laughing)

173
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,300
 And so flip open to Luke 19.

174
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,700
 Here's what's going on in the chat, Book of Luke.

175
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,340
 Luke was a doctor.

176
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,720
 Dr. Luke wrote down and recorded the gospel.

177
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,620
 He went around interviewing all these different people.

178
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,700
 He records one of these stories with a guy named Zacchaeus.

179
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,940
 If you grew up like me in Sunday school,

180
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,580
 you know that Zacchaeus was a wee little,

181
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,780
 a wee little man was he.

182
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,460
 That's right, he climbed up in a--

183
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,740
 - [Congregation] A forest tree.

184
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,820
 - Man, I love it.

185
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,020
 Let's go, VBS, represent.

186
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,860
 Let's go.

187
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,700
 (congregation laughing)

188
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,740
 And we're gonna explore his story

189
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,440
 because Zacchaeus was not just a wee little cute story

190
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,860
 from VBS, but was one of the most notorious sinners

191
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,360
 and traitors in all of the Bible, if not the most.

192
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,380
 And so we're gonna explore what that looks like

193
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,700
 as we see Jesus's encounter with him.

194
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,780
 Like Luke said, next week we will kick off

195
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,780
 the dating series that you do not want to miss.

196
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,980
 So Jesus is on his way to Jerusalem.

197
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,620
 This is towards the end of Jesus's last week,

198
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,580
 or right before he's about to start his last week on earth.

199
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,180
 And he chooses to spend time,

200
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,720
 and he interacts with this man.

201
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,820
 So here we go, starting in verse one.

202
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,340
 Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.

203
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,140
 Now, Jericho is like Beverly Hills at this time,

204
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,980
 like for real.

205
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,180
 Jericho, there's writings from this time that said,

206
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,820
 "Look, you can wear," it's so funny,

207
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,040
 "You can wear linens all year round.

208
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,380
 "You can wear that," that's literally in the literature

209
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,540
 from a historian of this time,

210
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,260
 where it was like Beverly Hills.

211
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,380
 It had this really warm 70 degrees year round.

212
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,580
 Everyone wanted to live there.

213
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,740
 And on top of that, it's the richest city

214
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,140
 in the whole country.

215
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,280
 There was lots of money coming in and out of here.

216
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,660
 Jesus is walking through the city on his way to Jerusalem.

217
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,380
 Here's what happens.

218
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,380
 And a man there, and a man was there by the name of Zacchaeus.

219
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,540
 Now, Zacchaeus was a tax collector, and he was wealthy.

220
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,980
 So the narrative just changed

221
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,460
 for the original audience who read this.

222
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,660
 All of a sudden, they're told not only is his name,

223
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,100
 there's a guy whose name's Zacchaeus,

224
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,460
 they're told something about them

225
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,700
 that would have triggered all kinds

226
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,220
 of emotional responses in them.

227
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,780
 He was a tax collector.

228
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,100
 Now, we think tax collector, we think like IRS,

229
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,940
 and they're still not like,

230
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,780
 "Yeah, that's just what I wanna be when I grow up."

231
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,700
 But we don't have the perception of hatred

232
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,540
 that people would have had

233
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,780
 in the first century for tax collectors.

234
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,900
 Tax collectors, here's what Rome did.

235
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,140
 They'd go to a place, and they'd conquer it,

236
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,740
 and they were ruthless.

237
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,820
 And they basically go, "Hey,

238
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,800
 "we're gonna take you guys' money.

239
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,000
 "And the way we're gonna do it is,

240
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,260
 "whoever has the highest bid for having the position

241
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,500
 "of collecting money gets to be the tax collector."

242
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,740
 So Jews especially hated Romans,

243
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,100
 and they hated tax collectors

244
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,300
 'cause they had betrayed their countrymen.

245
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,980
 And the way that Romans got 'em to do it was they said,

246
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,320
 "Hey, look, if you become a tax collector for us,

247
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,160
 "you can tax as much as you want.

248
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,600
 "You can take money from anybody

249
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,460
 "for any amount at any time."

250
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,420
 They were known of being corrupt.

251
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,140
 They were hated by their people.

252
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,980
 It was a job, a position in society.

253
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,260
 It would be like being the drug cartel in Mexico

254
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,380
 or a mob boss in Italy.

255
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,380
 It was a position that even by being

256
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,100
 in that position or profession,

257
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,720
 you're like, "That dude is not, he has no faith.

258
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,560
 "He has no morals.

259
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,260
 "He is just, he is nothing."

260
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,220
 And so Zacchaeus was a hated man, hated and feared

261
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,460
 because he'd show up on the street,

262
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,180
 and he could take anything he wanted to from you.

263
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,500
 And so we're introduced to who he is.

264
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,820
 Not only that, we're told something else.

265
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,540
 It says he was a chief tax collector.

266
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,620
 So he's not just been in this game

267
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,800
 for a short amount of time.

268
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,940
 He's been in it, he's been ruining people's lives for years

269
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,060
 and years, had totally abandoned any faith.

270
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,400
 And it says this.

271
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,200
 But he wanted to see Jesus.

272
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,460
 But because he was short, he could not see over the crowd,

273
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,200
 so he ran ahead and he climbed a sycamore tree

274
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,420
 since Jesus was coming that way.

275
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,580
 So Zacchaeus runs ahead.

276
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,000
 Jesus at this point in his ministry,

277
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,980
 like this is towards the end, he's like a rock star.

278
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,460
 Everywhere they go, people are like,

279
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,020
 "Dude, that guy raised somebody from the dead.

280
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,300
 "My cousin was dead, he's alive."

281
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,100
 Words getting around, Jesus, everywhere he goes,

282
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,940
 like, "I've seen him."

283
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,540
 He literally, he touched somebody's eyes

284
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,820
 and they could see again.

285
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,420
 So Jesus, people are passing word.

286
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,660
 I think the Messiah's in town.

287
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,180
 I think the Messiah's coming through.

288
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,860
 The Messiah's coming through Jericho.

289
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,980
 A parade begins to form around.

290
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,700
 Zacchaeus shows up at the parade.

291
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,440
 He can't see Jesus because he's too small.

292
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,220
 Now, to be called the word that is used for small

293
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,200
 in this time period would have been roughly around this,

294
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,900
 it would be under five foot, essentially.

295
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,080
 So think like he's Simone Biles height,

296
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,920
 if you know who that is.

297
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,960
 And if you don't, you are not an American.

298
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,240
 And, (laughs)

299
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
 she's a gymnast.

300
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,280
 He's like Danny DeVito.

301
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,360
 He's like Danny DeVito being like,

302
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,400
 "Hey, guys, let me in here."

303
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,360
 So he can't see and he runs over and he's like,

304
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,400
 "I wanna see Jesus."

305
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,800
 So he begins to climb up this tree

306
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
 and he climbs in this tree, he's watching the parade,

307
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,520
 he sees Jesus, he's walking by,

308
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,840
 he's trying to see this man they think is the Messiah.

309
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,680
 All of a sudden, Jesus stops right in front of the tree.

310
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,120
 Here's what happens.

311
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,840
 When he reached the spot, Jesus looked up and said to him,

312
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,880
 so he's now looking up into this tree

313
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,960
 and he sees a man and he says,

314
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,820
 "Zacchaeus, come down immediately.

315
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,840
 "I must stay at your house today."

316
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,680
 So he came down at once and he welcomed,

317
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,760
 Zacchaeus comes down and he welcomes him.

318
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,880
 Glad that you wanna stay at my house.

319
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,520
 Nobody wants to stay at my house.

320
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,360
 Nobody likes me.

321
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,760
 You wanna stay, Jesus, the Messiah wants to stay at my house?

322
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,920
 And all the people saw this and they began to mutter

323
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,920
 and he said, "He, Jesus, has gone to be the guest

324
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,800
 "of a sinner."

325
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,060
 In this society, to say, "Hey, I'm gonna come have a meal

326
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,800
 "or I'm gonna stay at your house."

327
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,420
 It's not that dissimilar to really in our own society,

328
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,100
 but it's saying, "Hey, I wanna associate with you.

329
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,340
 "I wanna identify with you.

330
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,640
 "I want us to have a relationship.

331
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,760
 "I wanna be friends with you."

332
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,240
 It'd be like if you go into town

333
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,800
 and you stay in whatever town you're from

334
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,840
 or you have friends and relationships with,

335
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
 who are you gonna stay with?

336
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,600
 People that you identify, people who you're friends with.

337
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,520
 And they say, "You're staying with Zacchaeus?"

338
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,600
 And you may be thinking like, "Man, this is why I love Jesus

339
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,020
 "because he's always going after the marginalized,

340
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,680
 "you know, the prostitutes, the beggars,

341
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,640
 "all the people that."

342
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,080
 Zacchaeus is not the marginalized.

343
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,560
 He's not a victim of the system.

344
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,000
 He's the dude running the system.

345
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 He's the guy who's ruined other people's lives.

346
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,800
 He is the pimp behind the sex trafficking thing.

347
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,920
 Does that make sense?

348
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,080
 He's the guy that's not like, "Oh, man, I feel so."

349
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,760
 Zacchaeus doesn't feel bad for Zacchaeus.

350
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,520
 Feel bad for what, man?

351
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,420
 All the money that I got?

352
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,160
 The house that I got?

353
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,280
 You feel bad for me?

354
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,160
 Zacchaeus doesn't.

355
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,060
 And the crowd, that's why they respond and say,

356
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,440
 "What is Jesus?

357
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,300
 "Surely this man's not the Messiah.

358
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,880
 "Does he know who he's associating with?"

359
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,460
 And Jesus goes into the home to be with this man.

360
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,920
 It brings us to our first idea from the text

361
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,560
 that when it comes to God's acceptance,

362
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,280
 there are no exceptions.

363
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,160
 Said otherwise, there are no exceptions

364
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,960
 to God's acceptance.

365
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,120
 In other words, there is no person in this room,

366
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,580
 in history, in our world, in any time

367
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,920
 throughout the human race that has ever been outside

368
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,880
 of the boundaries of God's acceptance.

369
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,780
 There's no person who God has looked at and he said,

370
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,820
 "Look, your behavior has placed you outside of the boundary

371
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,440
 "of someone that I would associate with,

372
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,880
 "someone that I wanna be friends with,

373
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,820
 "someone that I accept, someone that I love,

374
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,160
 "someone that I would pursue,

375
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,780
 "someone that I will be around.

376
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,640
 "Before you ever do anything right, Zacchaeus,

377
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,820
 "I'm coming to your house.

378
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,360
 "There are no boundaries on my acceptance."

379
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,440
 Said otherwise, there are no exceptions

380
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,400
 to God's acceptance.

381
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,980
 Like this is what God is like.

382
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,720
 When Jesus, who shows us what God is like, shows up,

383
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,000
 he says, "I'm gonna spend time not just with the prostitute,

384
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,540
 "with the thugs.

385
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,620
 "With the gang leader.

386
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,100
 "Because there's no one who's outrun my love.

387
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,900
 "There's no one outside of the boundaries

388
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,020
 "of my acceptance of them.

389
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,460
 "There are people who may not accept my acceptance

390
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,260
 "and have placed themselves outside of the boundaries

391
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,700
 "of those who I would accept, but it's not coming from God."

392
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,500
 I think a lot of us feel like the crowd would feel,

393
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,540
 I mean, that's why the crowd gasps, right?

394
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,460
 'Cause the crowd is going like, "Dude, are you serious?

395
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,340
 "Do you know who this, this is a bad dude, Jesus.

396
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,500
 "This is not a good person,

397
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,820
 "and you're going to spend time with him?"

398
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,100
 Because they think, like many of us think

399
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,140
 or have thought in seasons past,

400
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,460
 that God's opinion of us or God's love for us

401
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,860
 is based on what we do or based on what we have not done.

402
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,820
 Like we feel like if God's gonna have a relationship,

403
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,260
 if God's gonna like us, honestly,

404
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,700
 one of the biggest lies that is all over our world,

405
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,540
 that God's opinion, God's love for us

406
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,220
 is based on what we do or have done.

407
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,060
 God's love for you is not determined

408
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,420
 by what you've done or what you do.

409
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,700
 He doesn't need you to get your house

410
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,820
 and get your life in order,

411
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,340
 in order for him to pursue, to approach,

412
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,180
 for him to be a part of your life.

413
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,500
 Said otherwise, I think a lot of us think like,

414
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,340
 in order for God to want to be with me,

415
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,340
 I've gotta like make some changes.

416
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,500
 Like I gotta get it together.

417
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,020
 I need to start going back to church,

418
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,860
 that's why I'm here tonight.

419
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,420
 'Cause I'm like, man, if God's gonna like me,

420
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,380
 I'm sure I've just done too many things.

421
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,580
 I've messed up too many times.

422
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,020
 I've made too many mistakes.

423
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,020
 When God looks at me, I just think he's disappointed.

424
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,860
 And the story of Zacchaeus,

425
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,340
 really the message of the gospel

426
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,620
 is that there is no person,

427
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,860
 there's no exception to God's acceptance.

428
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,460
 And you don't have to get it all together

429
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,780
 before he will approach and wants to be a part of your life.

430
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,940
 It's not dissimilar from this.

431
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,180
 My community group meets,

432
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,340
 so I'm a part of this small group.

433
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,860
 We meet once a week, Thursday nights.

434
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,660
 We meet at someone's different house.

435
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,300
 We've been in this season where we've been meeting

436
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,940
 at my house, me and my wife's house on Thursday nights.

437
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,700
 So on Thursday nights, we gather at the Marvin's house,

438
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,860
 we're getting together, it's all great.

439
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,420
 Here's what that means for me.

440
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,100
 And this is just gonna be a free tip

441
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,460
 for all the guys in the room who someday may get married.

442
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,780
 It means that after work on Thursdays,

443
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,620
 we have one objective in our home.

444
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,180
 It is for me to rush home from work, come home,

445
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,300
 and all of a sudden, it's cleaning time.

446
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,980
 We gotta get everything vacuumed,

447
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,860
 we gotta get the dog get off the couch,

448
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,500
 we gotta get things cleaned up, we gotta fold this,

449
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,300
 we gotta put this stuff in this closet,

450
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,100
 we'll deal with this later, we gotta clean things up,

451
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,940
 we gotta light a candle, playing some music.

452
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,200
 Here's some cookies I baked.

453
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,380
 We gotta get everything out, right?

454
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,300
 We gotta get everything in order, and I'm like, why?

455
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,820
 And she's like, because they're coming over.

456
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,820
 I'm like, they're our community.

457
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,140
 This feels inauthentic.

458
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,740
 We don't have cookies every night, I need you to know.

459
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,140
 (laughing)

460
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,900
 Oh man, I'm gonna get in trouble for that.

461
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,580
 And, (laughing)

462
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,820
 oh man, I'm so off track.

463
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,580
 So anyways, I'm going, hey, we do not need

464
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,340
 to get all these things in order.

465
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,260
 In the same way, right or wrong in that situation,

466
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,740
 it's not wrong to wanna get things in order

467
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,860
 for your community group to come over, I guess.

468
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,220
 But, in the same way, I think for many of us,

469
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,680
 as it relates to God, that's how we think about him.

470
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,020
 Like, hey, I think God is here,

471
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,940
 I need to make sure I'm in church,

472
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,060
 and I haven't looked at porn in two weeks,

473
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,580
 and hey, I'm getting out of this relationship,

474
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,860
 and God, I'm trying to tithe a little bit more,

475
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,700
 and I'm trying to do this better,

476
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,740
 and we try to hold everything,

477
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,580
 we try to make ourselves look presentable,

478
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,060
 as though that is going to be the thing

479
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,260
 that allows God to be welcomed in our home,

480
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,180
 or will make God want to be a part of our life.

481
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,980
 And it's just ridiculous.

482
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,780
 And so many of us have bought into that idea,

483
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,140
 where you're sitting in the room,

484
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,460
 and if that's a part of your story,

485
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,900
 if you're going, does God, when he looks at me,

486
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,140
 is his opinion of me, one of like,

487
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,900
 man, I would not wanna be a part of your life.

488
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,860
 The story of Zacchaeus is for you.

489
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,220
 Because the story of someone who did way worse things

490
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,940
 than I promise you you will ever do,

491
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,940
 he financed the murder of his family.

492
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,620
 He financed the murder of Jewish people around him.

493
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,260
 That's what tax collectors did.

494
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,300
 We're gonna pay for the Romans,

495
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,400
 who are the guys killing us all around here.

496
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,980
 We're gonna pay for them.

497
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,620
 And even that person, Jesus says,

498
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,420
 no person is beyond my acceptance.

499
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,320
 The other group in the room that's fallen for a lie,

500
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,160
 that God's opinion of them is related to the behavior,

501
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,700
 is those who think, man, God does love me,

502
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,940
 'cause I'm a good person.

503
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,180
 Like, you know, I followed the DARE program

504
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,420
 when I was growing up, and I saved myself for marriage,

505
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,100
 and I pay my taxes on time, and I try to be nice,

506
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,780
 and I'm a good person, and I read my Bible,

507
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,740
 and I'm not like those crazy people who smoke that,

508
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,380
 and do that, and drink that.

509
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,780
 I'm one of those good people.

510
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,460
 And so God probably is a little bit more pleased with me.

511
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,140
 God is pleased.

512
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,540
 And both of those, whether you think God can't love you,

513
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,340
 or God does love you, because of your behavior,

514
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,660
 you're thinking like the crowd,

515
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,260
 you're not thinking like Jesus,

516
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,700
 and you're not thinking in line

517
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,480
 with how God sees humanity.

518
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,480
 That there is no exceptions to those that God will accept.

519
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,220
 Your performance does not determine his love.

520
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,880
 God's love for you is not determined

521
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,700
 on what you've done or what you do.

522
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,320
 I mean, even, and this, we'll move on.

523
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,760
 Even the fact, I mean, think about this,

524
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,960
 and I know this is so common, so I'm hitting this hard,

525
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,540
 'cause I believe that, like, as much as we're like,

526
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,380
 yeah, it's not, there's part of us that still believes that.

527
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,940
 Even think about the idea of, like, if it was based

528
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,320
 on your behavior, God doesn't see humanity

529
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,400
 like we see humanity.

530
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,240
 Here's what I mean by that.

531
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,060
 Like, you're like, yeah, Thursday and Friday,

532
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,960
 it's been a great week.

533
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,660
 I think God's probably like, hey, that a boy.

534
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,820
 Champ, go get him.

535
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,060
 That that's how God's looking down, and it's like,

536
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,380
 hey, it's been a great week, and I just feel close to God.

537
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,300
 God doesn't see Thursday.

538
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,860
 He sees six years from now all the things

539
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,180
 that you're gonna do between now and then,

540
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,620
 for all eternity.

541
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,200
 And he sees everything in your past,

542
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,860
 and everything you're gonna do next week,

543
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,780
 things you haven't even thought about,

544
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,660
 people you haven't even met yet,

545
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,700
 and the ways that you've treated them.

546
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,980
 And despite knowing all of that, he says,

547
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,180
 I'm gonna die on a cross for you.

548
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,700
 That's how much I love you.

549
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,460
 That's how much my love for you is not determined

550
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,460
 by what you've done or by what you do.

551
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,740
 I sit outside of time.

552
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,140
 I see all of it.

553
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,640
 Don't buy the lie that your behavior puts you

554
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,420
 outside of the boundaries of my acceptance.

555
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,980
 You may put yourself outside if you do not accept

556
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,480
 the free gift that I offer.

557
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,580
 But I'm not the one placing you outside of there.

558
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,960
 And Zacchaeus' message is a testimony.

559
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,620
 There's no exceptions to God acceptance.

560
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,860
 It also tells us something else.

561
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,860
 Here's what happens.

562
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,420
 They go in and they have this meal.

563
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,020
 He's sitting down with Jesus.

564
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,340
 Well, did it last four hours?

565
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,740
 Did it last an hour?

566
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,980
 Did it last a night?

567
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,500
 He said, I'm gonna stay with you.

568
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,700
 Maybe it took all night.

569
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,760
 But Jesus and Zacchaeus have this meal,

570
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,340
 and at some point, everything changes.

571
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,820
 In other words, at some time between verse seven

572
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,780
 and verse eight, which we're about to look at,

573
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,340
 everything changes.

574
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,380
 Zacchaeus changes.

575
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,220
 Here's what happens.

576
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,580
 He sits down at this meal, and all of a sudden,

577
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,140
 at some point in the meal, maybe he goes through the steps

578
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,180
 that happen when you become a Christian.

579
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,800
 There's conviction and then a conversion.

580
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,140
 And it leads to this repentance.

581
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,980
 And here's what he says.

582
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,940
 And the meal stands up.

583
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,300
 Maybe he takes his glass, ding, ding.

584
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
 And he says this, Lord,

585
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:44,260
 here now I give half of my possessions to the poor.

586
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,460
 If I've cheated anybody out of anything,

587
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,220
 I will pay it back four times the amount.

588
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,780
 At some point between verse seven and verse eight,

589
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,460
 he goes and he has this meal, and everything changes.

590
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,520
 That Zacchaeus bumps into Jesus,

591
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,100
 and everything begins to change.

592
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,980
 And how powerful is this testimony?

593
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,300
 I mean, how powerful, this that takes place,

594
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,820
 how crazy is this gonna be for everyone inside of the town

595
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,260
 as they begin to bump up into Zacchaeus,

596
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,140
 who has now met Jesus, his life has been turned around.

597
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,900
 He says, this is Bill Gates saying,

598
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,780
 I'm gonna sell half of everything that I own,

599
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,580
 and I'm giving it to the poor.

600
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,740
 And anybody, this is the cartel leader,

601
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,620
 and anybody that I've wronged,

602
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,460
 I'm not just gonna make up for it by saying,

603
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,220
 hey, look, I stole this from you,

604
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,600
 I'm gonna give it back to you,

605
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,260
 I'm gonna give four times the amount of what I've stolen.

606
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,620
 You ever had something stolen from you?

607
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,620
 Like if your car, like my car's been broken into,

608
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,700
 and they steal your radio.

609
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,300
 This would be like somebody showing up six months later

610
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,700
 on your front porch going, hey, I met Jesus,

611
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,100
 and I brought your radio back, and four other radios.

612
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,300
 That's what Zacchaeus just did.

613
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,100
 He says, look, anybody that I've defrauded,

614
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,700
 whatever I've done, I mean, think about it.

615
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,340
 How powerful is that?

616
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,060
 Hey, honey, Zacchaeus is at the door.

617
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,660
 Act like we're not home.

618
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,460
 I think he knows we're home.

619
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,940
 Yes, open the door, Zacchaeus is there.

620
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,320
 Look, I've stolen from you, I have a tax refund for you.

621
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,460
 The amount that I took, and four times that amount,

622
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,580
 I met Jesus, my life has changed.

623
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,700
 I gave half of everything that I owned to the poor.

624
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,180
 I mean, how crazy and amazing is that story?

625
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,500
 How powerful is that to showcase

626
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,160
 that Jesus can change anybody?

627
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,100
 Which brings us to our second idea from the text.

628
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,100
 There is no mess that he cannot use to be a ministry.

629
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,160
 There's no part of your life, no mess in your life.

630
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,180
 By mess, I mean mistakes, ways that you have just said,

631
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,700
 man, I look around, and everywhere that I look,

632
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,540
 I've blown it.

633
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,260
 There's no part of your story in your past,

634
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,140
 no addiction, no abortion, no anything,

635
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,020
 no relationship, no sexual promiscuity,

636
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,620
 where you're just like, man, I had one partner

637
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,460
 after the next.

638
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,540
 There's no part of your story that God cannot say,

639
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,220
 I'm gonna take that mess, and I am going to make

640
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,740
 a ministry out of it.

641
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:04,260
 I'm going to use it to be a part of ministering

642
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,820
 to the world around you.

643
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,120
 And Zacchaeus, who, if there was any person

644
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,640
 who had made a mess in his life,

645
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,940
 who had made mistake after mistake,

646
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,620
 who had run from God, all of a sudden encounters Jesus,

647
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:22,100
 and everything changes, and his mess becomes his ministry.

648
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,620
 I met Jesus.

649
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,940
 I'm giving this away to the poor.

650
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,780
 Even the fact that how much he gives back,

651
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,420
 how much he restores, is four times the amount

652
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,900
 of what was legally required.

653
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,380
 Like, he goes way above and beyond.

654
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,300
 He radically encountered Jesus, and he radically changed.

655
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,140
 Here's what I mean.

656
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,860
 The law said, if you steal, you give exactly back,

657
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,460
 like, if you steal 100 bucks, you give $100 back,

658
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,100
 and 1/5 of what you stole.

659
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,380
 So if you steal $100, you give back 100, plus $20.

660
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,380
 Zacchaeus says, I'm giving back $500.

661
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,780
 I'm going way above the law.

662
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,740
 This isn't about law, this is about love.

663
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,660
 I've met a person who changed me.

664
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,940
 He changed me from a greedy person to a generous person,

665
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,140
 and everything changed.

666
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,220
 There's no part of your story

667
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,660
 that if you and I will allow God to step in,

668
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,820
 he will not use and change to be a ministry for him.

669
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,460
 I mean, honestly, this is how he works all the time.

670
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,940
 So many of the ministries at Watermark

671
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,980
 are people who blew it,

672
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,900
 or people who were sinned against,

673
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,560
 and all kinds of pain was a part of their life,

674
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,460
 and in the midst of that, they turned to God,

675
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,900
 and they said, God, this is where I'm a broken person,

676
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,140
 but I trust in you.

677
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,260
 You're the God who comes into broken people's lives,

678
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,860
 and you change them, you take a mess,

679
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,020
 and you make it a ministry.

680
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,700
 I mean, MEND.

681
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,140
 MEND is a ministry for men

682
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,880
 who've been experienced sexual abuse.

683
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,220
 They've come in, and they just said, look, God,

684
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,060
 this is all the brokenness here, will you use it?

685
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,220
 And a guy who had experienced sexual abuse

686
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,160
 started that ministry.

687
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,420
 Someone Cares was started by a girl who said,

688
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,740
 hey, I had an abortion, it was part of my past.

689
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,320
 I want you to take God, if you will, my mess,

690
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,480
 and will you turn it and use it for ministry?

691
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,040
 All over the place, region, region.

692
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,120
 The people who run region were suicidal,

693
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,200
 alcoholics, had a shotgun in my mouth.

694
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,980
 I met Jesus, and everything changed.

695
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,320
 Every single direction you look,

696
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,160
 all over this place, there's stories

697
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:17,160
 of people who said, God, I'm bringing you my mess,

698
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,640
 and you're the God who takes messes,

699
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,820
 and you make it a ministry.

700
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,120
 Will you do that here?

701
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,080
 And whatever your story is,

702
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,640
 that's exactly what he wants to do with you.

703
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,360
 Whatever that part of you that you're like,

704
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,780
 man, I just can't, I've never told anybody this.

705
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:38,520
 Whatever that part of you that you're like, I hate.

706
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,460
 I don't know if it's like this thing,

707
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,580
 that it's alcoholism, maybe it's cutting,

708
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,780
 maybe it's an eating disorder,

709
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,560
 maybe it's same-sex attraction, whatever it is,

710
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,880
 there's no part of your past that God can't take

711
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,540
 and make a platform for his power.

712
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,200
 If we just surrender and hand it over to him,

713
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,840
 and just like in Zacchaeus' case,

714
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,580
 he takes messes and makes a ministry out of it.

715
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:07,240
 Personally, I've experienced firsthand

716
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,880
 the pain of outside circumstances,

717
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,400
 which maybe that's part of your story in the room.

718
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,940
 You're like, I was, maybe you experienced sexual abuse,

719
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,760
 or maybe you experienced divorce of a parent,

720
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,900
 and maybe you experienced just something in a job

721
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,160
 where you were robbed by somebody around you.

722
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,120
 In my own story, personally, I felt the pains

723
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,920
 and feel the scars of having a father that wasn't around.

724
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,840
 And you know what's weird?

725
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,600
 It's like that over and over again,

726
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,320
 God uses me to have a voice or a microphone

727
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,400
 into the lives of people who, just like me,

728
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,560
 did not have a father around.

729
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,120
 That he takes this father wound

730
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,360
 and through the body of Christ, works in it, heals in it,

731
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,880
 and brings about an opportunity to just say,

732
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
 hey, this is what I'm walking through.

733
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,600
 'Cause honestly, all over the room, I mean, 50%,

734
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,880
 we are the fatherless generation.

735
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,160
 And in my story, that's what he's done.

736
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,240
 He's used that.

737
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,400
 There's girls on our staff,

738
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,680
 one of the best ministers of the gospel I know,

739
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,400
 abortion was part of her story.

740
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,120
 She didn't hide it, she didn't hold it back.

741
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,240
 She brought it to the Lord, and everything changed.

742
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,440
 She ministers to women week in and week out

743
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,160
 who have that a part of their story.

744
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,460
 And you may be in the room thinking,

745
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,520
 man, well, I did not have a rebellious stage in life.

746
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,720
 I mean, what is my ministry?

747
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,200
 What is my testimony that I can just say,

748
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,880
 hey, this is how God worked?

749
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,900
 That is the best testimony in the room.

750
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,740
 Like that is, if you're the person who says,

751
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,240
 hey, I was raised in church,

752
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,480
 I never really had that season

753
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,600
 where I ran away from Christ,

754
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,120
 like God in his grace protected me.

755
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,840
 That is the testimony that all across this country,

756
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,160
 really our world, people are praying that people would have.

757
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,200
 If that's your story, you have nothing to be ashamed of,

758
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,320
 you have everything to be proud of

759
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,680
 because God, he didn't need to show you how bitter sin was

760
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,200
 for you to know how sweet it is to know Jesus.

761
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,920
 You just believed it and you trusted

762
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,360
 and experienced the sweetness of God.

763
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,540
 I pray that my son has that testimony.

764
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,360
 Everyone on our staff prays that their children

765
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,200
 would have that.

766
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,540
 Every person in the world's like,

767
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,080
 they're like, man, I wish that I had a crazy testimony

768
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,480
 that was like strippers and drugs and sex and rock and roll.

769
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,400
 But if my children, I definitely don't.

770
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,640
 And the person that I marry,

771
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,440
 I'd like them to be a little more straight laced too.

772
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,440
 And so everyone, nobody's like, oh, that's a,

773
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,000
 if that's your story, you have an amazing testimony,

774
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,600
 the best testimony of God's grace.

775
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,800
 And that's your opportunity to use that microphone

776
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,880
 and say, man, God protected me.

777
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,460
 I've walked with him.

778
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,060
 I've seen and tasted that the Lord is good.

779
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,060
 I don't need to eat vomit or dog poop to know it's not good.

780
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,040
 I believe that it wasn't good

781
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,240
 when everybody else was eating the,

782
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,040
 what a weird illustration, dog poop.

783
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,240
 (congregation laughing)

784
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,560
 And that is your ministry.

785
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,120
 And Zacchaeus ate the dog poop.

786
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,680
 (congregation laughing)

787
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,840
 That's not true at all.

788
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,280
 But whatever your story is in this room and in Fort Worth

789
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,720
 and in Houston and downtown, God wants to take it

790
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,760
 and use it to minister all the parts,

791
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,840
 all the dark parts, all the light parts,

792
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,800
 to minister for him.

793
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,840
 And that's exactly what happened.

794
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,080
 And here's Jesus' response as we close up.

795
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,600
 And Jesus said to him,

796
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,760
 all right, Zacchaeus, we're gonna wait a few weeks

797
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,160
 and see if this really sticks,

798
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,800
 'cause I'm not really sure that this is a genuine conversion

799
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,640
 Senator always said.

800
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,560
 Here's what he says.

801
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:36,560
 Today, salvation has come to this house

802
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,880
 because this man too is a son of Abraham.

803
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,080
 In other words, this man too

804
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,840
 is a child of God's covenant family.

805
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,480
 This man too is a child of God, you could say.

806
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,560
 For the son of man,

807
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,200
 which is Jesus' favorite title for himself,

808
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,760
 came to seek and to save the lost.

809
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,400
 That in response to Zac, Jesus says salvation has come,

810
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,960
 personifies salvation.

811
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,320
 And it's like it showed up at this house

812
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,480
 and he's a child of Abraham.

813
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,600
 But it didn't come through him trying harder.

814
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,880
 It came through him encountering a person.

815
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,640
 Like the third idea from this text,

816
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,520
 if you take notes, you run it on third point here,

817
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,080
 is that we don't need a second chance.

818
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,340
 We need a savior.

819
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,860
 The message to all humanity,

820
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,640
 the message that Zacchaeus responded to

821
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,800
 and everything changed was not,

822
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,480
 hey, if you try a little harder, Zacchaeus,

823
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,400
 here's a new law, here's a new principle,

824
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,120
 here's a new thing to adopt, then God will accept you.

825
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,200
 He didn't need a second chance or a third chance.

826
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,120
 He needed a savior.

827
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,920
 And when he encountered that savior, which was a person,

828
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,800
 everything changed.

829
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,880
 Another way of saying this is Jesus personifies,

830
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,880
 man, I love this.

831
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,680
 He says salvation came to this house.

832
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,840
 Wait a second, Jesus, you came to the house.

833
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,660
 Salvation came to the house.

834
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:01,800
 Salvation has a name, Jesus.

835
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,880
 In other words, salvation does not come through a process.

836
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,160
 And listen to me very closely

837
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,520
 because a lot of you in the room

838
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,840
 were raised in denominations or church beliefs

839
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,280
 or maybe religious expressions

840
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,240
 where you were not taught this.

841
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,800
 You were taught that salvation comes through a process,

842
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,640
 that it comes through keeping some sacraments

843
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,400
 or doing this prayer a certain amount of times

844
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,000
 or doing a certain amount of actions that God will love you

845
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,640
 if you do over 50%.

846
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,680
 The Bible teaches salvation does not come through a process.

847
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,560
 It comes through a person.

848
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,400
 That person has a name, Jesus.

849
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,440
 And if you're ever gonna encounter the living God,

850
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,040
 if you're ever going to spend,

851
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,520
 if you're ever gonna spend eternity with God,

852
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,880
 it will not happen through you adopting a process,

853
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,920
 through you keeping a certain number of sacraments,

854
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,720
 through you doing a certain number of good deeds.

855
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,840
 It will happen the day that you encounter a person

856
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,840
 named Jesus, a Savior,

857
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,360
 who didn't come to give a second chance

858
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,320
 so that you could try harder.

859
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,880
 He came to save you and to save me.

860
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,680
 And just like Zacchaeus, who was undeserving,

861
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,920
 who was broken,

862
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,280
 who was anyone that did not deserve God's love,

863
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,300
 it would be him.

864
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,960
 Jesus shows up

865
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,680
 and he says, "I'm coming to your house.

866
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,240
 "I'm coming to change you."

867
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,920
 If you ever have a relationship with God,

868
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,680
 it will happen in encountering the God

869
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,000
 who has come to you in the form of Jesus,

870
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,200
 not going through a process, but meeting a person,

871
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,800
 encountering a person.

872
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,760
 If you wanna have the righteousness that God requires,

873
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,840
 in other words, the Bible teaches that,

874
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,360
 and really all religions teach,

875
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,760
 in order to have a relationship with God,

876
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,000
 you gotta have righteousness.

877
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,640
 What makes Christianity different

878
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,100
 from every other religion is they all teach

879
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,680
 what other religions teach.

880
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,240
 Righteousness is something that we pile on

881
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,160
 and we bring to God.

882
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,000
 And God, I'm gonna do this,

883
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,840
 I'm gonna do a little bit more of this,

884
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,660
 and I'm gonna do a little,

885
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,640
 and here I'm bringing you my righteousness.

886
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,180
 Christianity teaches righteousness

887
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,000
 is something God brings to you,

888
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,460
 that God brings to Christians,

889
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,720
 that it's not something you earn,

890
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,540
 it is something that a person named Jesus

891
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,080
 shows up and delivers.

892
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,400
 Salvation is not in a process,

893
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,520
 but it's found in a person,

894
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,740
 and in encountering that person, everything changes.

895
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,980
 That's when change begins to happen.

896
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,820
 Just like in,

897
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,520
 when I got married,

898
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,780
 all of a sudden, I like encountered this person

899
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,420
 and everything began to change.

900
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,420
 Like I was 25, I got married,

901
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,180
 her name was Callie, still is,

902
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,560
 and it hadn't changed.

903
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,500
 And all of a sudden, like we got married

904
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,740
 and everything changed.

905
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,060
 We went from like, oh, I'm living in this,

906
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,880
 you know, kind of corner of this house

907
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,060
 with like eight other guys,

908
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,060
 to oh, no, we have to have our own place.

909
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,140
 And all of a sudden, not only where I live changed,

910
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,420
 but like the things inside of my home,

911
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,860
 we got these things called decorations.

912
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,620
 And then we got things like called like a candle,

913
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,020
 like what's a candle, you light it.

914
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,720
 And then everything that we,

915
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,460
 the way that I ate changed.

916
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,300
 The way that it's like,

917
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,360
 hey, you can't eat that every night.

918
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,140
 The way that the TV shows that we watched,

919
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,660
 it was like, we're not watching ESPN at all.

920
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,060
 Things around us, and the futon is not coming in our home.

921
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,860
 All these different things on like how I slept,

922
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,380
 where I lived, everything began to change

923
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,920
 because I encountered a person.

924
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,740
 And in the same way, that's what Christianity is.

925
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,800
 It's not a principle.

926
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,680
 It's not you encountering a new law.

927
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,260
 It's encountering a person named Jesus.

928
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,140
 And the day you encounter him,

929
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,340
 the day you begin to walk with him

930
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,180
 is the day that everything changes.

931
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,460
 For some of us in the room,

932
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,540
 and I'll close here and give kind of application,

933
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,980
 and we'll close with a story.

934
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,340
 I think some of you here tonight is your night,

935
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,460
 and you need to accept the acceptance

936
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,720
 that God is offering to you.

937
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,260
 Like some of you in the room, just like Zacchaeus,

938
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,420
 you think that if God's looking down at you,

939
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,740
 either he's pleased with you, like, hey, God does love me

940
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,540
 'cause I've been a pretty good person,

941
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,620
 and I'm trying to do good,

942
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,980
 and I'm trying to keep things together.

943
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,980
 And the message for you tonight is your night

944
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,640
 to accept that you are not a good person.

945
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,100
 The Bible doesn't even teach that good people go to heaven

946
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,620
 and bad people go to hell.

947
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,780
 It teaches forgiven people go to heaven.

948
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,920
 And the only way to get forgiven

949
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,220
 is by putting your faith in Jesus,

950
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:14,140
 trusting that Jesus on the cross paid for your sin.

951
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:18,220
 And he offers a free gift to anyone who will accept it.

952
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,980
 That, hey, I will cover, I've covered your sin.

953
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,260
 The check cleared, I rose from the dead,

954
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,940
 showing the payment was more than enough.

955
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,820
 And anyone who will just accept that message

956
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,980
 will have eternal life.

957
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,620
 And the message for you tonight is will you accept it?

958
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,740
 That is the question that remains for all mankind,

959
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,060
 is not has God and would God accept them?

960
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,120
 It is he already has,

961
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,100
 but have they accepted his free gift on the cross,

962
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,660
 dying in their place?

963
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,040
 And tonight is your night.

964
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,500
 Regardless of where you're sitting,

965
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,420
 regardless of where you are, if you're listening online,

966
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,380
 if you're listening in Houston, tonight is your night

967
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,540
 where you don't have to wonder anymore

968
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,620
 how God feels about you.

969
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,660
 You don't have to wonder anymore

970
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,020
 where you're gonna spend eternity with.

971
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,980
 You don't have to wonder anymore

972
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,320
 if you die on your way home tonight,

973
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,720
 which God forbid happen.

974
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,240
 But you can have peace, rest,

975
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,720
 in the fact that Jesus on the cross paid for it.

976
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,920
 If you'll just accept it, what does that look like?

977
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,900
 It means trusting that Jesus paid for your sin.

978
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,580
 That when it comes to everything that you've ever done,

979
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,760
 God, you paid for it.

980
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,080
 You did away with it.

981
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,920
 You paid for it.

982
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,740
 I didn't deserve it.

983
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,160
 I'm not deserving.

984
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,280
 But I need a savior because I'm a sinner.

985
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,720
 And in light of that, despite everything that I've done,

986
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,360
 you loved me enough to pay for it.

987
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,600
 And tonight, if in a moment of faith,

988
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,980
 if you say, I believe that, not just say the words,

989
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,440
 but you believe it in your heart, everything will change.

990
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,920
 Your eternity will change.

991
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,420
 Your life like Zacchaeus will begin to change.

992
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,440
 Many of us in the room have experienced it firsthand.

993
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,980
 And it all begins in that moment of accepting the God

994
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,080
 who's already accepted you,

995
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,780
 who's already reaching out to you.

996
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,960
 A lot of times people will pray a prayer in their seat,

997
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,840
 wherever you are.

998
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,320
 It's not a prayer that saves you.

999
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,740
 It is believing and trusting your savior that saves you.

1000
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,320
 And if you're in the room tonight, tonight is your night.

1001
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,760
 And we wanna talk to you afterwards,

1002
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,600
 if we can lead you through what that looks like.

1003
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,640
 Do not leave this room.

1004
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,400
 There's no decision that will matter more

1005
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,300
 for all of eternity than that one.

1006
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,960
 And for those of us in the room who have accepted it,

1007
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,040
 we have this amazing opportunity and responsibility

1008
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,260
 to now go extend it,

1009
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,640
 to extend it to a world that's full of Zacchaeuses

1010
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,120
 like you and I, who never deserved it,

1011
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,240
 who don't still deserve it.

1012
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,880
 And yet God, despite all of that,

1013
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,040
 is the God who says, "I'm gonna put the ball back on the tee

1014
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,140
 "out of my love for you,

1015
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,040
 "despite everything you've done or do."

1016
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,480
 That's the God who is there.

1017
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,480
 And that's why we take, that's why we do ministry.

1018
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,700
 That's why we do everything that we do.

1019
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,320
 It's why we're downtown right now.

1020
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,840
 We're trying to reach the city of Dallas,

1021
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,960
 reach the city of Houston,

1022
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,200
 reach a world who is bought into this lie

1023
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,720
 that I'm convinced is the best lie

1024
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,080
 that Satan's ever told.

1025
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,320
 That if you're a good person,

1026
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:04,120
 then God's gonna like you more than if you're a bad person.

1027
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,580
 And so just be a good person.

1028
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,760
 And it's a lie.

1029
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,920
 It's a lie, and to use extreme language, from hell.

1030
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,600
 And anyone who buys into it

1031
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,920
 will not spend eternity with their Savior.

1032
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,760
 And we have a responsibility and opportunity now

1033
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,920
 to go extend this amazing free gift,

1034
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,680
 this message that God has accepted

1035
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,940
 all those who will accept his free gift.

1036
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:35,640
 I'll close here because I think for many of us

1037
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,560
 in the room, we have, and what Jesus says to Zacchaeus

1038
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,460
 is that you're a child of God.

1039
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,400
 And yet all throughout the portraits

1040
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,920
 that we've looked at the past few weeks,

1041
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,280
 when it comes to the story of Zacchaeus,

1042
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,640
 when it comes to the story of really Jesus

1043
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,780
 and the narrative we see inside of the Bible,

1044
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,960
 I think there's a lot of us that struggle to believe

1045
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,800
 that God could be as good as he is.

1046
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,160
 That he looks at me and he sees me like a child,

1047
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,680
 that God really does look at you right now

1048
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,400
 and look at you just like a child, like his child.

1049
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,080
 And all the emotions and all the care

1050
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,520
 and all the ways that that plays itself out on earth

1051
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,280
 only to a times 10 degree

1052
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,740
 is the way that God feels about you and me.

1053
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,760
 Like here's one example.

1054
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,720
 This past week, my son, who's eight months old,

1055
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,680
 his name's Crew, he started crawling.

1056
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,720
 He's crawling around the house.

1057
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,040
 It's awesome because it's a race to see

1058
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,920
 versus all your other kids or all your friends

1059
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,240
 who have kids the same age who crawls first.

1060
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,440
 And so we're winning and that's not true.

1061
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,500
 He's crawling around the house.

1062
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,760
 He's beginning to do this next phase where he stands up

1063
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,520
 and he picks up, he'll pull up.

1064
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,360
 It's awesome.

1065
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,880
 And he'll begin to like try to move

1066
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,560
 and he'll take a step and he'll take a step.

1067
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,400
 And all of a sudden he'll like hands off

1068
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,920
 and he'll take one step and it's like,

1069
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,520
 oh my gosh, look at him, he's walking.

1070
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,480
 And we're of course like first time parents, we're freaked.

1071
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,520
 Are you getting this on camera?

1072
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,800
 Is this on camera right now?

1073
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,640
 Are you serious?

1074
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,480
 It's not working, pull it up.

1075
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,880
 Oh, he fell, oh my gosh.

1076
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,040
 So we're trying to document all this.

1077
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,640
 It's amazing, we're going crazy.

1078
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,320
 Like our son, he's taking a step.

1079
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,320
 And then all of a sudden like he'll fall.

1080
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,640
 Like it happens over and over and it's like he's fall.

1081
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,240
 And you know how to don't go, I'm not like,

1082
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,520
 oh man, I can't, unbelievable, man.

1083
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,040
 (audience laughing)

1084
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,960
 This is, delete the video, this is ridiculous.

1085
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,400
 Are you serious?

1086
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,720
 It's not that hard, buddy.

1087
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,000
 Look at me, I've been doing it for years.

1088
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,480
 (audience laughing)

1089
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,640
 No, it's not what you do.

1090
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,560
 You go, hey, it's okay, it's okay.

1091
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,200
 Here we go, are we gonna try again?

1092
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,600
 And he takes a step and you're like,

1093
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,480
 that's my boy, he just took a step, this is unbelievable.

1094
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,280
 When he does like nothing, when he falls on the ground,

1095
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,480
 you're like, it was a leaning step, this is amazing.

1096
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,120
 (audience laughing)

1097
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,680
 The portrait that the Bible tells us about Jesus,

1098
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,480
 the portrait the Bible gives us about God

1099
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,480
 is that God is not a father who goes,

1100
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,120
 unbelievable, really, you fell again?

1101
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,040
 You tripped and fell?

1102
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
 Oh my gosh, it's not that hard.

1103
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,680
 Look at me, I'm amazing, I'm perfect Jesus.

1104
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,000
 You can't do this.

1105
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,480
 But he looks down at his children

1106
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,880
 and in the same way that a father just goes crazy,

1107
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,480
 like I don't want you to fall,

1108
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,360
 I don't want you to get hurt, my son, me,

1109
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,440
 I don't want him to fall and hit his head.

1110
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,880
 I don't want him to get hurt, all those things.

1111
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,740
 But at the same time, my love for him

1112
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,600
 doesn't go up and down.

1113
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,920
 When he does, I rush and I pick him up

1114
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,480
 and I celebrate like crazy.

1115
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,840
 He took steps, he's walking.

1116
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,600
 He took a step and Jesus, God in a bod,

1117
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,920
 God himself, when he looks down at you and me

1118
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,480
 at the same way that he doesn't rejoice when you stumble,

1119
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,040
 he doesn't get caught up there and he celebrates

1120
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,840
 when his children are taking steps and walking with him.

1121
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,520
 Some of you in the room, you need to know that

1122
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,640
 because you're so caught up and you may think like,

1123
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,960
 Zacchaeus thought individually that,

1124
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,360
 God, I'm just such a failure.

1125
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,920
 I'm so, I fall all the time, God.

1126
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,280
 Could you really love me?

1127
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,480
 And he looks at you like a father with their child.

1128
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,240
 That's the picture we're given.

1129
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,720
 In fact, at one point, Jesus even says,

1130
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,420
 hey, God's relationship is like a father with a child,

1131
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,040
 even though you guys are evil fathers, is what he says.

1132
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,720
 He says, God, who is a perfect loving father,

1133
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,800
 is like that with his children and he looks at you

1134
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,360
 and he celebrates when you take those steps,

1135
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,400
 he celebrates when you move in his direction

1136
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,800
 and he goes, that's my girl.

1137
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,520
 That's my girl who's walking with me.

1138
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,880
 That's my girl who's dating the way that I want her to.

1139
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,320
 Man, she fell down today, but she's gonna get back up.

1140
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,720
 We're gonna pick her back up.

1141
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,640
 That's my boy.

1142
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,320
 And he looks at you with eyes of a loving father

1143
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,640
 and the same hands that reached out to Zacchaeus

1144
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,840
 and changed his life,

1145
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:45,600
 the same heart that desires to seek out

1146
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,800
 those who are far from God is the same heart

1147
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,480
 that is crazy about you

1148
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,040
 and wants you to know him if you don't

1149
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,720
 and wants you to know how much he loves you if you do

1150
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,080
 and really regardless

1151
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,800
 and wants you to know how much he celebrates when you walk,

1152
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,100
 when you just take a step.

1153
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,860
 I'm gonna pray that that would mark our lives.

1154
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,540
 The perspective that Jesus gives us

1155
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,100
 all throughout this series,

1156
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,700
 that we would encounter Jesus

1157
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,620
 because everything changes then

1158
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,340
 for Zacchaeus, for me, and for you.

1159
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,180
 Let me pray.

1160
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:29,780
 God, I can't even get my mind around the idea

1161
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,900
 that you love us like a father with their child.

1162
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,540
 That you love us enough not just in the ways

1163
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,540
 that you don't just love us because we behave, Father.

1164
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,180
 You love us despite knowing every way that we haven't,

1165
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,500
 every way that we don't,

1166
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,020
 so much that you'll say, "I'll die in their place."

1167
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,940
 I'm crazy about 'em.

1168
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,660
 And I know in this room, there are men and women

1169
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,540
 who don't know and don't believe that.

1170
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:58,380
 And so, Lord, would you do what only you can do,

1171
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,900
 which is would you grab their heart?

1172
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,300
 Would you win in their heart?

1173
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,060
 Would you win in their heart?

1174
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:10,540
 For those who don't believe that they need a Savior,

1175
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,220
 don't believe that they're as messed up as Zacchaeus,

1176
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,060
 would you win in their heart, Father?

1177
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,660
 For those who right now see themselves as that Zacchaeus

1178
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,420
 and they're going, "God, could you love me?"

1179
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,540
 And I know they're gonna come up after this message

1180
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,660
 and they're still buying into that lie

1181
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,940
 that God's love for them is based on what they do

1182
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,260
 or what they haven't done.

1183
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,460
 Would you pierce through with the truth, Father,

1184
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:38,100
 of who you are, of your love for us?

1185
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,660
 And would you win tonight?

1186
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,460
 Would you win more of our hearts,

1187
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:45,300
 win more of those souls that are in this room?

1188
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,580
 Father, we love you, we thank you for Jesus,

1189
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:50,340
 our ultimate victory, amen.
