[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.680]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.840]   >> All right. What's up everybody in the room,
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.800]   everybody tuning in online in particular?
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.120]   The rowdy crew over here.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.240]   I want to welcome PortsLive locations everywhere in
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.360]   particular Fort Worth, Austin, Texas, greater Lafayette,
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.600]   Indianapolis, Midland, Texas, every PortsLive location.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.280]   We are starting a brand new series tonight that I am so
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.880]   excited about, and it will be looking at the book of
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.640]   Ephesians. Now, let me bring you into something that
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.280]   happened last week in my life that will set up where I
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.080]   want to go tonight. I was on vacation with my family.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.960]   We went with my wife's family to the beach and where we
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.560]   were staying had the Cowboys training camp located there
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.160]   as well. And so one of the days I talked to my six-year-old
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.080]   son and my four-year-old daughter, and I was like, the
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.840]   Dallas Cowboys are here. They're down the road. We can
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.320]   go to the training camp and go see the Dallas Cowboys. Do
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.280]   you guys want to go do that? And it's all free and they're
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.240]   going to have tons of fun stuff to do. Y'all want to go?
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.640]   And eventually by telling them there will be snow cones,
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.120]   they're like, I'm in. So we get in the car, pack up, drive
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.120]   an hour, get there and everything looks great. Get to
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.720]   the bleachers and immediately in front of us, I mean like
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.440]   50 feet away is Dallas Cowboys. It's amazing. There's
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.560]   Dak, there's Zeke, everybody. They're running two minute
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.360]   drills. I mean, here's a picture of how close you are.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.640]   And I'm thinking, man, this is going to be a memory my
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.120]   kids remember for the rest of their life. Dad was there
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.920]   where they're watching Dallas Cowboys out in California.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.640]   It's just incredible. And I turned to my kids and I can
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.800]   tell, man, they are not into it at all. They are ready to
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.400]   go. My six year old. Yeah, there's my daughter who this
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.160]   is like five minutes in after she's taken my father in
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.400]   law's sunglasses and my son's taking the other pair of
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.920]   sunglasses in his hat. And they're like, it's too bright.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.400]   This is miserable. No, no, no. That's Dak. See the red
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.600]   jersey. That's the quarterback. You need to know him.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.560]   Watch this play. All right, man, he's running that route.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.600]   And they're like, man, I'm so over it. When are we getting
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.880]   the snow cones? And I keep going, OK, hey, all right,
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.280]   let's watch a few more plays. And I'm trying to hype it
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.800]   up. And I'm realizing they don't know who this is.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.280]   They're like, wait, is this our team? Why are they out
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.760]   in California if they're from Dallas? And is this like
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.840]   do they play the Aggies or the Miami Heat? Do they play
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.840]   Miami Heat? I'm like, no, no, that's basketball.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.640]   And that's the NBA. This is the NFL. No, they don't play
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.560]   college teams. This is the National Football League.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.840]   And I'm like, this is going to be a memory. This is so
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.480]   exciting. And they were over it before it began.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.880]   True story. I go to get snow cones because I'm like, I
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.640]   got to do something to redeem this. Stay with Grandpa.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.000]   Grandpa calls me five minutes later and is like, I think
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.880]   they're done. Let's get the snow cones and leave. And we
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.400]   get the snow cones and they head off. Now, in that
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.880]   scenario, one of the reasons they were not able to stay
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.720]   engaged is they didn't know what they were looking at.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.840]   They didn't know who these people were. I can try to
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.680]   explain, but without having a clear understanding of,
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.120]   hey, this is who this is. It was more difficult to stay
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.160]   engaged and more difficult to connect with what was in
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.240]   front of them. Now, tonight, we're going to kick off a
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.440]   look at the book of Ephesians and my heart and hope in
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.400]   the next 45 minutes or 30 minutes is to walk through
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.800]   and help you better understand who's in front of you
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.720]   as it relates to the church in Ephesus. In other words,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.640]   tonight, before we dive into the book, I want to give
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.200]   you the ability to understand when we talk about the
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.120]   letter to the Ephesians, it's like, oh, you know, the
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.800]   Colossians and the Galatians and the Ephesians and the
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.280]   ends. But who is the church in Ephesus? And what I
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.120]   want to do tonight is trace the origin and the ending
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.120]   of the church in Ephesus to give us really a framework
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.720]   to understand what we're going to look at for the
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.560]   next eight to 10 weeks as we go through and journey
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.720]   through this book. The church in Ephesus is one of
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.720]   the most remarkable stories and churches of the
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.280]   ancient world and in history in general. And tonight,
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.880]   when we look at the story in Acts, chapter 18 and 19,
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.760]   we're going to see the beginning of the church and
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.200]   also how the spirit began to give clarity. On
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.320]   different types of faith. That were present in the
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.240]   church of Ephesus, there was a group that had a
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.600]   flawed, inaccurate faith. There was another group
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   that had a fake faith and then a final group that
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.480]   had a faith that brought freedom into their life, a
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.960]   genuine faith. And so this is going to be a tracing
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.440]   of the beginning and the end of the Ephesian church.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.120]   And here's what you need to know about Ephesian
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.320]   church. It was located in Ephesus. Today, that's
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.280]   modern day Turkey. Ephesus was an amazing city. It
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.200]   was a port city. It was a climate very similar to
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.320]   like L.A. Here's a picture of today. If you go to
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.760]   the port of Ephesus, I mean, it's like tropical.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.600]   It's amazing. It's 75 almost year round. That's
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.280]   why I say it's similar to like L.A. I mean, this
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.760]   is a place people wanted to be back then because it
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.920]   was on a port. It was incredibly wealthy. This is a
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.320]   place you move to in order to run a business in
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.720]   order to have trade. You could make it in Ephesus.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.040]   And so people flooded to the city. It was one of
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.760]   the most populated cities of the ancient world. It
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.800]   also was a place that had lots of worship of pagan
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.480]   gods and lots of spirituality. There were 50
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.840]   different gods that were worshipped inside of the
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.200]   city of Ephesus. And perhaps the most important
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.240]   iconic thing about the city is located inside of
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.360]   the city was one of the seven wonders of the
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.120]   ancient world that there were kind of seven
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.000]   things historians go like, hey, we have no idea
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.600]   how this was built. It was a marvel today. And it
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.240]   was a marvel to everyone who lived back then. And
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.920]   it was called the Temple of Diana or the Temple
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.680]   of Artemis, who is the goddess of fertility. This
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.240]   was a massive thing. I think we have another
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.560]   picture. There you go. This would have been a
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.520]   reconstruction of it back in the day, but it was
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.080]   400 feet wide. It was 150 feet. I'm sorry, 450
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.360]   feet long, 150 feet wide, 60 feet tall, all
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.840]   worshipping this pagan goddess. And the apostle
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.200]   Paul is going to show up and he's going to
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.640]   introduce into this incredibly influential city.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.600]   The Christian faith and God is going to touch that
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.320]   movement in that city and in particular Paul's
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.840]   ministry like no other location, arguably in the
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.520]   entire New Testament. The apostle Paul would spend
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.520]   more time in this city than any other place that
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.000]   he would go. He loved the Church of Ephesus. And
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.800]   we know more about the Church of Ephesus than
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.000]   every other church in the New Testament. We know
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.440]   how it began. We know how it continued because
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.960]   the letters of first Timothy and second Timothy
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.560]   are written to Timothy, who was leading the
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.360]   church in Ephesus. The leaders of the church in
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.880]   Ephesus were remarkable. I mean, they had the
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.960]   who's who in terms of the Hall of Fame. Who's
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.200]   going to lead your church? Why do I say that?
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.720]   Well, it included the apostle Paul. It included
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.160]   the apostle John. It included Timothy. I mean,
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.000]   whatever church you've been to or been a part of,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.120]   you have not been to anything like a church
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.360]   where, oh, man, your your church is led by Paul.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.960]   Oh, man, who is Paul mentored by? Jesus. Oh,
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.480]   yeah. And then it was led by John. Who's John?
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.600]   Jesus. And God is going to do something
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   remarkable inside of this city. And the message
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.160]   of its origin are as relevant to us today as
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.600]   ever. And so we're going to be in Acts chapter
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.440]   18 and 19. And I want to look at three aspects
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.840]   of this faith and answer the question or propose
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.520]   the question. What kind of faith do you have? What
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.040]   kind of faith do you have? Perhaps no question
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:01.440]   is as important as that one. In evaluating, do I
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.440]   really have a true faith that's going to impact
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.440]   my eternity? What kind of faith do I have? So
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.440]   this starts in Acts chapter 18. Pick it up in
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:18.640]   verse 24. OK. Big fan of the number 24.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:26.120]   Meanwhile, a Jew named Apollos, a native of
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.400]   Alexandria, came to Ephesus. So the book of Acts
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.480]   is the story of the early church. So it traces
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.680]   Paul's journey. It traces kind of after Jesus
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.040]   rises from the dead, the church movement. And in
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.400]   18, it begins to talk about Ephesus. Apollos
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.960]   came to Ephesus. He was a learning man, thorough
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.600]   knowledge of the scriptures. He'd been instructed
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.160]   in the way of the Lord. That's Christianity. And
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.760]   he spoke with great fervor and he taught about
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.120]   Jesus accurately, though he only knew of the
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.000]   baptism of John. He began to speak boldly in the
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.040]   synagogue when Priscilla and Aquila, this is a
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.360]   married couple. They're mentioned earlier in Acts.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.560]   This is like married goals. They see him and they
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.760]   invite him into their home and they explain the
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.880]   way of God to him more adequately. So they see
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.400]   this guy, lots of passion, lots of energy,
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.920]   eloquent speaker. And he's talking about Jesus,
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.720]   but he doesn't fully understand it. And so
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.800]   Priscilla and Aquila, this married godly couple,
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.600]   they say, hey, Apollos, we're going to bring you
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.560]   over for dinner and we're going to teach you a
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.000]   better understanding of the gospel. And so they
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.160]   do. And then Apollos wants to go to Corinth or
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.800]   Achaia in verse 27. Apollos wanted to go to
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.560]   Achaia and the brothers and sisters, that's the
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.200]   church Christians around him, encouraged him and
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.160]   wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. When
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.040]   he arrived, he was a great help to those who by
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.040]   grace had believed. For he vigorously refuted the
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.200]   Jewish opponents in public debate, proving from
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.680]   the scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah. While
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.680]   Apollos was in Corinth, so Apollos was doing that,
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.880]   Paul took the road through the interior and
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.600]   arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   and he asked them, did you receive the Holy
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.160]   Spirit when you believed? They answered, no, we've
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.600]   not even heard there is a Holy Spirit. So Paul
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.280]   asked, then what baptism did you receive? They
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.160]   said John's baptism. Basically, we believed in
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.240]   the message that John the Baptist had preached.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:29.160]   Paul said John's baptism was that of repentance,
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.120]   of hey, you need to stop sinning, turn from the
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.280]   way you've been living. But it wasn't a fulfilled
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.840]   gospel. It wasn't the full picture. He told the
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.040]   people to believe or to trust in the one coming
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.880]   after him, that is in Jesus. On hearing them, on
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.040]   hearing this, they were baptized into the name of
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.080]   Jesus. In other words, they trusted in Christ and
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.360]   understood the gospel is not just something of
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.200]   hey, stop doing that. It is receive Jesus as your
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.720]   Lord and your Savior. The first group that were
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.040]   introduced, there's two really, there's a person
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.440]   and then there's a group that had a flawed faith,
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.520]   that the Apollos had a flawed faith. We're not
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.360]   told exactly how he had not rightly understood
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.000]   the gospel, but he had what many people still
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.680]   today have. He had a flawed understanding of what
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.240]   the Bible actually teaches. The second group is in
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.520]   the same camp. It's this group that had Paul
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.040]   telling them, no, no, no, no, no, that's not what
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.800]   Jesus means and that's not what it means to even
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.920]   be a follower of Christ. And so he explains.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.320]   Inside of this room and listening online, to
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.840]   some level, all of us have a flawed faith. But
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.720]   when it comes to having a flawed understanding
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:52.200]   of the gospel. That has ramifications that can
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.400]   impact your eternity. And Paul is trying to make
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.160]   sure, hey, you have an accurate understanding of
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.000]   who is God, of what's real, and that you address
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.640]   any flawed faith. Inside of the room today,
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.480]   there's still examples of flawed faith. The
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.520]   candle, you guys, maybe you grew up in church, you
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.400]   went through confirmation, you went to a Catholic
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.080]   school, you've been around Christianity a long
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.480]   time. Your grandma, you know, had verses on the
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.600]   wall and you just feel like you kind of know it.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.960]   But you still think things that are flawed and not
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.280]   biblical. What do I mean? Things like God is some
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.560]   cosmic killjoy who's up in the sky, doesn't want
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.680]   anyone having fun down here, and he doesn't want
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.920]   you to have sex or drink or smoke or do anything
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.720]   that's going to be too fun because he's just in a
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.240]   bad mood all the time. And he is one goal in life
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.280]   and it is to make sure nobody has too much fun.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.240]   And you wouldn't put it like that, but when you
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.520]   think of God, that's part of what you associate
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.200]   with him. Or you think that he's just some genie
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.680]   in the sky and really, you know, I go to him when
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.880]   things are hard or when I want something. It's a
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:02.360]   flawed faith. Or that he's some sheriff, distant
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.200]   judge, and he cares about me because he kind of
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.040]   loves the whole world, but he doesn't really love
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.880]   me. Certainly not like me, like I am.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.160]   And that's a flawed faith.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.160]   And the Bible calls all of us to take our lives
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.040]   and take the word of God and begin to go, hey,
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.280]   where am I believing a lie?
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.720]   Where am I living in a way that's not aligned
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.880]   with God's word? One of the gifts of having godly
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.440]   friends, relationships, community, older couples,
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.240]   is that just like Apollos, they can come along and
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.240]   they can go, hey, let me help you understand. It
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.360]   seems like you're believing this lie right now.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.800]   And to address any areas of our faith that are
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.320]   flawed. The whole book of Ephesians is really
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.040]   written where the apostle Paul is trying to help
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.640]   them. Hey, here's what it looks like to live out
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.920]   your faith. Here's how you can have a better
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.640]   understanding of who God is. Here's what it looks
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.440]   like to live out your faith. And in the book, he
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.400]   walks through one of the clearest outlines of any
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.440]   book that we have. And you can break the book
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.720]   down into really three sections. The first three
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.560]   chapters all about seated or sit. You are seated
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.840]   in the heavenly places, sealed for eternity if
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.200]   you're a follower of Jesus. Then four and five
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.200]   chapters, four and five, he talks about men walk
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.040]   in light of the new identity, the new you. That
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.880]   you are in Christ. Now you walk in a manner
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.920]   that's consistent with that. So sit, walk. And in
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.280]   chapter six, now stand firm in the faith. And it
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.080]   really takes us on the Christian journey that
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.800]   begins with understanding all those things. You're
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.000]   seated. And I'm going to walk consistent with
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.240]   that. And I'm going to stand firm in my faith. And
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.400]   what my heart and I hope you will journey with us
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.600]   for the next 10 weeks is we want to help you know
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.840]   how to read and study God's word for yourself. To
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.640]   begin to self examine any areas in your life where
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.640]   you are having flawed faith, a inaccurate,
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.080]   unbiblical perspective on life, on yourself, on
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.040]   God, and to address those things. You would begin
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.560]   to grow. That as we've said before, it is
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.480]   possible for you to grow in age. You're going to
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.280]   grow in age this year. You're getting older. It's
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.360]   a guarantee. You're 24, you're going to be 25 next
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.120]   year. You're 27, you're going to be 28 next year.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.840]   If you're alive, I guarantee it. It's not a
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.200]   guarantee that you're going to grow in your faith.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.600]   You're going to grow up in age, but not grow up
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.760]   spiritually. And Paul is saying, hey, addressing
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.720]   with God's word and growing spiritually in your
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.320]   faith. My six month old son, his name is Bear, and
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.640]   he recently had a milestone that he hit that I
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.960]   don't know if this is early or not. I can't
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.360]   honestly remember without other kids, but here's a
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.200]   picture of him. This is Bear. He just learned how
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.000]   to sit. Now to you, you're like, dude, I've been
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.800]   sitting my whole life. But whenever you are only
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.840]   six months old, like this is a big deal. He's got
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.240]   a head 99 percentile. So for most of his life, it's
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.880]   like, oh, boom. And now he can finally get to the
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.520]   spot where he's like stabilizing with those thick
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.560]   legs down there. And he's able to prop himself up,
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.160]   which is apparent. It's both a milestone and also
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.960]   a big win because it's kind of the first time
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.240]   you're like, all right, I can set you down and
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.960]   grab. Oh, no, he's going to fall. And before, if
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.120]   you step away for a second, he'd fall and now he
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.160]   can sit. Now, that's a milestone when you're six
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.200]   months old, but if he never progresses beyond
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.120]   sitting and he's six years old, it's not a
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.920]   milestone. It's a problem. And as lovingly as I can
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.560]   say. Some of you guys have been in church a long
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:34.840]   time. And you've been around Bible teaching. You
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.040]   were raised in a Christian home. And when it comes
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.200]   to spiritually in your faith, you have not
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.840]   progressed. And just like it is confusing when a
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.120]   six year old is not walking and taking steps in
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:57.640]   his faith. It is confusing. When a person who's
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.480]   been a follower of Christ for years and years and
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.600]   years is not taking steps and growing in their
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.920]   faith. And Paul is addressing, hey, there is a
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.800]   flawed perspective and the way you address that
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.600]   is by taking the truth from God's word. If you
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.600]   don't know how to do that, stay tuned, because we
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.160]   are going to journey through the verses of the
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.840]   book of Ephesians. So he addresses a flawed
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.960]   faith. And then in chapter 19, this happens.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.480]   Paul spent the next two years, verse 10, teaching
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.480]   and proclaiming the gospel to the point that all
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.880]   of the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province,
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.120]   that's just the state of Asia, heard the word of
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.080]   the Lord. That's what I mean by Paul's ministry
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.320]   was supercharged. So he spends more time there
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.120]   than anybody else spends two years. He's going
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.360]   to tell everybody about the gospel to the point
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.400]   where the text just said there wasn't a person in
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.280]   the entire state who hadn't heard the message of
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.960]   Jesus. God just opens doors, gives favor, Paul's
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.160]   out sharing his faith, and he supernaturally
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.480]   begins to work through the Apostle Paul, verse 19,
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.800]   or verse 11 of chapter 19. God did extraordinary
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.840]   miracles through Paul, so that even handkerchiefs
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.520]   and aprons that had touched him were taken to the
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.960]   sick and their illnesses were cured and evil
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:19.000]   spirits left them. So Paul's going around, God's
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.160]   doing amazing work, the church is growing, he's
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.560]   sharing the gospel, more believers are added to
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.960]   the group. And the word of this guy, there's a guy
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.560]   named Paul, he's in town and it's like crazy stuff
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.520]   is happening with him. He's seeing people come to
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.560]   know Jesus and he's sharing this message about
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.440]   Jesus and people's lives are being changed and
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.760]   like it's like demons are being cast out of
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.000]   demon-possessed people. I mean, stuff that today
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.560]   we don't even have a category for, but at that
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.280]   time there was a group that had heard about Paul
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.800]   doing this and they were like, man, that sounds
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.560]   awesome. I bet we could go do that. We could use
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.640]   the same God or use the name of Jesus. We're
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.000]   going to go do that. And it leads to one of the
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.680]   more comical, I think, interactions, honestly, in
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.360]   the New Testament. Here's where I say that or it'll
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.840]   make sense where I say it. Some of the Jews who
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.360]   went around driving out evil spirits tried to
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.760]   invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.240]   were demon-possessed. They would say, in the name
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.520]   of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, I command you to
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.280]   come out. So this group acts as, again, it's
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.120]   telling us what happened at the time. And it
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.920]   tells us this story. You know, Paul is going
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.960]   around. People are being healed. People are
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.000]   having demons cast out of them that were
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.880]   demon-possessed. And this group is like, oh, man,
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.560]   that was amazing. Did you see what he did? He
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.240]   cast him out in the name of Jesus. Let's try
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.920]   that. And they begin to go around and go to
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.120]   demon-possessed people and go, hey, in the name
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.880]   of Jesus, who Paul preaches, come out. And they
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.240]   go up to a certain guy and says this. There are
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.200]   seven sons of Sheba, a Jewish chief priest. So
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.680]   there was a Jewish priest who had seven sons and
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.840]   they were doing this. One day, as they were going
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.560]   up to a possessed person and commanding them to
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:06.360]   come out, the evil spirit answered them. This is
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.880]   what I mean by it's like out of a Pirates of the
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.040]   Caribbean experience. They're commanding it and
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.320]   it says that the possessed man turns to them and
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:19.480]   he says, Jesus, I know. And Paul, I know about.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:28.200]   But who are you? And the man who had the evil
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:33.760]   spirit jumped on them, overpowered them all and
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.760]   gave them such a beating that they ran out of the
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.920]   house naked and bleeding. You got seven guys
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.320]   going up saying, hey, in the name of Jesus, who
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.680]   Paul preaches, I command you to come out.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.920]   Demon-possessed man turns, says, I know about
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.320]   Jesus. I've heard of this guy, Paul. I don't know
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.200]   who you are. And they get into a fight, seven on
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.880]   one. And the seven brothers fighting this one
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:08.360]   man get so beaten that they reach an all time low
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.240]   in terms of loss. Like some of you guys, you were
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.720]   in fights, you've been in fights before, fights in
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.680]   high school, fights and whatever. And there's a
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.160]   level of, man, I lost that fight. And then there's
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.760]   times where it's like, man, I feel like that was
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.320]   kind of close. I got a couple of good ones in.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.840]   But when you and your six brothers get beaten so
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.840]   badly that you leave naked and bleeding, running
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.360]   out of the house, you're at a level of loss that
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.880]   there's very few words for in terms of who won
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.960]   that fight. It's not a, yeah, I had some good
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:38.520]   shots. And it's because they had a fake faith,
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:43.000]   like they claimed, in the name of Paul's God, come
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.760]   out. Now, most of us are not attempting to do
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.000]   something like that. But these were men who had
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.760]   been raised by a Jewish chief priest. They should
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.840]   have had some understanding or some faith. And
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.960]   they didn't even claim to know Jesus at all. They
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.040]   just claimed, hey, I know about him. I'm claiming
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.440]   Paul's relationship with Jesus. And they had a
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:09.800]   fake faith. The same is sadly true today. That in
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   the same way that they were claiming the faith of
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:19.760]   somebody else. To be their own, many people have
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.720]   that same thing happening in their life right now.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.520]   Like some of you guys, you've been around
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.280]   Christianity, like your grandma took you every
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.040]   Sunday to church, your mom took you Wednesday
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.120]   nights and you around it and your parents have a
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.720]   faith. You were raised and you say, I mean, I was
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.240]   raised in a Christian environment, but you've
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.240]   never made your faith your own. And if you were
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.440]   honest, which is really hard to do when it comes
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.280]   to examining a question like this. You have a fake
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.120]   faith. You've never even wondered like, hey, do I
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.240]   actually believe this? Do I really think that
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.240]   Jesus is who he says he is? Or am I just living
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.000]   off of the faith of other people that were around
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.680]   me? And, you know, I want to be a good person. And
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.040]   if I'm going to marry somebody that I want to
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.640]   marry, then, you know, I should claim to be a
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.280]   Christian. And I grew up in Dallas or I grew up in
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.480]   Arkansas or grew up in wherever. And it just is
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.600]   kind of the thing, it's cultural Christianity. And
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.520]   as lovingly as I can say, you have a fake faith.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:15.600]   And that doesn't save you. And you have got one
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.120]   foot in the world and one foot in the party scene.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:23.120]   And the way that Jesus commands you to date, the
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.720]   way that Jesus commands you to think, the way that
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.080]   Jesus invites you and calls you to experience life.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.920]   It's something you never think about. And you got
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.320]   a Bible verse in your Instagram bio, but you date
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:42.080]   anything like he says to date. And could it be,
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.760]   and I say this is lovingly and as someone who has
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.120]   no vested interest other than if that's true, I
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.080]   want you to spend eternity with God, not eternity
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.840]   apart from that you have a fake faith. You don't
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.560]   actually have a moment where you've ever trusted
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.200]   in Jesus. You are my Lord and Savior. You died on
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.040]   the cross for my sin. Everything messed up I've
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.800]   ever done, everything messed up I ever will do.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.920]   It's all been paid for. The Bible doesn't say good
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.760]   people go to heaven, bad people go to hell. It
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.400]   says forgiven people go to heaven. And here's how
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.240]   you know if you have forgiveness, you have
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.680]   trusted Jesus, you alone are the payment for my
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.320]   sin. There's nothing I could do that could earn a
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.280]   relationship with you. It's only by what you did
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.840]   in my place on that cross, bleeding out for me,
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.720]   dying for everything wrong I've ever done or will
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.280]   do that I can have eternal life. And you rose from
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.160]   the dead to prove that payment was enough. And I
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.520]   believe that, that you step into a relationship
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:38.200]   with God that starts from a genuine faith or trust
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.640]   in Jesus. And could it be that you've grown up and
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.080]   you know a lot about him? Man, let's be honest, you
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.200]   live in America. You're going to know a lot about
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.720]   Jesus or a lot more than you're going to know
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:55.120]   about Buddha. But you don't actually have a
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.200]   relationship with him. You don't actually know
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.440]   him. When we were in California this past week on
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.040]   that beach vacation, I had to take an Uber to go
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.040]   meet some friends basically for lunch in another
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.680]   area. And I got an Uber and I was driving and
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.360]   talking with the lady and she's just one of those
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.560]   Uber drivers that's like super chatty. And you're
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.280]   like, man, you clearly have, you know, just a lot
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.920]   on your mind. And yeah, let's talk, lady. And so
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.400]   we talked about a lot of different things and
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.360]   faith being one of them and other things. But at
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.320]   one point we were driving through Malibu and she
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.440]   begins to point out and reference all the
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.720]   different celebrities that lived in Malibu. And
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.360]   she's going like, oh, yeah, you know, there's J
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.560]   Lo, her and Ben. They live right up in that
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.560]   mountain. Bradley Cooper always rides his
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.480]   motorcycle over here. And he'll be in this area.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.480]   And just Malibu had, you know, Mel Gibson. He
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.880]   loves that bar over there that people are hanging
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.280]   out at. And Lady Gaga is in this gated community
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.560]   up here. At one point she's like, and this house
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.880]   we're about to pass used to be shares, but she
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.400]   sold it to, oh man, it's the guy who married one
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.280]   of the Kardashians. And she had like just hot
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.320]   takes. She was like, I just I'm not a fan of his.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.680]   I can't remember his name. And I was like, man, I
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.120]   wonder who she's talking about. And eventually
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.280]   she's like, he's like a musician. I was like,
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.800]   Kanye? She was like, Kanye. Yeah, Kanye lives
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.040]   right over there. Real piece of work. It's such
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.520]   hot takes. It was like, man, who hurt you? And
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.200]   all that to say, it was such a funny experience
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.240]   because you're driving by and you're like, oh,
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.880]   it's so interesting, you know, hearing of all
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.760]   these people maybe you've seen on movies or you
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.280]   listen to their music and you have some
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.040]   familiarity with and you know about. But if I
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.040]   showed up at Kanye's house or I knock on the door
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:39.200]   of, you know, JLo and Ben and I'm like, hey, guys,
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.800]   I'm here. Ben, just got to say, big fan. Goodwill
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.920]   hunting. I thought it was a classic. OK, you guys
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.640]   want to hang? They would say, what are you doing
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.520]   on my property? If I went over to Kanye's and I
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.680]   said, hey, man, you know, high school dropout. I
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.760]   feel like that was the zenith, honestly, of
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.200]   everything in their career. And I just want to
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.320]   hang and dialogue. He would go, who are you?
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.480]   Because I don't know them. I know about them.
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:17.640]   And a lot of people. Live their whole life. And
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.680]   because of the environment they're in, they know
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:24.560]   about Jesus. But they don't know him. They don't
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.840]   have a relationship with him. They have a fake
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:34.800]   faith. Which is not a true or saving faith. And
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:39.400]   finally. After a flawed fake, we see a freeing
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.960]   faith that just God just goes to work in Ephesus
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:49.520]   and says this. Verse 17. When this became known
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.400]   to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, that
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.360]   God was just at work in mighty ways, they were
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.640]   all seized with fear. And the name of the Lord
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:03.520]   Jesus was held in high honor. Many. Of those who
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:11.840]   believed. Who had faith in Jesus. Now came. And
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:17.120]   openly confessed. What they had done. They have
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.200]   this faith that begins to take place and root in
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.040]   their life and it leads them to an action and
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:26.800]   that action is confession. And a number. Who had
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.960]   practiced sorcery or your translation may say
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:36.320]   dark magic. Brought their scrolls together and
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.720]   they burned them publicly. And when they had
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.960]   calculated the value of the scrolls, the total
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.320]   came to 50,000 drachmas or the equivalent of
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.840]   around 10 million dollars today. In this way, the
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.400]   word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.400]   Here's what they just said. Men and women, they
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.600]   began to come to faith in Jesus. And it began to
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.320]   do something in their life and it led to an
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.640]   action. The action wasn't they became perfection.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.960]   It led to confession. And you have men and women.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.360]   I mean, think about what the text just said. They
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.200]   began to bring forward. I have been involved in
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.360]   some dark things. I have practiced dark magic. I
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.040]   have been a part of things that I am ashamed of.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.680]   And it says they began to confess what they had
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:32.760]   done openly. With other believers and they began
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.200]   to repent and say, I am leaving this behind. I'm
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.040]   leaving and piling together. Think about the
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.200]   equivalent of anything that we would put together
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.880]   and go, hey, this is going to be worth 10 million
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.840]   dollars. Which shows the widespread practice of
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.960]   dark magic. It was taking place then. Today in our
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.840]   day, it would be the equivalent of prostitution.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.720]   I've been involved in things I am not proud of.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.720]   I have been involved in things that have hurt
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.520]   people deeply. And they began to bring it forward
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.720]   and say, I am bringing this out now that I'm in
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:08.920]   Christ. My faith is leading to action. And an
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.280]   expression and that expression is confession, that
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.920]   I am going to bring this out and openly share with
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.200]   other people. And when they did, they experienced
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.160]   a freedom. That's the final thing I just want to
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.240]   talk about. One aspect of true faith is that it's
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.080]   a freeing faith. And the reason it's a freeing
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.120]   faith is because it leads believers, very
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:30.760]   important. To confess. Not for the sake of having
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.400]   shame piled on them, but for the sake of
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.280]   experiencing healing. The Bible says that when you
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.040]   and I begin to open up and say, these are the
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.240]   things that I struggle with today, I've been a
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.520]   part of in life and I want to experience healing
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.120]   from them. The step we take is bringing it out in
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.440]   the open to other believers in our life, which is
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.280]   why we hit on community so much, because if you
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.680]   want to experience God's healing in your life and
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.760]   operate from not a place of woundedness, you've
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.120]   got to open up with other people in your life. My
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.640]   son, from time to time, will play outside, he'll
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.000]   get different splinters in his hands, and he's so
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.400]   terrified that I'll have to come in and take
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.400]   tweezers and I have to get it out. And he's like,
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.040]   no, I'm fine. I'll just live with it forever. It'll
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.920]   be great. And I as his dad know, if I don't get
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.880]   that out, it's going to stay painful and infected.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.240]   The only way it can heal is you've got to get it
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.440]   out. And the same is true in Christian faith,
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.760]   whether that's a current struggle with
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.040]   pornography. Maybe it's the same sex relationship
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.360]   no one knows about. Maybe it's something you did
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.320]   in high school you never told anybody about.
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.680]   Maybe it's just a thought battle that just plagues
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.760]   you around body image, anxiety. What do you do
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.920]   with that? The Bible says that we bring that
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.320]   through confession to other believers. In your
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.160]   life. And we share. And this is really important
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.160]   because here's what you need to know. Maybe
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.640]   you're new to Christianity, maybe just you've
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.480]   gotten back in your faith and it's you're trying
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.960]   to follow Jesus. And sometimes, sadly, inside of
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.000]   the church environment, we communicate things
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.480]   unintentionally like this. Here's Bob. Bob last
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.240]   week was strung out on heroin. He was down, you
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.080]   know, doing everything wrong inside of life in
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.240]   the world. And then he trusted Jesus. And now
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.880]   Bob is wearing a suit. He's pinned up and he's
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:16.920]   never struggled since. And that happens. It's
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.400]   just not the case most of the time. And the
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.160]   danger of a message like that is like, oh, man,
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.800]   if I come to Jesus, then everything overnight
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.360]   is always going to be fixed and I won't struggle
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.080]   like this anymore, which is just not the truth.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.040]   And it tells somebody who is in the room who's
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.880]   going, man, I've come to Jesus and I became a
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.240]   believer. And I thought the message was I'm not
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.760]   going to struggle with these things anymore. All
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.720]   the abuse from my past, that's not going to own
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:41.680]   me anymore. Like I'm going to be free. And the
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:50.160]   truth is. One day you will. In eternity. But in
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.200]   this life. When those thoughts and those moments
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.160]   happen, because just as a believer, Kimberly,
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.520]   every broken person inside of this room, myself
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.840]   very much included, still has things and areas
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.520]   that I look at my life and I'm like, God, when
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.880]   are you going to take ground in this? How many
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.040]   more years and how much more age, how much more
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.960]   life am I to have to do where I still struggle
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.480]   with this? I'm at the beach last week and I'm
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.480]   with my kids and I'm with my wife. And you know
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.680]   what still goes through my mind? Man, there's a
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.000]   girl who walks by in a bikini and I want to
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.880]   look and I know I shouldn't, but I still want to.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.080]   And I hope that somebody else walks by. And what
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.680]   do I do with those moments? What do you do when
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.000]   you love Jesus and you still find yourself
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.160]   struggling with things that plague you? Ready?
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.760]   You confess it and you bring it out into the
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:39.840]   light. And you begin to experience healing.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:44.640]   There's no perfect formula that if you do this
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:49.880]   and X, Y, Z, there is a promise from God, Hey, I
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.840]   began this good work and I will finish it. And
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.080]   there may be a differing degrees to which that
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.560]   takes its place out inside of your life that it
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.160]   does another person that you may struggle for a
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.200]   long amount of time or temptation maybe looks
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.960]   different inside of your life. So what do you do
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:08.560]   in those moments? Ready? You confess it to
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:13.600]   experience healing. And when that happens, you
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:17.480]   experience and step towards freedom. And you do
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.640]   this at a thought level of here's the just lies
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.360]   that I'm believing so much of the anxiety in the
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.800]   room is connected to the fact that you won't open
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.920]   up with anyone. And you feel like, man, I'm all
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.560]   alone. No one else struggles with this. And you
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.160]   bought a lie and an enemy that wants you to stay
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.440]   there. And you're the only one who struggles. And
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.680]   if you told them, you know what they would think
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:38.080]   about you. And it's just a lie. And the church
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.360]   in Ephesus did the astonishing move of saying,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.440]   this is what I have been a part of. I have been a
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.800]   part of dark things I am ashamed of, and I am
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.000]   bringing it into the light and I am burning the
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.360]   bridges. They burned the scrolls accounting to
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.960]   50,000 drachmas or $10 million. They weren't
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.160]   like, hey, let's sell this. We'll give it to the
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.440]   church. I am burning every opportunity and I'm
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.840]   walking away, which is called repenting. That
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.840]   looks like I'm pouring the alcohol out. I'm
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.920]   deleting their phone number. I am getting not a
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.920]   smartphone anymore. I'm putting covenant eyes on
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.920]   my phone. I am making steps because this is not
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.760]   something I want to be part of my story. And the
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.040]   good news in Christ is you can confess freely and
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.560]   open up freely because here's what the truth is.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.360]   That doesn't define you. Jesus does. That's why
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.840]   we have the freedom and the opportunity and
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.120]   ability to confess, because, hey, despite the
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.960]   fact that I've done this and I want to do this
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.000]   and I'm doing this, it doesn't define me because
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.080]   Christ defines me. And any amount of shame and
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.560]   guilt that is not from the Lord conviction comes
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.080]   from the spirit. But that's going to leave me
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:37.520]   that I can share this and I am broken. And that's
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.360]   why I need a savior. Romans chapter eight says
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.440]   that Jesus, he's speaker Paul is talking and he
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.320]   says, man, do you know if you were in Christ,
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:49.160]   there is no accusation, no thing that anybody can
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.320]   bring against you. It has been finished and
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.000]   nothing will define you if you are in Jesus,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.160]   because he does. It says this Romans chapter
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.240]   eight, verse thirty one. I'm about to be done.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.880]   What shall I say in response to these things?
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.560]   If God is for us, who can be against us? He
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.560]   didn't spare his own son. He gave him up for us
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.040]   all. How will he not also graciously give us all
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:11.120]   thing who will bring any charge against God's
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:15.560]   elect? It is God who justifies who then is the
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.520]   one who condemns. No one for those who are in
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:25.520]   Christ. Jesus, who died Christ, Jesus, who died
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.160]   more than that, who was raised to life is at the
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.240]   right hand of God interceding for us, so we
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:33.280]   bring it knowing this doesn't define me. And my
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.800]   faith leads to the expression of confession. And
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.320]   when that happens, I experience healing. It's why
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.520]   Paul would write the very first words of the Book
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.120]   of Ephesians and say, Paul, an apostle writing to
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:52.880]   you. Saints, you're not sorcerers. You're not sex
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:59.200]   addicts. You are not perfect. You are saints in
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:06.000]   Christ. And they came and they shared and they
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.760]   experienced healing. And one of the ways, you
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.960]   know, man, I have a real faith, a freeing faith
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.880]   is I open up and I can share. That doesn't define
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:21.400]   me. And the thing you're afraid of right now, the
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.160]   guilt and shame that you carry and you think
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:27.000]   you're going to carry it till you're dead. It's
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.600]   tragic because you think if others knew. Man,
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.720]   that's how they're going to see you. And the
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:42.000]   truth is, no matter how anyone sees you, that
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.360]   doesn't define you. Because in Christ. He defines
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:53.480]   you. It's interesting, we know, like I said, more
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.400]   about the church in Ephesus than any other church.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:00.960]   We know the beginning, we know the middle. And we
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.160]   know something that happened at the end. Thirty
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.480]   years after the apostle Paul would write to the
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:12.560]   Ephesian church. The apostle John would once
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.880]   again, under the instruction of Jesus, write a
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.680]   letter to the church in Ephesus, Revelation,
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.720]   chapter two, the last book of the Bible. The
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.600]   apostle John is instructed by Jesus, hey,
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.160]   there's seven churches, I want you to write to
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:29.600]   these seven churches. The first one, the church
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:33.000]   of Ephesus. And here's what Jesus says to write.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.280]   To the angel, the church in Ephesus, right?
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:43.920]   I know your deeds, your hard work and your
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:47.920]   perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.240]   wicked people, you have tested those who claim
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.360]   to be apostles but are not, and you have found
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.040]   them false. He just said, hey, I know how hard
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.160]   you work. I know how faithful you are. I know
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:03.200]   that you, when it comes to truth, you don't fall
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.040]   for what other people may fall for. You are sound
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:10.080]   biblically. You know the Bible and you stand on
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.200]   it. You have persevered and endured hardship or
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.840]   persecution for my name and have not grown weary.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.120]   Now we stop there. That's a real positive
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:23.960]   encouragement. Mate, you guys are biblically
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.640]   sound. You know the word. You know it to the
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.080]   point when someone says something that's not
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.400]   accurate, you, and not just that, everybody's
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.320]   getting persecuted, people are falling away and
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:38.640]   you're going, I'm going to stand firm. And then
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:44.120]   it takes a shift. Yet I hold this against you.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:48.120]   You have forsaken the love that you had at first.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:56.120]   Consider how far you have fallen. Repent and do
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:01.360]   the things you did at first. If you do not
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.920]   repent, I will come and I will remove your
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.080]   lampstand from its place. Translation, if you
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.440]   don't do the things that you did at first, you're
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.160]   no longer going to be the people of God because
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.240]   you're not going to be the church. What is he
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.280]   saying? The only record of the things they did
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.800]   at first that's contained in the Bible is what
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.040]   we just read in Acts chapter 18. They came
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.680]   together and they opened up and they shared
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.200]   honestly and they confessed. And Jesus just
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.160]   said, hey man, you guys, you're this church and
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.920]   you know the Bible and you, when everyone else
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.640]   may turn away because it costs them, man, you
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:38.160]   stand firm. But you're not doing and living
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.960]   openly and honestly like you used to. You've
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.880]   drifted from your first love that said, I don't
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.400]   care what anyone thinks, I'm going to open up
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.760]   and be honest because I want to experience
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.800]   freedom and I want to honor God. You guys have
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.760]   begun to play the game and you show up Church
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.560]   of Ephesus and you look pretty and you know the
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.960]   Bible and you know things that are right and
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.520]   you're going to stand firm and you know,
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.440]   culture's going to hell in a handbasket, but not
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:07.480]   us. And it's pretend. You're not being open,
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.080]   you're not being honest. You're just playing
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:13.880]   church. And he says, when that happens, you're
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.920]   not the church because the church is meant to
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.720]   be a place where broken people can gather and
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.680]   come together and say, it's okay to not be okay.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.400]   And I need you to come encourage me and say,
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.920]   but we're not going to stay that way. And we're
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.840]   going to lovingly walk alongside of each other.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.960]   Whatever you're walking through, whatever
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.600]   brokenness that you're afraid of, the best
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.280]   encouragement I would give you tonight, you can
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.960]   experience a step towards freedom. Am I saying
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.680]   you won't be tempted tomorrow? No, I'm saying
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:41.640]   you can step towards freedom. Or you can keep
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:46.120]   playing the game and fall into the same trap
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:51.640]   that who knows how it happened in Ephesus. Again,
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.320]   keep going. I know the Bible and community just
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:59.000]   not open. I'm not honest, but that doesn't have
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.240]   to be your story. And for the rest of your life,
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.000]   you and I have the decision. Am I going to live
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.360]   honestly and openly and experience a faith that
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:15.600]   brings freedom? Let me pray. Father, you know,
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:22.880]   the thousands of stories, the thousands of hurts,
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:30.400]   disappointments, heartaches, frustrations, things
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.120]   that have happened in our lives that have led us
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.840]   to make decisions where we've acted in ways that
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:40.280]   we have regret over or we are currently still
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:43.880]   living inside of. And you know the shame and the
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:51.200]   fear. And I pray that you would win tonight. For
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.320]   anyone who knows, man, I just need to, oh, I need
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.800]   to text someone in my community. I don't have a
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.440]   community. I just need somebody that can help me.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:03.520]   That your spirit would flood the hearts of your
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:07.400]   people right now and lead to an outbreak of
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:12.000]   confession, an outbreak of the expression of our
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.640]   faith that that is. And we'd experience healing.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:20.520]   Father, I pray for anyone who has arrived at the
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:24.000]   reality of man, my faith is not real. It's fake.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.400]   They wouldn't feel condemnation. They would feel
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:29.360]   the loving whisper of their heavenly father saying
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:34.640]   I died for you. My son was crucified for you.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:42.440]   And they would cross over. And. Be introduced
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:50.360]   through Jesus to the new. Them. The new life.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.760]   Father, thank you for the story of Ephesus. Would
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.360]   you protect us from playing the game and
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:02.160]   pretending? And would we be your people? We worship
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.960]   you now in song. Amen.
