1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,720
 - How we doing Porch?

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,040
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,960
 Man, it's so fun to be with you guys tonight.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,800
 My name is Garrett.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,620
 If we've never met before,

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,960
 I've been on staff at the Porch for the last five years.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,760
 Came in through the Watermark Residency Program,

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,760
 did some great years out in Fort Worth.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,960
 So shout out to my Fort Worth family

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,140
 and of course every other group that's invisible

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,180
 to the group here in Dallas.

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,680
 But we know all around the country

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,520
 and even around the world,

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,760
 people are tuning in tonight to be a part of this.

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,600
 And now I'm serving with the Awakened Conference.

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,900
 Anybody got an Awakened Conference ticket out there?

18
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,980
 Man, this is gonna be the farthest reaching,

19
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,560
 we pray, event that we've ever done

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,680
 in the entire history of the Porch.

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,080
 It's gonna be something special.

22
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,080
 Hey, we're taking a break from our series tonight,

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,320
 before they were kings.

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,000
 And we're gonna talk about one very, very specific topic.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,560
 So let me share a little mistake I made recently,

26
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,480
 very small, that will introduce this idea.

27
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,000
 So mistake number one, I went to the grocery store.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,200
 Anybody else get really stressed by the grocery store?

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,040
 Just me?

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,080
 I mean, it gets to me, man.

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,980
 I'm just gonna be real with you.

32
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,640
 I get stressed.

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,320
 I feel like it takes too much time.

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,680
 I got other things I wanna get back to doing.

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,200
 Too many people, too many options.

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,560
 And it just kinda gets to me, man.

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,660
 It's a little quirk.

38
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,880
 So I get back to, but once my record was,

39
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,040
 when I was single, it was four months

40
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,580
 I went without even going to the grocery store.

41
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,640
 I was pretty proud of that.

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,200
 I just, I ate out with friends, fasted,

43
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,440
 and I just don't love it.

44
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,700
 So anyway, but my wife now, she works full time.

45
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,440
 We gotta split the domestic responsibilities.

46
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,040
 So I gotta pull some weight around here

47
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,880
 and go to the grocery store.

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,320
 So I'm there, and yogurt is on the list.

49
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,060
 And I've already got my stuff in the cart and everything.

50
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,400
 And I go back to the yogurt,

51
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,320
 and I'm like, the options thing.

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,260
 It is a yogurt avalanche back there.

53
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,680
 It is a bonanza.

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,520
 I don't have another word.

55
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,280
 But it was so much.

56
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,580
 I'm just, I looked at the shelf,

57
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,840
 I was like, I just lost the will to live.

58
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,760
 I'm like, just give me a yogurt.

59
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,740
 So I grabbed one that said nonfat plain.

60
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,120
 See?

61
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,200
 I don't know why you didn't tell me.

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,960
 You guys should come shop with me.

63
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,560
 So I grabbed that, and I was thinking,

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,960
 you know what, I recognize the name on the outside.

65
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,840
 I'm gonna put some fruit and granola around this.

66
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,780
 You know, it's gonna be all right.

67
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,040
 Let me tell you this.

68
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,920
 It was not all right.

69
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,260
 It wasn't even the neighborhood of all right.

70
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,200
 You know what it was?

71
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,600
 It was not even yogurt anymore.

72
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,440
 All right?

73
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,700
 Here's where I learned a very important lesson.

74
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,980
 If you lose the flavor and you lose the fat,

75
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,140
 you've lost the yogurt.

76
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,700
 You now have sour cream, all right?

77
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,540
 That's what you have.

78
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,200
 It's so nasty.

79
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,340
 And so I realized, we changed so much

80
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,100
 of what's essential about this,

81
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,500
 that now it seems like we've even changed the whole thing,

82
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,060
 which is a pretty transferable idea.

83
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,900
 I mean, think about this.

84
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,720
 Isn't this true?

85
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,720
 If you lose enough parts, you eventually lose the whole.

86
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,420
 Eventually, if you lose enough of the essential parts

87
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,780
 of one thing, anything, you eventually will lose the whole,

88
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,860
 the entire thing.

89
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,200
 This can happen with a job.

90
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,460
 Some of you, you had a job and you loved it.

91
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,620
 And then what happened was you got a new boss,

92
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,540
 and then the new boss had new ideas.

93
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,980
 And then all the people you love

94
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,620
 started to go work somewhere else.

95
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,660
 And you look up and you realize one little change at a time,

96
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,080
 and you go, hey, I think I lost the job I love,

97
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
 not because I got fired or went somewhere else,

98
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,600
 but because they changed it one little step at a time.

99
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,480
 And now I can't even recognize my own job anymore.

100
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,720
 It's completely changed.

101
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,640
 It's completely gone.

102
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,340
 This can happen in a relationship.

103
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,680
 You can be dating someone, and then all of a sudden,

104
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,340
 you start losing the quality time of the relationship,

105
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,400
 which is an important part.

106
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,520
 And then it goes another step,

107
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,640
 and you lose the kindness and the good tone,

108
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,520
 you know what I mean?

109
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,060
 The mutual respect of the relationship.

110
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,380
 And then you might go another step,

111
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,500
 and all of a sudden, maybe you look up

112
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,460
 and you even lost the faithfulness of the relationship,

113
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,980
 and you look up and go, who are we kidding?

114
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,940
 It doesn't even feel like we have a relationship at all.

115
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,060
 Because eventually, if you take out

116
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,140
 enough of the essential parts of anything,

117
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,140
 you change the entire thing.

118
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,260
 You can't just endlessly reduce something

119
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,460
 and still have something.

120
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,320
 Some of you may have experienced this at a very young age

121
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,860
 where your family, your mom and dad,

122
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,700
 who were married at the time, sat you down

123
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,140
 and explained to you why mom and dad

124
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,360
 were no longer gonna live in the same place,

125
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,060
 but you were still going to be a family.

126
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,060
 And even at six or eight or 10 years old,

127
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,780
 you wouldn't have known to put it into these words,

128
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,740
 but the truth is, you knew, you knew.

129
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,340
 Like, look, if you live there and you live,

130
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,940
 I mean, are we really a family?

131
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,320
 It feels like it's changed so much

132
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,860
 that if you, at some point, lose enough of the parts,

133
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,100
 we really have changed the whole thing.

134
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,720
 And what I wanna declare and talk about

135
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,580
 a little bit tonight is the fact

136
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,760
 that this can even happen to the church.

137
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,220
 Church can be changed one little part at a time,

138
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,420
 one biblical part removed at a time,

139
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,160
 until all of a sudden the drift is so far

140
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,460
 that you don't even have anything resembling

141
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,460
 a biblical church anymore.

142
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,700
 So what I'd love to do tonight

143
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,900
 is I would love to share three things

144
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,500
 that you can't lose and still be the church,

145
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,060
 three things that you cannot lose.

146
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,020
 If you lose them, you're no longer the church,

147
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,180
 you're something else or really close to it.

148
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,380
 Three essential ingredients, all right,

149
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,560
 that if you lose these parts,

150
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,680
 you really are flirting with corrupting the whole thing.

151
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,620
 Now, I picked a risky topic tonight, and here's why.

152
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,820
 Most of you are not walking around,

153
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,180
 driving around, living around, thinking,

154
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,620
 you know what I need to hear about tonight?

155
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,260
 I need to hear about some church essentials,

156
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,300
 you know, somebody give 'em to me.

157
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,620
 That's not what we typically think about.

158
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,840
 We typically are reacting to our needs in life, you know?

159
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,300
 We typically think, you know what, I gotta get a job.

160
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,340
 You know what, I gotta get a better job.

161
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,660
 You know what, I gotta convince someone

162
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,220
 to spend the rest of their life with me.

163
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,060
 What am I doing?

164
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,340
 You know, like we typically don't walk around

165
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,440
 consumed with, you know what, I need to know,

166
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,340
 what would a biblical church be, you know?

167
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,100
 And it's just not the terms we think in.

168
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,840
 And we know that statistically at least,

169
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,180
 about half of you is our best guess,

170
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,340
 are already committed to a local church.

171
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,180
 You're part of a church.

172
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,020
 You know what a biblical church is,

173
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,900
 either here or somewhere else.

174
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,580
 And it's my hope tonight that the things that we discuss

175
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,580
 would just encourage you to keep chasing

176
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,620
 what you're already chasing.

177
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,620
 But I also know that for the other half of you,

178
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,180
 I have no idea, I am shooting into the dark tonight.

179
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,080
 I have no idea what your relationship with church is.

180
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,840
 Some of you might say, none, I'm just busy,

181
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,940
 so I just kinda drop in every once in a while, podcast.

182
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,420
 It's a casual relationship, you know what I mean?

183
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,140
 Some of you would say it's more complicated.

184
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,460
 It's complicated, that's my relationship with church.

185
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,540
 It's complicated.

186
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,060
 Maybe someone even, maybe you have church pain, you know?

187
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,820
 Maybe from your background at some point,

188
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,800
 it was hard for you to even come in here tonight.

189
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,620
 Maybe the last time you were in a room like this

190
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,580
 and heard someone sing and you heard someone talk,

191
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,060
 maybe someone who I remind you of for whatever reason,

192
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,020
 like put on a microphone and said something hurtful.

193
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,940
 Maybe when you look at church, you think, you know what,

194
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,140
 I don't really have a problem with what's going on there.

195
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,140
 I just don't know if I can believe it.

196
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,020
 You know, intellectual credibility, man.

197
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,540
 Like I don't really know if I can believe everything.

198
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,300
 So I have no idea for the half of you,

199
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,260
 some of you are like, man,

200
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,380
 somebody invited me to the porch.

201
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,540
 I thought he was inviting me to his house.

202
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,600
 I'm like, where am I right now?

203
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,660
 Some of you, you know, totally caught off guard.

204
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,580
 But whatever your relationship is with church tonight,

205
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,100
 the reason I wanna put these in front of you

206
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,580
 is because of the way God changed my life

207
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,900
 through the church.

208
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,540
 See, my relationship with church was when I grew up,

209
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,440
 I went to church some.

210
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,820
 I was there Christmas and Easter.

211
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,540
 We were in a very small town in Texas,

212
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,660
 very conservative culture.

213
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,320
 My mom had a little tattoo on her ankle.

214
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,040
 She would put a bandaid over that tattoo on the ankle

215
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,940
 because, you know, small town church,

216
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,180
 it gets a little tight in there.

217
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,820
 So she'd been divorced several times, you know,

218
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,520
 she'd had three kids, but three dads,

219
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,900
 and I was the middle kid.

220
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,100
 And so we were just a little bit

221
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,140
 on the outskirts of the village, you know?

222
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,400
 And we went to church some,

223
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,860
 and I came to the conclusion by the time

224
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,340
 I was about 14 or 15,

225
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,460
 that church was the main source of boredom in the world.

226
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,560
 All right, I mean, that's where I was.

227
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,400
 That's where I lived.

228
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,680
 There were more interesting things to do, you know?

229
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,800
 And all of a sudden, I just ran down as far as I could

230
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,800
 a path of promiscuity, partying, pornography addiction,

231
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,400
 and addiction to self.

232
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,480
 Narcissism is the only way I can say it.

233
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,500
 I just completely pursued anything I wanted to do.

234
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,800
 I was a hedonist, you know?

235
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,440
 It just means I sought pleasure.

236
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,800
 Whatever was fun, that's what I did.

237
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,080
 And all of a sudden, I looked up at 18, 19 years old,

238
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,260
 and I realized this is not fun anymore.

239
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,220
 My life is broken.

240
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,380
 I'm sick and tired of the hangovers.

241
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,900
 I'm tired of drama-filled relationships.

242
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,620
 You ever been in a drama-filled relationship?

243
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,500
 Oh my goodness.

244
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,580
 So I'm tired.

245
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,100
 I'm tired of pregnancy scares.

246
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,060
 I'm tired of guilt.

247
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,020
 I'm tired of shame.

248
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,980
 And all of a sudden,

249
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,000
 I had been at the world's carnival away from church,

250
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,840
 and then all of a sudden,

251
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,380
 the rides started to make me sick.

252
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,540
 And I was tired.

253
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,780
 And I found out that there wasn't life there anymore.

254
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,780
 And what happened to me was God showed me

255
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,600
 that the one I had heard about my whole life,

256
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,040
 the one who got on a cross for me,

257
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,520
 the one who had come out of a tomb for me,

258
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,600
 that's Jesus, paid for everything,

259
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,480
 knowing in advance that I was going to do that,

260
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,960
 that I was gonna run that far.

261
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,120
 And then when he enlightened my eyes to see that,

262
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,200
 he didn't just give me a heaven to be saved to,

263
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,080
 he gave me a people to belong to.

264
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,440
 And so what I'd love to share with you tonight

265
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,340
 is if you're on that end where you say,

266
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,980
 I don't really want a formal relationship with church,

267
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,460
 that's not really my favorite thing,

268
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,300
 I would just say,

269
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,060
 I hope that something that is shared tonight

270
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,820
 would be as attractive to you as the church became to me

271
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,620
 when my life started finally to change.

272
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,420
 So three things tonight that you can't lose

273
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,260
 if you're still gonna be the church.

274
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,980
 I picked these three, okay?

275
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,580
 So there's the greatest weakness of this message.

276
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,660
 And some of you are like,

277
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,500
 going through the Bible,

278
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
 looking for this list of three,

279
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,340
 you won't find it.

280
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,980
 It's not like Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus.

281
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,420
 Three things you must be in order to still be the church.

282
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,660
 It doesn't work that way.

283
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,020
 But I picked these three for a specific reason.

284
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,340
 It's because I think these are the three

285
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,140
 that are most popularly abandoned in our day to day.

286
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,540
 The three things that I think are most popularly abandoned

287
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,520
 that will make us cease to be the church.

288
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,720
 Here they are, I'm gonna give them to you in order,

289
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,560
 and then we'll go.

290
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,420
 Number one, authentic connection with other Christians.

291
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,180
 Number two, willingness to be counter-cultural.

292
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,480
 And number three, the urgency in the mission of Jesus.

293
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,780
 We'll take those slower as we go.

294
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,860
 First, authentic connection with other Christians.

295
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,220
 What does that mean?

296
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,260
 It means they know you and you know them.

297
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,980
 Not just you are near them and they are near you.

298
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,340
 That is so different.

299
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,380
 Did you know that you can be in close proximity,

300
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,660
 of course, some of you are in a city and you're lonely.

301
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,280
 How could you be lonely in a city?

302
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,120
 The math doesn't work.

303
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
 There's more people in the city.

304
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,660
 You should be more connected than ever.

305
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,140
 But somehow it's possible to be lonely in a city

306
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,980
 because you can be close to a person,

307
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,980
 but not close to a person.

308
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,860
 And they don't know you.

309
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,780
 They don't know what your fears are.

310
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,700
 They don't know what your doubts are.

311
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,220
 They don't know what your insecurities are.

312
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,580
 They don't know what your tendencies are.

313
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,580
 They don't know where you're prone to leave the God

314
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,780
 that you love or hope to love.

315
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,840
 They don't know your weaknesses.

316
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,680
 They don't know your strengths.

317
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,760
 All of a sudden, there's a surface level social game

318
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,560
 that's going on as we all just kind of remain

319
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,020
 on the surface of life.

320
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,260
 And what happens in a real church,

321
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,300
 in a place where the scripture is being pursued,

322
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,920
 is that you have an authentic connection

323
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,760
 with other Christians.

324
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,580
 This happened to me, man.

325
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,060
 I remember the first time this happened.

326
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,780
 I had been living the life I just described.

327
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,180
 All of a sudden, a dude invites me to a small group.

328
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,300
 I was like, I don't know what this,

329
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,300
 well, I don't know what this group that is small is,

330
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,260
 but I will show up, whatever.

331
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,480
 So I showed up, and all of a sudden,

332
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,140
 this dude opens up with the line,

333
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,580
 hey, these are, okay, let me set the stage

334
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,660
 a little more clearly.

335
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,920
 This is eight college dudes, nobody else, all right?

336
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,460
 Eight college dudes.

337
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,740
 And this dude breaks off with,

338
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,560
 "Hey guys, I just wanna confess masturbation to you guys.

339
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,580
 "And yeah, that was a part of my week.

340
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,480
 "All right, let me be more real.

341
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,020
 "It actually happened twice."

342
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,380
 And that's what he started in on.

343
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,220
 And I had no idea what he was doing.

344
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,860
 I was like, you're not even gonna warm up to it, man.

345
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,780
 You're not even gonna get to,

346
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,060
 we're not gonna get to know each other.

347
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,660
 (congregation laughing)

348
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,500
 It was weird.

349
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,340
 And all of a sudden, they started to go around the circle.

350
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,740
 And I realized, what they're trying to do

351
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,740
 is they're trying to follow Jesus together.

352
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,940
 That's all they're trying to do.

353
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,880
 What they're trying to do is they're trying

354
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,960
 to be honest with each other.

355
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,480
 They're trying to authentically confess to one another.

356
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,400
 They're trying to be known by one another.

357
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,880
 That's the goal here.

358
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,880
 You know how sometimes you can tell

359
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,080
 some people don't wanna be known?

360
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,760
 That's why the average length of conversation is very short.

361
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,280
 Because at some point, a few seconds in,

362
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,400
 you gotta make a decision about whether you're gonna be

363
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,960
 in or out on the conversation.

364
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,280
 And all of a sudden, I realized,

365
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,120
 for the first time in my life,

366
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,540
 I am around people committed to depth in church.

367
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,940
 This amazed me.

368
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,120
 I had never seen that before.

369
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,320
 I thought church was full of hypocrites, you know,

370
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,280
 and full of people pretending to be perfect.

371
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,400
 And those dudes, for sure,

372
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,360
 were not pretending to be perfect.

373
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,180
 I can tell you that.

374
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,360
 They made that abundantly clear right at the start.

375
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,640
 And they were just being honest.

376
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,560
 I had been around nothing but college baseball locker rooms,

377
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,920
 and I only had friends who were exactly like me.

378
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,320
 And I just, it was a mundane world

379
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,600
 of surface-level conversation.

380
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,240
 And the drunk, "I love you, man,"

381
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,240
 had nothing on the depth that I saw amongst these people.

382
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,260
 And I wanted it.

383
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,900
 It's normal.

384
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,620
 It's normal, biblically,

385
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,740
 that if you're gonna be the church,

386
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,220
 you're gonna have to get below the surface.

387
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,220
 You're gonna have to be honest.

388
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,520
 You're gonna have to let yourself be known

389
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,620
 for where you're strong and also where you're weak.

390
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,500
 Here it is from the scripture, Hebrews 3:13.

391
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,700
 "Exhort one another,"

392
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,860
 this is a fascinating verse, by the way.

393
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,680
 I love this verse.

394
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,780
 "Exhort one another every day, as long as it's called today,

395
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,200
 so that none of you may be hardened

396
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,680
 by the deceitfulness of sin."

397
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,520
 All right, let's look at this.

398
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,120
 There's a problem and a solution.

399
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,880
 The problem is,

400
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,400
 none of you would be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

401
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,720
 That's the problem, deceitfulness of sin,

402
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,560
 deceitfulness of sin.

403
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,200
 What is the deceitfulness of sin?

404
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,520
 It's that you would do wrong and not care.

405
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,440
 It's that you would do wrong from yourself,

406
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,640
 you know, not because of some circumstance forced you,

407
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,240
 but like out of you, like there's a brokenness in you,

408
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,520
 a prone to wander in you.

409
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,100
 And you would actually do wrong from yourself,

410
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,420
 maybe for yourself, and you would think to yourself,

411
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,700
 "That doesn't really affect myself."

412
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,580
 That's the deceitfulness of sin,

413
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,140
 that you just do whatever you want

414
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,700
 and be completely ignorant of the fact

415
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,200
 that you are hardening your own heart against God

416
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,140
 and maybe ruining your life.

417
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,300
 That's what the problem is.

418
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,540
 That's a very individual problem, you know what I mean?

419
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,680
 Individual problem.

420
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,260
 But look at the solution he gave right at the start.

421
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,500
 "But exhort," what?

422
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,340
 "One another."

423
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,640
 He just gave a group solution to our individual problem.

424
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,320
 There's no person you've ever met

425
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,440
 who doesn't have that individual problem,

426
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,040
 the tendency to sin, the tendency to the wrong.

427
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,760
 Doesn't mean they're as bad as they could be,

428
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,680
 it just means they're not as good as they should be.

429
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,720
 Does that make sense?

430
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,440
 And the truth is, is that we need one another.

431
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,680
 Christianity is a team sport, it always has been.

432
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,200
 Man, people get really creative

433
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,120
 in the ways they talk themselves out of this.

434
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,580
 I just wanna tell you that.

435
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,060
 People get so creative when they don't wanna be known

436
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,460
 or they don't wanna be a part of a church.

437
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,740
 I was sharing the gospel with a guy a couple months ago,

438
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,740
 his name was Jeff.

439
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,780
 He was a really nice guy, he seemed super open.

440
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,220
 So I went to the conversation and I said,

441
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,000
 "Hey Jeff, let me take a turn in the conversation, man.

442
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,420
 "Do you have a faith?"

443
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,080
 And he said, "Yeah man, I'm a Christian."

444
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,580
 He was ready, boy, he was ready.

445
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,420
 I said, "That's great, man.

446
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,620
 "Well, let me ask you this, Jeff.

447
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,760
 "If that dude over there came up to you and said,

448
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,200
 "Jeff, I heard you're a Christian.

449
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,480
 "I wanna go to heaven, man, what I gotta do?

450
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,340
 "What would you say?"

451
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,940
 And he said, "I would tell him by grace through faith,

452
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,920
 "alone in the cross of Jesus Christ, alone."

453
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,940
 I mean, he was ready.

454
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,920
 I was like, "Dude, this brother needs to preach."

455
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,060
 But I didn't tell him that.

456
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,820
 Instead, I said, "Okay, Jeff, one more question.

457
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,420
 "Go one more with me.

458
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,020
 "What church are you a part of?"

459
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,700
 He got real passionate.

460
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,020
 He was like, "Oh, you know what?

461
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,120
 "I don't even need a church.

462
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,960
 "You know what?

463
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,240
 "I mean, man, I don't have to go to church

464
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,140
 "to be a Christian."

465
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,420
 And he started, I mean, he gave me like eight objections.

466
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,420
 It was almost like he was more ready for me to ask that.

467
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,620
 And his big like landing point, this was fun.

468
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,440
 He said, "You know, Jesus said,

469
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,420
 "where two or three are gathered, there I am among them."

470
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,360
 I said, "That's great, Jeff.

471
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,420
 "Who are you, two or three?"

472
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,540
 He said, "I got my roommate, but he's an atheist."

473
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,980
 I said, "That's bad math, Jeff."

474
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,980
 All right, that's not gonna work, all right?

475
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,600
 We get so creative when we wanna talk ourselves out of it.

476
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,380
 Let's just do a little call and response right quick.

477
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,220
 All right, let me tell you.

478
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,600
 Here's some objections I've heard.

479
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,060
 These are direct from people, all right?

480
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,300
 This is a real thing.

481
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,320
 I'm not making fun of anybody up here.

482
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,540
 Much, but I wanna just tell you,

483
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,380
 these are the responses that you get, okay?

484
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,220
 I've heard people say,

485
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,580
 "I don't need to go to church to be a Christian."

486
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,420
 You heard that?

487
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,580
 "I don't need to go to church to be a Christian."

488
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,700
 Right, kind of like I don't need to go home to be married.

489
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,140
 Okay, the answer is that's probably not gonna work long.

490
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,980
 You know what I'm saying?

491
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,900
 Like it's just not gonna go very far for very long.

492
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,060
 It doesn't, here's one.

493
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,700
 People at church are as messed up as me.

494
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,700
 Great, you'll fit right in.

495
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,540
 It's gonna be amazing.

496
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,360
 You can meet all your friends.

497
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,100
 (congregation laughing)

498
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,180
 I love this.

499
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,360
 I don't need an organization.

500
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,860
 I can change the world on my own.

501
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,260
 Awesome, how's that going for you?

502
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,100
 Where'd you change the world?

503
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,280
 What'd you do?

504
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,660
 You can't do it alone.

505
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,500
 That's the truth.

506
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,000
 Some dudes get super spiritual with it.

507
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,840
 I love this.

508
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,320
 Have you ever heard somebody use the term Big C Church?

509
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,560
 You ever heard that term?

510
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,900
 Big C Church, here's what it means.

511
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,180
 It means the global church,

512
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,880
 all believers in all places, all over the earth,

513
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,020
 every nation, you know?

514
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,040
 And so some dudes will go theological with this

515
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,380
 and they'll say,

516
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,580
 "You know what?

517
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,820
 "I'm a Big C Church guy.

518
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,960
 "I love the whole church, you know, global.

519
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,780
 "So I don't really wanna commit to any specific one."

520
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,460
 Okay.

521
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,860
 Ladies, if you were with a man.

522
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,700
 I feel like I don't even need to finish this right now.

523
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,380
 (congregation laughing)

524
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,220
 I will.

525
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,320
 And he says,

526
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,140
 "You know, I'm kind of a Big W women guy.

527
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,380
 "Global women, all women.

528
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,820
 "So I don't really feel the need to commit myself,

529
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,340
 "you know, with all of my gifts

530
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,980
 "to any little W woman specifically."

531
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,580
 Leave, all right?

532
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,940
 You're like, that is the most unhealthy.

533
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,780
 You'd be like,

534
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,500
 "You got some psychological issues is what you have."

535
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,340
 All right?

536
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,260
 That's the fact of the matter.

537
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,460
 And so it just doesn't make sense.

538
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,300
 Let me just be honest with you.

539
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,560
 It just doesn't make sense to be like,

540
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,660
 "I'm so into the global movement of Jesus

541
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,140
 "that I can't commit to the local movement of Jesus."

542
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,380
 You can't add, okay?

543
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,700
 Like that doesn't work, all right?

544
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,200
 You have to be able to do this.

545
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,080
 Christianity is a team sport.

546
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,000
 It always has been.

547
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,740
 And the team is the local church.

548
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,500
 Why do we talk ourselves out of being on the team

549
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,140
 that we claim to be on?

550
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,980
 It doesn't even make sense.

551
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,180
 It's normal to have, if you're a believer in Christ,

552
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,540
 to be the church, you must be a part of a church.

553
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,460
 An imperfect place, you'll fit right in,

554
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,700
 show up, be a part of it, and get engaged, all right?

555
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,560
 Number two, a willingness to be counter-cultural.

556
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,940
 Changing gears completely.

557
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,420
 A willingness to be counter-cultural.

558
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,980
 This is essential if we want to be the church.

559
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,180
 Or if you change your mind about wanting one,

560
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,740
 this is something you should look for.

561
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,740
 A willingness to be counter-cultural.

562
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,740
 Now, what do I mean by this?

563
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,900
 Counter means against.

564
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,740
 That's all it means.

565
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,260
 So you have to be willing to go against

566
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,620
 popular culture sometimes.

567
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,180
 Kind of works like this.

568
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,020
 Summer's coming up.

569
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,740
 We got any lazy river people in here?

570
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,780
 Lazy river people, looking forward to it?

571
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,300
 Man, you guys are hard workers.

572
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
 I'm looking forward to the lazy river myself.

573
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,940
 The lazy river is a place where you go without any effort.

574
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,660
 It's a place where you and everybody else,

575
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,020
 there is no freedom of thought.

576
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,980
 There is no, it is we are going, all right?

577
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,620
 And there's not a lot of force involved.

578
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,660
 It's just, you know, hands off.

579
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,420
 Popular culture is like that.

580
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,940
 You don't have to do any effort.

581
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,380
 You can just go.

582
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,500
 Path of least resistance.

583
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,500
 And then, you may remember at some point when you were a kid

584
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,860
 you get out of the lazy river and you decide

585
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,700
 you're gonna run uphill just to see how hard it is.

586
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,420
 And you realize it's really hard

587
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,100
 and it kind of upsets the people, all right?

588
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,500
 And so it is frustrating to those as you walk upstream

589
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
 and it takes a lot of effort and you realize

590
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,940
 how much force is actually in your face.

591
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,660
 At some point, being a Christian will feel like that.

592
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:36,020
 At some point, you will feel a sense of disagreement

593
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,420
 with the culture around you.

594
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,340
 Not because you wanna be disagreeable.

595
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,940
 Not because you wanna be a know-it-all.

596
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,580
 Not because you wanna be argumentative.

597
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,380
 And by the way, let me put that boundary in place.

598
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,380
 I didn't say an eagerness to be counter-cultural.

599
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,220
 That's not Christian.

600
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,260
 You don't wanna be argumentative.

601
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,540
 You don't wanna be combative.

602
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,460
 That's not the point.

603
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,900
 You don't wanna just turn around in the lazy river

604
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,820
 and splash for no reason.

605
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,660
 That just doesn't make any sense.

606
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,080
 It's gonna upset the people, all right?

607
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,340
 But what you have to do is be willing

608
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,540
 to humbly and gently walk with Jesus

609
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,940
 even when the rest of the world is in conflict

610
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,340
 with your choice or with your belief.

611
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,300
 That's just a normal part of Christianity.

612
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,740
 In fact, at one point in the scripture,

613
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,620
 the Bible calls you in exile.

614
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,460
 Did you know that?

615
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,500
 If you happen to be a believer in Christ,

616
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,580
 exile means you have been exiled, okay?

617
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,680
 Like you are not a part of the rest of the people.

618
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,380
 You are different.

619
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,780
 And that's a normal part of being a Christian.

620
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,940
 Jesus did counter-cultural things all the time.

621
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,900
 And I just wanna be more clear

622
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,140
 about what I mean by counter-cultural.

623
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,740
 I know some people, like going against the grain

624
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,700
 means something like, you mean like you have a wedding

625
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,140
 and don't have a hashtag, you know?

626
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,980
 Like, no.

627
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,820
 I mean like in some more meaningful way.

628
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,220
 Like, you run a marathon and don't tell anybody?

629
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,160
 That would be crazy.

630
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,000
 That would be crazy.

631
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,820
 Somebody should definitely do that.

632
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,100
 I've never heard of that at all.

633
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,460
 (congregation laughing)

634
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,740
 But I mean in some meaningful ways

635
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,060
 that you would be willing to go against culture.

636
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,020
 Jesus did this all the time.

637
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,660
 Think about some things Jesus said.

638
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,480
 Let me summarize.

639
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,000
 He told rich people it would be hard for them.

640
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,680
 Everybody knows it's easy for rich people, right?

641
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,540
 He told rich people it'd be hard for them to go to heaven.

642
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,300
 He showed women they were important

643
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,100
 at a time when not many believed that.

644
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,220
 He told men they couldn't divorce their wives for no reason

645
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,820
 at a time when not many believed that.

646
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,900
 He told leaders to act like slaves of their people.

647
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,820
 Nobody did that.

648
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,220
 He told people to pay their taxes

649
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,620
 even though the government was corrupt.

650
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,300
 He invited white-collar criminals to become his followers.

651
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,260
 This is my favorite one.

652
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,780
 He told religious leaders that they were the devil's kids.

653
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:34,060
 Literally, quote, "You are of your father, the devil,"

654
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,980
 end quote.

655
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,920
 It's right there in John chapter eight.

656
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,340
 Jesus, if you're watching this,

657
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,620
 at some point you lean over to your friend

658
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,460
 and you just say, "I don't think he cares what we think.

659
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,020
 "I think he is totally free from what we think."

660
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,320
 And in fact, that actually happened.

661
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,780
 In Mark chapter 12, it says,

662
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,900
 "And they came and said to him,

663
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,860
 "Teacher, we know that you are true

664
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,580
 "and do not care about anyone's opinion,

665
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,320
 "for you are not swayed by appearances,

666
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,860
 "but you truly teach the way of God."

667
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,420
 And I just wonder, could anyone say that about you, truly?

668
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,620
 Could anyone accurately say to you,

669
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,140
 if you claim to be a part, if you don't,

670
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,940
 this question wouldn't even make sense,

671
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,700
 but if you claim to be a follower of Jesus,

672
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,380
 could people say that your way of life

673
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,880
 is fully independent from the approval of people?

674
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,660
 Could people say that you're an independent thinker?

675
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,380
 Could people say that you're firm enough

676
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,140
 to go wherever Jesus goes?

677
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,780
 Could they say that accurately of your life?

678
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,020
 You will feel the resistance at times.

679
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,740
 Some of you feel it when you decide to stop sleeping

680
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,100
 with the person you're dating out of honor for Jesus,

681
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,340
 and they look at you like you are from another world.

682
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,700
 Or all of a sudden, you're the person in the office.

683
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,460
 You come into a relationship with Christ,

684
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,940
 and all of a sudden, you're the person in the office

685
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,900
 who wants to honor the boss who no one likes,

686
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,460
 and everyone is mystified,

687
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,740
 because you honor the boss who is not honorable,

688
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,380
 and they look at you like you're from

689
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,300
 a complete other world.

690
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,980
 Or when you stop partying, and you go,

691
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,040
 "Look, if I have to find new friends, I find new friends,

692
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,580
 "but I can't go back to that same place."

693
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,780
 And all of a sudden, people look at you

694
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,620
 like you're from another world.

695
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,380
 They're doing that because now you are,

696
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,060
 and you're gonna notice that sometimes

697
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,380
 if you choose to follow Jesus.

698
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,380
 It's normal to have to be willing at times

699
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,260
 to go against the grain of culture.

700
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,300
 Number three, urgency in the mission of Jesus.

701
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,760
 If you wanna be the church,

702
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,180
 or if you wanna find one at any point,

703
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,700
 you're gonna need to find people,

704
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,420
 or be a person who is urgent in your personal mission.

705
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,780
 If you wanna see the mission God gave

706
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,260
 every single one of us, it's in Matthew 28, 19 to 20.

707
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,080
 It goes like this.

708
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,260
 This is the words of Jesus.

709
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,960
 Go, very famous words.

710
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,780
 Go, therefore, you're like, "Go where?"

711
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,920
 It says to all nations.

712
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,980
 Well, that includes this one.

713
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,620
 So like, go to work and make disciples.

714
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,060
 Go to your friend and make disciples.

715
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,460
 Go to your family and make disciples.

716
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,860
 Some of you like to get a little creative,

717
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,620
 and you're like, "Can I go to the bar and make disciples?"

718
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,940
 No, it's not gonna help you, all right?

719
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,980
 Go to the people you can go to

720
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,900
 and lead them in such a way that they fall in love

721
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,560
 with the way of Christ because they read your life.

722
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,180
 What it means to make, you're like, "Make disciples."

723
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,020
 What does that mean?

724
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,840
 Here's what it means.

725
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,940
 It means to be so in love with Jesus

726
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:23,940
 that you can't help but love your friends so much

727
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,360
 that you try to connect them to him.

728
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,520
 That's all make disciples is.

729
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,340
 It's to love Jesus so much that you can't help

730
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,620
 but wanna take your people, your friends,

731
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,860
 your relationships, the people God has put in front of you

732
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,380
 and to actually lead them toward the one

733
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,680
 who is total fulfillment and total satisfaction

734
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,300
 and total joy.

735
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,780
 That's what it means to make disciples.

736
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,100
 It means, you can call it evangelism, share the gospel.

737
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,140
 You can call it outreach, serve the poor.

738
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,580
 You can call it anything you want.

739
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,420
 It is loving people so much that you must bring them

740
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,440
 to the one who is love.

741
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,960
 And I just wanna say, the first time this starts

742
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,040
 to happen to you, it is a little nerve-wracking.

743
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,840
 Let me tell you, this is the first time in my life,

744
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,600
 a specific moment when I actually wanted

745
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,800
 to try to make a disciple.

746
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,620
 I wouldn't have called it that.

747
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,280
 I just would have said I wanted to help my friend.

748
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,120
 But here's what happened.

749
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,320
 We were in college and we were both working retail.

750
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,920
 I did not go to college in order to work at Men's Warehouse,

751
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,360
 but I ended up there because that's where I could get a job.

752
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,160
 So there I was.

753
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,960
 And me and my friend, we were working,

754
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,880
 and I had left the party scene about six months prior.

755
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,700
 So I mean, I was like fresh out of the world,

756
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,480
 just trying to follow Jesus for the very first time.

757
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,860
 And this dude was completely still entrenched in everything.

758
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,760
 And his joy was very fragile, just like mine had been.

759
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,840
 I knew right where he was.

760
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,280
 He would come to work, he was moody, he was tired,

761
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,000
 he was frustrated.

762
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,040
 It was the highest of highs and lowest of lows,

763
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,160
 usually the lows.

764
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,760
 And he was just kind of wearing himself out.

765
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,280
 He always seemed to be on the verge

766
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,800
 of really wrecking his life.

767
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,920
 And I knew what that was 'cause I had been there,

768
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,240
 and my heart just broke for him.

769
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,800
 And one day he was in a low, low valley,

770
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,720
 and we were closing up shop.

771
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,760
 And we were standing up front at the registers.

772
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,280
 And I could just see he was tired, he was hungover.

773
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,800
 I could tell he had a headache, dehydrated, disoriented,

774
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
 you know what I mean, just the whole deal, man.

775
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,520
 And I saw him, and it was just so fresh in my memory

776
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,240
 what that had felt like.

777
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,960
 And so I just realized my heart starts racing.

778
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,160
 I'm like, I think God's telling me to talk to this dude.

779
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,480
 I was not a pastor.

780
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,840
 I had no reps, I had no nothing.

781
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,280
 I just had, I love this dude, I don't know what to say.

782
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,580
 It's one college dude talking to another.

783
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,420
 That's all I had.

784
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,800
 And so all of a sudden my heart's kind of racing,

785
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
 and I'm like, if I don't talk to this dude,

786
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,840
 God's gonna keep me up all night.

787
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,640
 You know, like I gotta say something.

788
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,960
 I didn't have any words.

789
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,660
 And so what happened was I just said, hey man,

790
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:47,320
 not making this up, hey man,

791
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,840
 I'm afraid that if you keep doing this,

792
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,520
 history's gonna kind of keep repeating itself,

793
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,720
 and I just think there's a better way.

794
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,080
 And he knew I was a Christian, so he, you know,

795
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,600
 it wasn't exactly we shared the gospel

796
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,700
 and he got baptized on the spot,

797
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,160
 but it was my first time, okay, you know,

798
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,560
 I didn't have, it was the best I could do.

799
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,880
 But he knew exactly what I was referring to, you know?

800
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,000
 And so I said it and kind of stopped, looked at the ground.

801
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,760
 And after you do that for the first time, you're like,

802
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,960
 is my friendship with this dude over?

803
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,440
 Is he about to, you know, hit me in the face?

804
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,340
 Like, what is about to happen?

805
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,360
 Like, you're so nervous, like, it's not normal, you know?

806
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,320
 You're like, what did I just do?

807
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,960
 Oh my gosh, am I the crazy guy with a sign on the street

808
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,360
 who's saying, you know, you don't know,

809
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,360
 it's like an out of body experience, it's so weird.

810
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,920
 And so all of a sudden I like,

811
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,000
 I waited and I just said that and he goes,

812
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,840
 thanks man, I appreciate that.

813
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,660
 And that was it.

814
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,400
 And I went to my car and I was like, okay, you know,

815
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,960
 it was so bizarre, you know?

816
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,440
 And some of you have, you know,

817
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,340
 you don't know what that feels like

818
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,280
 because you've never reached out to a friend

819
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,600
 to actually try to be a friend.

820
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,740
 Some of you, you share the gospel everywhere you go

821
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,020
 and you remember that first time where you're like,

822
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,900
 oh my gosh, they're gonna think I'm crazy, you know,

823
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,980
 they're never gonna talk to me again.

824
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,420
 And the truth is they might feel your love coming across

825
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,340
 because that's what it really is, right?

826
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,060
 And I just wanna tell you,

827
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,220
 if you haven't felt that before,

828
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,820
 it's so freeing to love someone so much

829
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,180
 that you no longer care what they think of you.

830
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,340
 And if you think you're a friend,

831
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,820
 but you care more about someone's opinion than their soul,

832
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,140
 you are no friend, is the truth.

833
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,740
 And so urgency in the mission of Jesus is part of it, man.

834
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,200
 That's part of the deal.

835
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,040
 If you love him, if you know him,

836
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,520
 and you know he loved you first,

837
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,260
 then it is unavoidable that if you wanna be the church,

838
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,860
 a sense of urgency for the people around you,

839
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,900
 you can't force them.

840
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,940
 Let me just say that, you know, you can't force anybody,

841
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,220
 you don't need to force anybody.

842
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,780
 Don't preach, you know, don't like go home to your roommate

843
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,780
 and be like, I've been waiting, you know?

844
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,260
 Like don't go in and like,

845
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,660
 don't go unload on your roommate.

846
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,700
 Like that's not the point.

847
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,620
 It is something to propose, okay?

848
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,100
 It's not something to impose, okay?

849
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,580
 You offer Jesus to people.

850
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,020
 But if you don't offer,

851
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,940
 you're not extending what Jesus died to extend

852
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,780
 to that person.

853
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,680
 And it's normal, it is normal for us to have a sense

854
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,300
 of urgency in personal mission.

855
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,560
 In fact, this is what's fun.

856
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,000
 Some of you are here tonight because of that.

857
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,980
 Somebody took a risk, didn't they?

858
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,140
 Somebody said, somebody at work decided

859
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,860
 to have a non-work conversation with you

860
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,100
 and put themselves out there and say,

861
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,980
 hey, there's this thing I want you to come to.

862
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,820
 It's church.

863
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,640
 I don't know how you deal where you're at with that,

864
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,480
 but please come.

865
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,420
 And here you are.

866
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,740
 You didn't hit him in the face or anything.

867
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,420
 You were like, all right, man, let's do this.

868
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,040
 Somebody got you here with a risk.

869
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,540
 Some family member, you know, sent you a little email

870
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,180
 or hit you up on, you know, gave you a text.

871
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,140
 And they said, hey, and with no doubt,

872
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,680
 hoping they don't push you away even further,

873
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,660
 decided to take one little risk,

874
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,000
 one further little step to say,

875
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,180
 hey, you should try this place.

876
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,940
 And here you are.

877
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,100
 That's normal Christianity.

878
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,360
 Then instead of just hoarding all our relational credibility

879
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,700
 that we would actually use it to connect people

880
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,980
 to the God who loves them.

881
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,380
 That's normal.

882
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,380
 That's how it works.

883
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,460
 Three things that we gotta keep

884
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,200
 if we're gonna be the church, really be the church.

885
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,020
 Urgency in our personal mission,

886
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,180
 a willingness to be counter-cultural.

887
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,020
 And of course, my first point, which is so terrific,

888
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,300
 I'm having to scroll up to get it.

889
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,580
 Authentic connection with other Christians.

890
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,320
 Let me finish here.

891
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,060
 There's one more piece of the puzzle

892
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,340
 that I just think is so critical,

893
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,180
 that anywhere you find this,

894
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,780
 you have probably found a church,

895
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,140
 and anywhere you don't find this,

896
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,220
 you haven't found a church.

897
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,140
 And that's something that's called the gospel.

898
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,700
 The gospel is not just a type of music.

899
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,540
 That's what I always thought it was.

900
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,380
 Like, what's gospel?

901
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,660
 Is that like a choir?

902
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,100
 The gospel is good news.

903
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,940
 That's what it means.

904
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,180
 That's the word in Greek.

905
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,380
 It literally means good news.

906
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,220
 It's that simple.

907
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,620
 So for the rest of your life, you know what gospel means.

908
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,460
 It means good news.

909
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,320
 And you go, well, what's the good news?

910
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,360
 I could use good news.

911
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,360
 Bad news everywhere.

912
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,880
 It's the good news that even though you've sinned,

913
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,720
 you're loved.

914
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,520
 It's that even though you've done wrong,

915
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,240
 God's good, and he's right.

916
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,020
 It's that even though you've created shame for yourself

917
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,680
 through a series of choices you made,

918
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,000
 God made a series of choices to come and get you back.

919
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,840
 The gospel means that even though we all were like sheep

920
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,560
 and went astray, that's what sheep do.

921
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,640
 They kind of wander out of the way, okay?

922
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,840
 We are like that, the Bible says,

923
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,400
 but God, the good shepherd, comes to retrieve us.

924
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,200
 That he would leave behind those who were already found

925
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,540
 and go to a great distance to come to get us.

926
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,920
 And that he paid a great price

927
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,080
 so that we could know him and be forgiven

928
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,040
 and embrace real peace,

929
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,040
 peace that no amount of promotion or money or high

930
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,800
 or sexual fantasizing or conquering

931
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,060
 or whatever we put ourselves up to could ever offer.

932
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,280
 That Jesus actually climbed up on a cross,

933
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,360
 and when he was there,

934
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,160
 he wasn't just experiencing physical pain,

935
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,760
 he was experiencing the emotional and spiritual torment

936
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,320
 that we deserve as people who turned our back on God.

937
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,800
 But God wouldn't turn his back on us.

938
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,320
 He came to get us, and he paid for 100%.

939
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,760
 Think about this, 100% of the debt.

940
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,240
 I don't know if you've ever been in debt,

941
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,700
 medical, student, credit card, automobile.

942
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,880
 I have no idea if you've ever been in debt

943
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,300
 and what that feels like, but oh, to be free.

944
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,320
 You may not have known that your sin in your life

945
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,680
 creates a debt that you could never pay to God

946
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,200
 because of his perfection and because of where you are,

947
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,000
 but he closed the gap.

948
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,960
 He came all the way here.

949
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,920
 He lived a perfect life.

950
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,320
 He never messed up.

951
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,140
 I don't know if you knew that.

952
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,160
 You'll never get to the page of the Bible,

953
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,540
 like where's the one where Jesus messed up?

954
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,380
 It's just not in there.

955
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,560
 He lived a perfect life.

956
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,700
 And then he climbed on a cross,

957
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,520
 and he died a sufficient death,

958
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,880
 sufficient to bring us all to God.

959
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,200
 Who could do that?

960
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,640
 Could take a room this size, rooms this size,

961
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,320
 a world this size of this much complexity

962
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,960
 and this much confusion and bring us all to God.

963
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,880
 For what price?

964
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,880
 Free to us, expensive to him, but free to us by faith.

965
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,240
 That's the core of the church.

966
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,040
 It's how God built this for 2000 years,

967
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,840
 by telling people you're loved just as you are.

968
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,120
 And all of the morality of the Christian faith

969
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,320
 and all of the behavior of the Christian faith

970
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,120
 is just a reaction to God's love who loved you first,

971
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,880
 who came 100% of the way to get you.

972
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,760
 Not so that you could shape up,

973
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,560
 but so that you could know what love really is.

974
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,720
 It find life in life indeed.

975
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,080
 Let me pray for you.

976
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,840
 Father, thank you for our evening tonight.

977
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,080
 And God, I pray that if that sense of your love

978
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,480
 and your complete sufficient payment

979
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,520
 hasn't dawned on everyone who can hear my voice tonight,

980
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,480
 God, I pray that they would feel it, they would know.

981
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,640
 Not just so they can feel a feeling,

982
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,000
 but they can know a savior.

983
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,960
 They can know what love really is.

984
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,080
 Not the conditional thing we thought it was,

985
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,880
 where if we do well, we're rewarded.

986
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,840
 And if we don't do well, we're punished.

987
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,280
 But just to know that we've all not done well,

988
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,480
 but you've withheld punishment.

989
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,400
 Instead gave it to our substitute, Jesus.

990
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,960
 And now the way is clear for us to get to you.

991
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,680
 It might be counter-cultural.

992
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,480
 It might be counter-intuitive.

993
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,240
 It certainly is not anything we would have ever come up with

994
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,880
 but it's what you came up with.

995
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,880
 And it's your way of getting to us

996
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,960
 when we never wanted to get to you.

997
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,840
 Thank you, Jesus, that there is enough grace

998
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,840
 for everyone we know and even enough for us.

999
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,080
 In Jesus' name.

1000
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,360
