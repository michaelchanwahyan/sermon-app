[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:26.080]   - There you are, what's up, Porch?
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.760]   Hey, it's great to see ya.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.080]   Welcome back.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.920]   Man, it's good to have you in the room.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.560]   We're so glad that you would choose
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.640]   to be here with us tonight.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.880]   For all of you in Dallas, welcome.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.960]   And for all of you that are tuning in online,
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.380]   we're so glad you're here with us as well.
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.100]   We're firm believers that God is doing something,
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.640]   not just here in Dallas, Texas, though he is,
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.760]   but also all over the nation in cities
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.120]   and in places just like where you are right now.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.340]   So we're really glad that you're tuning in.
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.460]   If you're a part of our Porch Live family,
[00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.800]   we wanna give a special shout out to you.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.080]   We're so glad.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.160]   And a very special shout out to Porch Live,
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.840]   Wheaton, Springfield, and Greater Lafayette.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.440]   Can we give it up for 'em?
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.040]   There you are, amazing.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.980]   Hey, Porch, I am really excited for tonight
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.480]   because you are going to get to hear
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.240]   from one of my favorite Bible teachers on the planet.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.880]   I was processing what I wanted to say
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.960]   as I came up here and I gave an unnecessary endorsement
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.900]   to someone that's very familiar to all of you.
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.480]   And yet I wanted to take time and come up here
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.240]   and just tell you the person that you're hearing
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.200]   from tonight is easily one of the greatest
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.240]   spiritual influences in my own life.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.160]   Like I have been so personally impacted
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.040]   by way of his teaching and his ministry
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.400]   and his leadership and his shepherding.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.880]   He is the same person from here as he is down there.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.440]   And so you're gonna get to hear
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.040]   from the one and only Timothy Atik, TA, tonight.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.740]   [audience cheering]
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.140]   When Brooke and I were processing making the move
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.620]   from Houston, Texas to Dallas
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.420]   to take on this job here at The Porch,
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.620]   one of the primary reasons we made the move
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.420]   was because I wanted the chance to work with TA again.
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.740]   I wanted the chance to be led by him
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.900]   and I now have the joy of calling him my pastor.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.980]   TA is the lead pastor of vision and teaching
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.740]   here at Watermark Community Church.
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.780]   He was the interim director of The Porch
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.080]   for a season of time and he's here to speak to you tonight.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.700]   So would y'all do a great job of welcoming him to the stage.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.700]   [audience cheering]
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.220]   Thanks for being here, bro.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.040]   As TA comes, I'd love to pray for him
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.600]   and I'd love to pray for you, so let's pray together.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.980]   God, we're so grateful for tonight.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.800]   Already, God, in worship, I just sensed the nearness
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.760]   of your presence here in this room
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.240]   as we were declaring back to you, God,
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.480]   all the demonstrations and declarations of your love for us.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.300]   What impacted me in that moment was this idea
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.480]   that Kylan, if I would do all these things
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.220]   to save you and save them,
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.540]   why wouldn't you then believe I have something for you
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.100]   and for them tonight?
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.400]   Maybe you're here and you don't know why you are.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.940]   I believe it's because God has something for you.
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.600]   So would you take a moment and would you just pray
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.480]   for yourself where you are and ask
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.440]   that God would speak to you?
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.960]   Maybe it's been a long time since you've talked to him,
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.560]   but he's eager to listen.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.360]   Take a moment and pray for yourself.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:41.480]   If you would, take a moment and pray for TA.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.480]   As he comes to preach God's word, would you pray for him
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.980]   that everything he says would be true and helpful to us?
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.240]   (coughing)
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.060]   Well, God, we agree.
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.620]   There is none like you in heaven, on the earth,
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.980]   and under the earth.
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.820]   And so it's you that we listen to now.
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.700]   It's in Christ Jesus' name we pray.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.540]   Amen.
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.620]   Give it up for TA one more time.
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.120]   (congregation applauding)
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.260]   - Hey, good evening, Porch.
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.700]   It's so good to be here with you.
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.260]   Kylan, you said everything exactly how I told you to say it.
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.360]   So thank you.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.060]   Exactly how I wrote it for you.
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.180]   Hey, let me say this, and this is not just because
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.260]   of everything that Kylan just said to me.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.300]   I've known Kylan now for almost 10 years.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.500]   And I can honestly say that one of the greatest joys
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.120]   in ministry is getting to minister alongside him.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.120]   So I am so glad that God brought him here to Dallas
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.240]   and that you get to experience his leadership
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.180]   because he is a man who truly loves Jesus
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.180]   and is calling a generation to fully surrender to Jesus.
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.020]   So I'm just excited about what's happening here.
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.060]   Kylan and I talk about what is happening here on Tuesdays
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.360]   is leading the way for our church as a whole.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.460]   So I believe in your generation
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.520]   and what God is stirring inside of you
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.960]   and how he's using you to shape and inform
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.680]   what's happening at this church as a whole.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.120]   So it's great to be here with you tonight.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.760]   And I'm excited to talk about what we're talking about.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.800]   Prior to being here at Watermark,
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.840]   I was the executive director of Breakaway Ministries
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.040]   on the campus of Texas A&M University.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.160]   For the Aggies in the room.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.860]   And when I took over Breakaway,
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.280]   I took over Breakaway from a guy named Ben Stewart.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.800]   Many of you are familiar with Ben.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.840]   Ben is a very close friend.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.640]   He's truly one of,
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.880]   he's one of the greatest Bible teachers in our nation today.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.240]   But what I didn't realize is when I took over after Ben,
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.480]   what I didn't realize was that I would spend years
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.840]   fielding compliments for Ben Stewart.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.800]   Like no one told me that, no one made me aware of that.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.800]   But now I've come to realize that God's desire for me
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.600]   is to have people tell me what they think about Ben,
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.160]   which has been amazing.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.520]   And Ben and I joke about it.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.800]   So this is not an awkward thing right now.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.560]   Let me just give you some examples though
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.440]   of what I've gotten to hear about Ben over the years.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.600]   I remember this guy came up to me and was like,
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.360]   "Hey, TA, I just gotta tell you,
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.820]   "no one speaks to me like Ben Stewart."
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.840]   He's like, "You're good too, but man, nobody."
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.680]   It's like, "Oh, I got it.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.680]   "I heard it the first time you said it."
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.480]   I was speaking out of town in a different state
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.720]   and after I finished speaking, this girl came up to me
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.800]   and she was like, "Texas A&M University?"
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.960]   I was like, "Yeah."
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.260]   She was like, "Ben Stewart?"
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.920]   I was like, "Sure."
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.120]   She was like, "What do you think about him?"
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.960]   I was like, "Well, I think,"
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.840]   and she was like, "I think he's great."
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.320]   It's like, "I think he's great too.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.080]   "Ben is one of, truly, he's one of my favorite people
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.920]   "in the world, very close friend."
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.000]   Then I was speaking at a camp a few summers ago
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.880]   and I had only been there about an hour
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.200]   and this girl comes up to me and she was like,
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.040]   "You're from Breakaway?
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.800]   "I just love Ben Stewart."
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.560]   I was like, "I love Ben Stewart too."
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.120]   Another hour after that, this guy came up to me
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.440]   and he's like, "My wife's favorite speaker is Ben Stewart."
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.240]   It's like, "I'm so glad you told me that."
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.720]   And then at the same camp, just a few days later,
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.240]   I get a random text from a guy
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.240]   that I usually talk to about once a year.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.400]   So out of the blue, same camp that I've been at,
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.000]   I get a text from this guy.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.600]   Here's what his random text says to me.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.760]   He has some Aggie camp counselors staying at his house.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.960]   Here's what it says.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.820]   "Me too, Aggie camp counselor staying at my house.
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.400]   "Hey, do you know that Timothee guy?"
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.320]   Here's their response.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.160]   "Yeah, he's pretty good, but Ben Stewart was better."
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.800]   I was like, "You chose to send that."
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.600]   We haven't talked in a long time.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.520]   It's like, "You know what?
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.680]   "TA needs to hear this."
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.120]   It's just a part of it.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.840]   And Ben and I, we've talked about it.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.040]   We have joked about it.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.680]   But tonight, I wanna talk to you
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.800]   about how you deal with other people's success.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.120]   Like what I'm really talking about
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.600]   is how you respond to other people
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.600]   who just seem to be doing better at life than you.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.960]   Because here's the reality.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.280]   Ben and I, we can talk about this.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.720]   We can joke about it.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.040]   But there was a season of my life
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.800]   where I honestly really battled insecurity and jealousy
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.480]   when it came to Ben's success.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.920]   So my question to you is,
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.200]   how do you respond to coworkers, neighbors, roommates,
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.160]   friends, siblings, brother-in-laws, sister-in-laws,
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.880]   the guy you know about, but you don't really know him?
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.160]   How do you respond to those people
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.640]   who in the eyes of the world are smarter, funnier,
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.920]   skinnier, prettier, godlier, healthier, richer,
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.560]   more successful, more influential, more in shape,
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.680]   more likable, in just higher capacity than you?
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.160]   Who is that in your life?
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.200]   Like is someone just popping into your mind right now?
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.400]   Like put a name with it.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.920]   And if you're like, no one comes to mind,
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.000]   it's 'cause you're the guy that everyone's like,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.160]   I hate that guy.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:08.800]   Everything just works out for you.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.640]   Everything you touch turns to gold.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.640]   Everything about your life is perfect.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.320]   You've got the perfect physique, the perfect salary,
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.440]   the perfect vacations, everything is just perfect.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.580]   How do you deal with that?
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.820]   I wanna show you a story from the scriptures tonight,
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.200]   which is going to show us that there's honestly
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.780]   three ways you can respond.
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.200]   And I'll tell you what those three ways are right now.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.820]   The options are this, comparison, rejection,
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.560]   or celebration, okay?
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.480]   Those are the options.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.840]   Comparison, rejection, and celebration.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.180]   And just to not keep you guessing, the goal is celebration.
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.160]   But you have three options,
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.960]   comparison, rejection, celebration.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.440]   And I'm gonna show you these three things from a story
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.600]   from the life of King David.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.300]   So if you have a Bible, I wanna invite you to turn with me
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.280]   to 1 Samuel chapter 18.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.000]   If you're new to the porch, if you're new to the Bible,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.080]   I'm so glad that you made it tonight.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.920]   If you don't know much about what is happening
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.040]   in the Bible, then there's a chance that the only thing
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.880]   you know about David is that he is the guy who,
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.440]   the tale goes that he conquered a giant named Goliath.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.420]   And if you know that, you're in a pretty good place.
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.880]   But I'll fill it out for you a little bit more.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.640]   David was the second king ever of the nation of Israel.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.160]   He came after a guy named Saul.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.200]   Saul was a mediocre king.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.620]   We know that because God basically told him
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.940]   that he was mediocre.
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:52.160]   And because he was mediocre, God had made plans
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.320]   to replace Saul with a new king.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.720]   We know that that king turned out to be David.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.760]   But we're picking up a story where Saul is still king.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.160]   And this is the story where Saul is going to now find out
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.640]   that David is the king that God is going to replace him with.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.960]   The story that we're looking at comes right after
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.960]   1 Samuel 17, where David has his greatest conquest,
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.260]   which is conquering the giant named Goliath.
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.120]   So now we pick it up in 1 Samuel chapter 18.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.360]   I'm gonna read you a big chunk of scripture.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.560]   I'm gonna read you verses one through 16,
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.120]   and I would encourage you to follow along.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.340]   It says this.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.080]   It says, "As soon as he finished speaking to Saul,
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.660]   "the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David,
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:49.400]   "and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.700]   "And Saul took him that day and would not let him
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.300]   "return to his father's house.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.600]   "Then Jonathan made a covenant with David
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.040]   "because he loved him as his own soul.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.940]   "And Jonathan stripped himself of the road that was on him
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.700]   "and gave it to David and his armor,
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.640]   "and even his sword and his bow and his belt.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.320]   "And David went out and was successful
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.140]   "wherever Saul sent him so that Saul set him
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:13.980]   "over the men of war.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.580]   "And this was good in the sight of all the people
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.040]   "and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.700]   "As they were coming home, when David returned
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.800]   "from striking down the Philistine," that's Goliath,
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.000]   "the women came out of all the cities of Israel
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.940]   "singing and dancing to meet King Saul,
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.140]   "with tambourines, with songs of joy,
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.720]   "and with musical instruments.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.500]   "And the women sang to one another as they celebrated.
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.180]   "Saul was struck down as thousands,
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.080]   "and David as ten thousands, and Saul was very angry,
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.780]   "and this saying displeased him.
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.180]   "He said, 'They've ascribed to David ten thousands,
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.900]   "'and to me they've ascribed thousands,
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.060]   "'and what more can he have but the kingdom?'
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.720]   "And Saul eyed David from that day on.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.100]   "The next day, a harmful spirit from God rushed upon Saul,
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.720]   "and he raved within his house
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.300]   "while David was playing the liar, as he did day by day.
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.740]   "Saul had his spear in his hand,
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.380]   "and Saul hurled the spear,
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.020]   "for he thought, 'I will pin David to the wall.'
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.640]   "But David evaded him twice.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.240]   "Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with him,
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.780]   "but had departed from Saul.
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.000]   "So Saul removed him from his presence
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.060]   "and made him a commander of a thousand,
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.300]   "and he went out and came in before the people.
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.580]   "And David had success in all his undertakings,
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.100]   "for the Lord was with him.
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.320]   "And when Saul saw that he had great success,
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.780]   "he stood in fearful awe of him.
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.820]   "But all Israel and Judah loved David,
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.040]   "for he went out and came in before them."
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.780]   So that was a lot,
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:52.700]   but this is a story about how two different individuals
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.700]   respond to David's success.
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.500]   The reason I can say that this is a story
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.380]   about David's success is because of the repeated words.
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.280]   So if you want a helpful tip
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.500]   when you're studying the Bible,
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.260]   pay attention to the words that the author repeats,
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.380]   because authors repeat what they want emphasized.
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.460]   Let me repeat that.
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.140]   Authors repeat what they want emphasized.
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.620]   We see that in verse five.
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.300]   "David went out and was successful
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.580]   "wherever Saul sent him."
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.360]   Verse 14, "David had success in all his undertakings,
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.420]   "for the Lord was with him."
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:29.020]   Verse 15, "When Saul saw that he had great success,
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.500]   "he stood in fearful awe of him."
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.440]   It's a story about David's success.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:37.180]   Now we're going to see how Saul responds to David's success
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.160]   and how Jonathan responds to David's success.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.800]   What's interesting is that Saul and Jonathan
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.160]   are from the same family.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.940]   Saul is Jonathan's dad,
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.760]   but these two people from the same family
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.100]   have two very different responses to David's success.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.500]   Saul is going to respond first with comparison,
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.860]   and then he's gonna respond with rejection,
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.260]   and then his son Jonathan
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.780]   is going to respond with celebration.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:07.820]   So let's just unpack these three responses.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.840]   The first way that you can respond to someone's success
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.160]   is with comparison.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.740]   I'm going to define comparison tonight
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:19.740]   as ranking God's will for your life against others.
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:24.100]   It's ranking God's will for your life against others.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.220]   Where do we see comparison in the story?
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.500]   Well, we see it in verse eight.
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.900]   Look back at it.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.180]   Remember what is happening?
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.580]   David is coming home from conquering the giant.
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.980]   Saul is coming home with his army as well.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.700]   Women come out from the town.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.860]   They begin to sing.
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.940]   They begin to bang tambourines.
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.580]   They begin to sing songs
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.980]   in which they declare certain things
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.180]   about David and about Saul.
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.380]   Verse eight tells us this.
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.740]   "Saul was very angry."
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.400]   Why was he angry?
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.900]   "And this saying displeased him."
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.380]   What was the saying that displeased him?
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.500]   He said, "They have ascribed to David 10,000s,
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.360]   "and to me they have ascribed thousands.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.300]   "And what more can he have but the kingdom?"
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.460]   Do you see the comparison?
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.140]   Saul begins to compare the praise that David receives
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.620]   with the praise that he receives.
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.220]   They are declaring that David is a guy
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.620]   who's conquered 10,000s,
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.620]   and he's a guy who has conquered thousands.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.720]   And just from this moment right here,
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.560]   we learn two different things about comparison,
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.760]   so don't miss 'em.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.760]   The first one is that comparison feeds on er and as.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.500]   No one's saying amen to that,
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.200]   so I probably should explain that.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.600]   Okay, comparison feeds.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.000]   It's nourished by it.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.960]   It finds life in er and as.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.320]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:53.680]   One pastor referred to our need
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.540]   for what he called the er factor.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.440]   Like we wanna know that we are smart-er,
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.560]   strong-er, pretty-er, funny-er,
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.800]   wealthy-er, skinny-er, godly-er,
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.640]   successful-er than the people around us.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.120]   We want that.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.920]   Follow me on this.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:20.160]   Women come out from the city
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.080]   to meet and sing songs to who?
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.280]   I'm asking.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.280]   Saul.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.900]   The text is really clear.
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:36.900]   It says that women came out from the town
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:41.440]   to sing songs to Saul.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.360]   They come out and they play tambourines for Saul.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.240]   Men, let me ask you,
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.440]   when's the last time a girl played the tambourine for you?
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.400]   Never, why?
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.160]   'Cause you're not important enough for a girl
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.720]   to play the tambourine for you.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.800]   Saul was.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.440]   So these girls come out, they write a song,
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.360]   they're playing a tambourine to Saul.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.200]   And in their song, they actually declare
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.040]   that Saul is a conquering king.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.320]   Yes, they do say that David has conquered his 10,000s,
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.280]   but they also say that Saul has shrugged down his thousands.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.720]   So they're declaring him to be a conquering king.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.720]   The issue was not that Saul wanted to be great,
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.360]   because they're declaring him to be great.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.560]   The issue is that Saul wanted to be greater.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.520]   And that's where things began to unravel for him.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.760]   He didn't wanna just be great, he wanted to be greater.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:46.120]   And for some of you, that's what's happening in your life,
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.720]   is you don't wanna just be great,
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.400]   you wanna be able to look around in insecurity
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.080]   at the people around you, and you just need to know
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.920]   that you have the Ur-factor over them.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.400]   It gives you some sense of significance.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.960]   It makes you feel strong.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.720]   It makes you feel significant when you know
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.640]   that you're stronger than that other person at the gym,
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.600]   that you are more likable,
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.680]   that people want you more than they want her.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.000]   That you're skinnier.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   That you're more successful.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.800]   That you take better vacations.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.240]   And something in you just needs that.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.360]   See, comparison feeds on the Ur-factor,
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.200]   but some of you are hearing that and you're like,
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:35.200]   I don't, that's just not me, I don't feel that.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.840]   Like, I don't look around and need to have the Ur-factor
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.320]   over people, well, for you, it might be a need
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.200]   for the As-factor.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.120]   What I mean by that is that you've decided in your own mind
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.160]   what the ideal is.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.960]   And so you just find people in the world
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.240]   that you think represent the ideal,
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.320]   and you think to yourself, if I could just be
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.640]   as likable as that person,
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:06.800]   if I could just be as influential as that person,
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.720]   if I could just be as successful as that person,
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.600]   then I would truly be enough.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.560]   Let me just identify one problem with the Ur-factor
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.480]   and one problem with the As-factor.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.280]   Problem with the Ur-factor is while you'll always
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.000]   have the Ur-factor over some people,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.680]   someone will always have the Ur-factor over you.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.440]   And if you haven't found that person, just wait longer.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.720]   The problem with the As-factor
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.800]   is that perfection is an illusion.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:44.800]   Perception is hardly ever reality.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.520]   Some of you all have seen this before,
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.480]   but this is the Atik family Christmas card
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.760]   from a while back.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:59.920]   And you know what, I wish we had time to just form a line
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.440]   for y'all to each walk by,
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:07.640]   just to glance at an incredible family.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.160]   Like, if you want to see a family that's crushing life,
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.640]   this is it.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.640]   Like you would see Noah was in second grade this time.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.480]   He was crushing second grade.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.360]   Andrew, the time, kindergarten,
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.360]   just smoking people in kindergarten.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.880]   And then like there's baby Jake,
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.240]   who I guarantee you deserved a baby modeling contract.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.880]   We just think people were having a hard time
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.960]   getting ahold of us.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.520]   And you know what the good news is?
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.960]   Like, bam, we're just getting started here, people.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.720]   Like this thing keeps going.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:55.800]   Like there's just so much amazingness to us.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.040]   Like sometimes I'm amazed at how amazing we are.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.840]   We're awesome.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.080]   Okay.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:08.960]   Do you want to know what was happening
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.920]   on either side of the button being pressed
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.560]   on the camera taking these pictures?
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:19.560]   Well, on the front end, I was all over my kids.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.720]   It's like, get off the ground.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.560]   Stop messing around with each other.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.640]   Stop tilting your head in a weird way.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.760]   Like look at the camera and smile.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.640]   I was all over.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:35.360]   On the back end, well, we took those pictures
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.600]   in about 20 mile an hour winds
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.080]   and something blew into the eye of Jake,
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.520]   who was about four months old at the time.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.360]   And it cost us about a thousand dollar trip to the ER.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.000]   So I would say we were crushing life.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.600]   Do you know what year this Christmas card was?
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.240]   This was 2017.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.840]   Do you want to know why I brought the 2017 Christmas card?
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.840]   'Cause we haven't sent out Christmas cards since 2017.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.840]   We didn't even finish sending them out in 2017.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.240]   Why?
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.240]   'Cause sometimes the Atik family
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.800]   is just barely holding it together.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.520]   There are some days that we are just so day to day.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.680]   It's just reality.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.040]   And yet you can look at this and be like,
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.240]   you know what, if we just had what they had.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.920]   Have you ever thought that the people
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.680]   that you're looking at as the ideal,
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.360]   what if they're looking at someone else as the ideal?
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.680]   Isn't that crazy to think about?
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.560]   If you want to feel a little bit crazy,
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.480]   just think the person that you think is the ideal
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.560]   is discontent with themselves,
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.000]   wishing that they had what someone else had.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.640]   That's comparison.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.160]   And it's a thief of joy.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:53.460]   The first thing that we find out
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.560]   is that comparison feeds on urn ads.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.960]   The second thing that we find out
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.840]   is that comparison has terrible side effects.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.200]   It has terrible side effects.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.640]   You know those ads that show up
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.600]   like they're like medication commercials.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.040]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.720]   I'm always so surprised at the activities
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.160]   that people are doing on those medicine commercials.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.480]   Just next time you see one, be like,
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:24.040]   "Man, I never thought about the glass blowing business
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:28.600]   "in how that guy will need that medicine in his occupation."
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.720]   Or like, you know, someone's like wrestling with their dog
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.960]   or sitting in a bathtub on a beach
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.720]   next to someone else in a bathtub.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.400]   And it's like, "Where'd those bathtubs come from?
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.520]   "Like, did you just walk out and find them?"
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.760]   And it's like, "Let's get into them."
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.060]   That's, as a germ freak, that's horrifying.
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:51.360]   But there's like that soft, soothing voice
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.960]   at the end of the commercial that tells you the side effects.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:57.000]   It's like, "Talk to your doctor before trying this medicine.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.160]   "It can cause nausea, diarrhea, vomiting,
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.360]   "demon possession, or even death."
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.900]   And it's like, "Wow. [audience laughing]
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.260]   "Those are some serious side effects."
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:11.200]   Comparison has terrible side effects.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.720]   Verse eight, Saul was very angry.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.640]   Verse nine, Saul eyed David from that day on.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:20.040]   So comparison fueled suspicion and paranoia.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.120]   Verse 12, Saul was afraid of David,
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.420]   caused him to live a life of fear.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.320]   Like the event that we're looking at in 1 Samuel 18,
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.320]   this is the event where Saul's life
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.040]   began to circle the drain.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.760]   Like, if you were to keep reading on,
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.240]   you know what you would find?
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.160]   Comparison led Saul to spend the rest of his life
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.840]   trying to kill David,
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:47.320]   which led to Saul losing the respect of his son,
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.120]   his daughter, and his men.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.100]   In the end, Saul committed suicide.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.680]   Comparison produced terrible side effects in Saul's life,
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:59.120]   and it'll produce terrible effects in our lives.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.640]   Like, you're gonna experience competition,
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:06.640]   pride, envy, jealousy, anxiety, and exhaustion.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.840]   Comparison isn't a medicine, it's a poison.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.440]   I know this 'cause I've lived it.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:18.140]   You know what it took me far too long to understand?
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:22.480]   It took me way too long to understand
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.840]   that the cross of Christ does what comparison can't.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.560]   Do you wanna know why we compare?
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:34.200]   Leon Festinger popularized the social comparison theory.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.160]   Do you wanna know why we compare?
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.980]   Because we're trying to determine our value.
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:44.040]   We're trying to figure out how we stack up value-wise
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.100]   in comparison to other people.
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:51.520]   But if that's how you determine your value,
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.620]   your value's gonna consistently be fluctuating.
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.800]   You know what the cross of Jesus Christ does?
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:01.160]   Is it places value on you.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.000]   That's permanent.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.400]   So when we look at the cross of Jesus Christ,
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.240]   we first find the infinite value of Jesus Christ,
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:12.840]   because Jesus Christ is so infinitely valuable
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.160]   that what we find on the cross of Christ
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.480]   is the eternal Son of God leaving heaven,
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.920]   coming to earth, living perfectly,
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.900]   dying sacrificially, and rising victoriously.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:31.300]   So the cross declares Christ's infinite value.
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.400]   But on that cross,
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.620]   Jesus Christ was making payment for you and for me.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.340]   That's why 1 Corinthians 6 says that you and I,
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.880]   we were bought at a price.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.020]   What was the price?
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.220]   It was the body and blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:50.380]   So it's not that you earn your value from God,
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.340]   it's that God in His infinite love and grace
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.920]   decides to place value on you.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:00.100]   So what is the value that is handed to you freely?
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:04.620]   You are now valued at the body and blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.180]   Okay, all right.
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.840]   Let me say that one more time.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.820]   Because maybe,
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:17.780]   I don't know anything more important I can tell you tonight.
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.900]   If you want to know what you're worth,
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:28.980]   God has decided to give you your worth.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.940]   That now never changes.
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:37.900]   So God has decided to make you worth
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:42.900]   the body and blood of the eternal Son of God.
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:48.340]   Did you just let that sink in?
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:52.060]   Which means you don't have to run out into the world
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.860]   asking them to give you something
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.440]   that God freely gives you in Christ.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:03.020]   Second option is rejection.
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:08.860]   So if comparison is ranking God's will for your life
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:13.860]   against others, then rejection is saying no to God's will
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.120]   for your life and others.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.380]   That's what rejection is.
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.980]   It's just saying God, no.
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.780]   I don't want that for them and I don't want that for me.
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.380]   Where do we see that in the story?
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.100]   Well, again, verse eight, it says,
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.420]   "And Saul was very angry and this saying displeased him.
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:32.220]   "He said, 'They've ascribed to David 10,000s,
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.940]   "'and to me they've ascribed thousands.'"
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:38.940]   Watch this, "And what more can he have but the kingdom?"
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.620]   So this is the moment where things are beginning
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.100]   to become clear for Saul, where he's realizing
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.380]   that David is actually the guy
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:49.300]   that God is going to replace him with as king.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.820]   And what does Saul say?
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.580]   Hey, what more can he have but the kingdom?
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.500]   This is Saul saying, I see what you're doing, God,
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.000]   and I reject it.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.400]   I say no to it.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.420]   Then in verse 10, look at what it says.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.300]   It says, "The next day, a harmful spirit from God
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.460]   "rushed upon Saul."
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.740]   That can be really concerning to read.
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:13.900]   Here's what I want you to know about that harmful spirit.
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:17.580]   Don't think that this harmful spirit
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:22.380]   is an evil demon aligned with Satan.
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:26.340]   No, this is a specific consequence from God.
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:30.620]   This is an angel that God has assigned specifically
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:35.620]   for Saul's disobedience as the king of the nation of Israel.
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.900]   The way that God dealt with the nation of Israel
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.180]   was very specific in the Old Testament.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.860]   This is a specific consequence for King Saul
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:49.160]   as the king of the nation of Israel.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.660]   Each time the harmful spirit is mentioned,
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.260]   it's mentioned back in chapter 16,
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.340]   it's mentioned ahead in chapter 19,
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.740]   each time it's mentioned,
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:04.740]   David's success in God's favor upon him is being discussed.
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:08.980]   Saul tries to kill David twice.
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.500]   Why?
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.100]   Because he rejects God's will.
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.620]   So back to verses 10 through 12.
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.180]   "The next day, a harmful spirit from God
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.140]   "rushed upon Saul.
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.860]   "He raved within his house while David was playing the liar
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.100]   "as he did day by day.
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.180]   "Saul had his spear in his hand and Saul hurled the spear
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.780]   "for he thought, 'I will pin David to the wall.'
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:29.020]   "But David evaded him twice."
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.500]   It always makes me laugh that it says
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.540]   David evaded him twice.
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:37.660]   I'm like, David, after the first time, it's like peace.
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:41.180]   You know, like it's been fun, but I'm out.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.340]   He's stuck around.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.820]   But Saul is trying to kill him, why?
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.860]   Because he rejects God's plan.
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.940]   Verse 13, it says, "So Saul removed him from his presence
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.380]   "and made him a commander of a thousand.
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.180]   "And he went out and came in before the people."
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.140]   So Saul makes David a commander,
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.740]   and you might hear that and think,
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.620]   oh, well, that's pretty nice.
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.100]   Saul gives David a promotion.
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.820]   No, this isn't a promotion, this is a tactic.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.820]   Because Saul is thinking, okay,
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.060]   David had success once when conquering a giant,
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.460]   but let's see what happens
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.940]   when he has to lead an army of a thousand.
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:23.260]   What if he doesn't have the leadership capability
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.140]   and he fails in people's eyes?
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:28.340]   Better yet, what if he goes into battle and gets killed?
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:33.140]   This is a tactic to take David out.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:34.140]   What was God's will?
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.820]   It was for David to fade in and Saul to fade out,
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:41.820]   and Saul is emphatically declaring, I reject that.
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.180]   That's what rejection is.
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:48.740]   It's saying no to God's will for your life and others.
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.140]   How does this play out in our lives?
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:55.100]   How do we reject God's will for our life and others?
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.580]   Well, the main way that you will see this crop up
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.340]   in your life is through subtle resentment.
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.840]   You'll resent other people's successes
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:10.500]   because you believe that their success makes you a failure.
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:14.060]   And then you resent God for not giving you
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.960]   more of what others have.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.140]   Do you see what you're doing there?
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.820]   You're rejecting God's will for their life.
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:23.180]   I resent their success because their success
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:24.980]   is saying something about me.
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:29.060]   And God, I resent you and I reject your will for my life
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.140]   because you should have given me more
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.640]   what you gave to them.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.400]   Another way this shows up is isolation.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.360]   Like you'll just keep people at a distance
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.160]   because they're your competition.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:45.200]   Jesus has to be our example.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.360]   We find Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.200]   on the night that he's betrayed, praying,
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.680]   God, not my will, but your will be done.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.960]   What was God's will for Jesus?
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.480]   To be crucified for the sins of the world.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.380]   What was God's will for Christians?
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.800]   That we who were rebellious towards God
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.320]   would be saved through the death, burial,
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.980]   and resurrection of his son.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.040]   Those who were spiritually dead
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.920]   would be awakened to life with God.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:22.800]   And Jesus says, yes, I will die so that they can live.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.680]   Jesus has to be our example.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.280]   The Christian life is a surrendered life.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.240]   The Christian life is just opening up your hands
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.720]   and saying, God, I accept and I receive
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.120]   whatever you give to me,
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.920]   and I say yes to whatever you give to them.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.740]   God, you don't exist for me, I exist for you,
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:47.120]   so you can have your way in my life.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.760]   Whatever you wanna do through me,
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.560]   however you wanna use me, God,
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.520]   I trust that you have wired me and gifted me
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.120]   with everything that you want me to have,
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.720]   and I'm committed to cultivating the talents
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.440]   that you have instilled in me,
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.520]   and I will do it to your glory.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.720]   And if there's other people who do it better,
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.800]   then God bless them, but my responsibility
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.560]   is to be faithful with what you have entrusted to me.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.500]   That's the Christian life.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.660]   [audience applauding]
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:22.080]   Which leads to the third way to respond to people's success.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.360]   So you've got three options,
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.280]   comparison, rejection, or celebration.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.400]   You know what celebration is.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.960]   Celebration is a resounding yes to God's will
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.460]   for your life and others.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:35.000]   And we see this surprisingly
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.480]   in the life of Saul's son, Jonathan.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.920]   Who was Jonathan?
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:43.480]   Jonathan was Saul's oldest son.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.340]   Do you know what that means?
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.840]   It means that Jonathan was actually
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.720]   the next in line for the throne.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.520]   Jonathan was the one who was supposed to be
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.200]   the next king of Israel.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:02.040]   So if anyone had a reason to be paranoid about David
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:06.120]   and to reject any thought of David being king,
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.680]   it would have been Jonathan.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.640]   And yet, what do we find Jonathan doing
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.200]   all the way back in verses three and four?
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.600]   It says, "Then Jonathan made a covenant with David
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.280]   "because he loved him as his own soul."
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.640]   Watch this, this is amazing.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.800]   Verse four, "Jonathan stripped himself of the robe
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.520]   "that was on him and gave it to David,
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.040]   "and his armor, and even his sword,
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.200]   "and his bow, and his belt."
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.800]   Here's what you need to understand.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.640]   Think about this, process this.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.560]   The clothes that Jonathan is wearing,
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.040]   they are royalty.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:41.360]   That is a part of what defines him
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.280]   as part of the royal family.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.120]   So when Jonathan strips himself of his robe
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.400]   and gives it to David, when he takes off his royal armor,
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:55.120]   when he takes his royal sword and he hands it to David,
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.960]   do you know what he's declaring?
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.280]   He is declaring, "You rule and reign instead.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.580]   "You're the rightful king, not me.
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.640]   "Not me, the one who is the successor to the throne.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.240]   "In man's eyes, no, we're gonna do things
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.140]   "according to what is in God's eyes.
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.480]   "You're the future king."
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.560]   And I celebrate that.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.080]   This is Jonathan's resounding yes to God's will
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:24.840]   for his life and David's.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.080]   And as I've processed Jonathan's relationship with David,
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.960]   there's three things that I take away from it
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.920]   that I hope you don't miss.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:32.880]   Here's the first thing.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.480]   Instead of seeing people for their success,
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.600]   see them for their stewardship.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.560]   Instead of seeing people for their success,
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:44.040]   see people for their stewardship.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:48.840]   David was called by God to steward the throne of Israel.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:53.680]   So instead of resenting David, Jonathan supported David.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:58.680]   Everything someone has been given to them by God
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:03.760]   has been given by God for them to steward for God's glory.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.400]   And they will have to give an account
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.280]   for what they did with what God gave to them.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.040]   So when I think about my friend, Ben Stewart,
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:16.920]   I'm like, instead of comparing or rejecting,
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.000]   I wanna celebrate.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   Like God has wired Ben in such a sweet and unique way
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:27.480]   and he has put Ben in the capital city of our country
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.280]   and he's given Ben this ability to speak
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.800]   in a very clear and winsome and compelling way
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.720]   to people in positions of power.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.680]   So instead of seeing Ben for his success,
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.160]   I should see him for his stewardship
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.440]   because one day he will have to give an account
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.920]   for what he did with what God entrusted to him.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:49.080]   So the best thing I can do is to pray for my friend, Ben.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.360]   The same is true for me.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.080]   The same is true for every single person
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:53.920]   in this room.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.480]   God has given each one of us brains and bodies
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.920]   and mouths and hands and feet and feelings,
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.320]   senses of humor, talents and giftings to steward.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.320]   And one day you will give an account
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:10.080]   for how you stewarded the things God gave to you.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:13.680]   So if that's the case, we don't have time to waste
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.320]   wishing that we had what someone else had.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:21.040]   We don't have time to waste comparing or resenting.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.560]   The second thing I learned from Jonathan
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.560]   is the death of who you're supposed to be
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.880]   is often the birth of who you were made to be.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:32.320]   The death of who you're supposed to be
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.920]   is often the birth of who you were made to be.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:41.600]   At some point, Jonathan let the dream of being king die.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:49.920]   He had to let go of the dream of who he was told
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:50.880]   he was supposed to be.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.720]   He grew up.
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:56.720]   I guarantee he grew up believing that he would be king.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.120]   That's who he was supposed to be.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.760]   That's who his dad told him he was supposed to be.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:07.760]   But God's plans were for Jonathan
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.960]   to be David's greatest support.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:16.360]   So I just want you to think about that real quick.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.600]   Who have you been told you're supposed to be?
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.440]   Just think about that.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.400]   Who have your parents told you you're supposed to be?
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.080]   Who does social media tell you you're supposed to be?
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.760]   Who have you been told you're supposed to be?
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:31.720]   Or who have you told yourself you're supposed to be?
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.520]   You're supposed to be CEO or president of something.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.880]   You're supposed to be rich
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.440]   with multiple houses and nice cars.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.440]   You're supposed to be someone on Forbes' 30 under 30 list.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.120]   You're supposed to be an influencer
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.240]   with hundreds of thousands of followers.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.520]   You're supposed to be someone who works 60 hours a week
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:51.320]   and have ton of friends and tons of plans
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.400]   and great vacations and still somehow crush
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.160]   every single aspect of life.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:00.040]   Sometimes the death of who you're supposed to be
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.480]   will be the birth of who you were made to be.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:09.200]   When I became the executive director of Breakaway in 2016,
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:14.320]   because of the directors that preceded me,
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:19.320]   I started believing that because of my position,
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:24.200]   I needed to be, this is who I believed I was supposed to be.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:28.200]   I believed I needed to be one of the wisest,
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.720]   most strategic, most godly, most creative,
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.280]   most intelligent, most interesting,
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.160]   most captivating leaders, authors, communicators,
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.800]   and pastors in the nation.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.920]   And I'll tell you what, it was crushing.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.840]   It was a crushing weight to carry.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.320]   It was exhausting.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.320]   Do you know where freedom was found?
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:55.760]   Freedom was found in embracing who God had called me to be.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:59.000]   God hasn't called me to be anyone
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.160]   other than a faithful servant of the king.
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:08.160]   The third thing I learned from Jonathan is this,
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.940]   others don't have to lose in order for you to win.
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:16.580]   I remember running on the treadmill at the gym years ago.
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.220]   I say that just so you think that I go to the gym.
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:24.180]   But I remember running on the treadmill
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.060]   and it was like God just slapped me on the side of the head,
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:28.420]   like in a loving way.
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:32.900]   But I felt like I heard God so clearly in that moment.
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.420]   And here's what I felt like he said,
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.100]   you need everyone else to be a failure
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:38.100]   so that you can feel like a success.
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:44.900]   Here's the reality, Jonathan still won.
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:48.300]   Today when pastors preach on friendship,
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:51.400]   do you know who is held up as the ideal model?
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.940]   Jonathan.
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.560]   There's enough room in this world
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.900]   for more than one person to win.
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:58.080]   And honestly, it's not about you and me winning.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.660]   Christ is already won.
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:02.300]   We live to exalt the one who has conquered
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.700]   Satan, sin and death.
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:09.300]   Every single person here has the potential
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.980]   of living a faithful life in the eyes of God.
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:16.520]   What does God celebrate?
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:20.900]   God doesn't celebrate fame, he celebrates faithfulness.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.500]   When you cross into heaven,
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.420]   what words are you expecting to hear?
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:27.740]   Well done, good and famous servant.
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:29.700]   Good luck with that.
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.920]   Well done, good and high capacity servant.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.960]   Nope.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:39.180]   Well done, good and wealthy servant.
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:43.180]   Well done, good and like in shape,
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.980]   crushing the CrossFit open servant.
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.220]   No.
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:52.180]   Well done, good and faithful servant.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:53.580]   That's what God celebrates.
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:59.200]   Steward the life and purpose you have been given.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.900]   Let me just encourage you.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:06.580]   I encourage you tonight to sit with the Lord
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:09.060]   and just ask him to reveal any relationships
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.340]   in your life where you've given
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.780]   into comparison or rejection.
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.620]   Like if someone comes to mind,
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:15.620]   I would just encourage you,
[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.140]   ask the Lord for forgiveness here.
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:23.560]   Like find a way to encourage that person this week.
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.700]   And then thank God for the value
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:29.080]   that Christ's cross gives to you.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.420]   Thank him for how he made you.
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.620]   Thank him for the plans that he has for you.
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:35.600]   And then I would encourage you to wake up
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:39.200]   and thank God for the value he's placed on you
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.480]   and say yes to the plans that he has for you today.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.760]   Just say yes.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:48.680]   But I'll tell you this,
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:52.120]   it would be such a failure of a message
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.120]   if we just closed up right here.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:58.120]   Because when you study someone like David,
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.360]   the goal is to learn from David,
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.440]   but the goal is also to look through David
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:03.660]   to the greater David.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:06.960]   And that's Jesus Christ, the greater David.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.860]   Because here's the way that David and Jesus are so similar.
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.240]   Just as David rose to fame, Jesus Christ rose to fame.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.240]   Just as Saul sought to thwart God's will for David's life,
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.680]   Satan through Pharisees and Sadducees
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:24.680]   sought to thwart God's will for Jesus' life.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.520]   Saul tried to put David to death.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:31.420]   Roman soldiers actually did put Jesus to death.
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:34.480]   But just as David was God's anointed,
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:39.200]   Jesus was and is the Christ, the anointed one.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.880]   And just as David went out and came in victorious,
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:46.320]   Jesus Christ went out from heaven, came to earth,
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.120]   conquered Satan's sin and death for you and for me
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.520]   through his life, through his death,
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.960]   through his resurrection,
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:57.280]   he's made a way for those who had no way back to God.
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.800]   He's kicked open the door into the family of God
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.360]   for you and for me.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.840]   And while David eventually became king for 40 years,
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.020]   Jesus Christ rose from the dead victorious
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:11.800]   as the King of kings and the Lord of lords
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.440]   for all of eternity.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:18.640]   So when it comes to how you respond
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:21.720]   to Jesus, the greater David,
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.520]   you're either gonna respond like Saul
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.720]   or you're gonna respond like Jonathan.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:32.640]   Jonathan stripped himself of the throne
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.200]   because he knew it wasn't his in the first place.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:38.800]   The right response to Jesus Christ,
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.480]   the King of kings and Lord of lords
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.040]   is to come to him and to say,
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.440]   "Jesus Christ, you're king, I'm not.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.480]   "You get to rule and reign over my heart
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:47.740]   "and my entire life.
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:52.600]   "My life belongs to you, it doesn't belong to me.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.400]   "Let's not play games.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:00.440]   "Let's not just make Jesus a part of our lives.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.680]   "He's either the point of your life
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.680]   "or you have no life."
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:10.900]   Or you can respond to Jesus like Saul.
[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:15.740]   You can grasp for a throne that doesn't belong to you.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:19.340]   And you can insist on your own way
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:21.340]   and you can buy into the mirage of life
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:22.580]   where you're in control.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.760]   You need to know you being in control of your life
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.240]   is never even an option.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.240]   Either Jesus Christ will be in control
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.800]   or sin will be in control.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:38.500]   But you being in control isn't even on the table.
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.460]   My hope and prayer is that the young adults
[00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:43.860]   of the porch here in Dallas and all over the nation
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:47.600]   would just be a generation that rises up
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:50.240]   among their peers and just declares,
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:53.420]   "There is one king and his name is Jesus.
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.480]   "He's the king of my heart and he should be
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.320]   "the king of yours."
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.320]   Let's pray together.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:09.780]   If that's you tonight,
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:15.280]   if you're sitting there just realizing
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:19.560]   and you just sense like God's pressing
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.280]   on your heart right now,
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.480]   that God is reaching into your life,
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:26.100]   just saying, "Look, I want you to be mine.
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:29.160]   "I want you to be mine."
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.320]   If that's you tonight,
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.220]   then I just wanna invite you right now
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.320]   to just say yes to Jesus,
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.280]   to give your life over to him,
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.800]   to just say, "Jesus Christ."
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.920]   You can just pray this in your own heart.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.920]   Just say, "Lord Jesus, would you come into my life tonight?
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:47.160]   "Thank you that you died on the cross for me.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.760]   "Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.840]   "Would you come into my life?
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.860]   "Would you forgive me of my sins?
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:00.060]   "And would you lead me in a new life?"
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:07.040]   And then if you already know Jesus as king,
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:10.720]   would you just invite him to reveal
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:13.040]   that the aspects of your heart,
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:17.080]   where there's still comparison or rejection,
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.040]   and would you just ask him right now
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.240]   that by the power of the spirit,
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.920]   he would strengthen you
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:28.280]   towards celebration?
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:32.200]   God, I thank you for the young adults in this room,
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.940]   all over the nation right now.
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:38.720]   My hope and prayer is that you, God,
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.640]   would rule and reign in every heart.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.960]   If there's anyone whose heart is still cold to you,
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.980]   would you just light it up right now?
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:49.360]   Warm it up in the name of Jesus.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:54.640]   And I pray that workplaces would be different tomorrow,
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.720]   gyms would be different tomorrow,
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.600]   apartment complexes would be different tomorrow,
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:04.600]   because there's a critical mass of people
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:09.680]   who are just owning the calling on their lives
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.880]   and celebrating the calling on other people's lives.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:17.900]   There's no comparison, there's no envy, no jealousy,
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.560]   no resentment,
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:24.840]   just a bunch of young adults saying,
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.640]   "Look, I've got one life,
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:29.300]   "and I'm clear on who God has made me to be,
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:32.260]   "so I'm gonna run this race in a way that I win."
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:36.280]   And that's exalting Christ through my life.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:41.160]   Use the people for your glory, I pray, in Jesus' name.
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:43.400]   Amen.
