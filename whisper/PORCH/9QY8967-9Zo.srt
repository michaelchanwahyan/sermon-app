1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:21,160
 How we doing porch?

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,560
 Come on, come on.

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,140
 If you're listening anywhere you are,

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,260
 if someone just led you in worship,

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,440
 wherever you are, be it Fort Worth, Houston,

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,640
 Cedar Rapids, wherever,

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,140
 can we just applaud the way that they use their talents

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,000
 to stir our affections for God?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,500
 (congregation applauding)

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,580
 Late last week, I was at lunch with two other pastors.

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,780
 One was Todd Wagner, senior pastor here,

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,100
 and another pastor friend.

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,740
 And we were eating at a restaurant

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,340
 we haven't eaten at before.

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,340
 And so there, we kind of engaged the server, right?

17
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,500
 Like here's the reality,

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,940
 he doesn't have a chance of not hearing the gospel.

19
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,140
 Like we're gonna talk about Jesus one way or another.

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,540
 That's about to happen.

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,460
 And so Todd engages him first and says,

22
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,940
 "Hey, you know, man, do you mind if I ask you

23
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,260
 "a couple of questions?"

24
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,500
 And the guy's out thinking like,

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,340
 "Yeah, sure."

26
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,780
 Like, "What salad dressing do we have?"

27
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,420
 Or, "What's the soup of the day?"

28
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,300
 You know, and he's like, "Let me ask you this.

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,160
 "What comes to mind when you think about God?"

30
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,860
 And there's a host, oh, that kind of question.

31
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,940
 And so he's like back and forth, you know,

32
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,260
 between us and other tables.

33
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,220
 And the second question,

34
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,820
 "Hey, what comes to mind when you think about the Bible?"

35
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,300
 And then he kind of goes back and forth.

36
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,660
 He's like, "Let me think on that."

37
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,560
 And the third question is,

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,420
 "What comes to mind when you think about the church?"

39
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,020
 And so then kind of all the other tables clear out

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,180
 and we're there 'cause we were meeting

41
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,020
 about some other things.

42
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,140
 And so we're able to talk with this young man.

43
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,180
 And I wrote down his questions.

44
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,020
 I'd love to share.

45
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,280
 I wrote down his answers.

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,180
 I'd love to share them with you.

47
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,820
 So what comes to your mind when you think about God?

48
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,340
 He said, "A higher power that no one can know."

49
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,700
 Maybe you know someone that would say the same thing.

50
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,900
 Maybe you know someone that would respond in a similar way.

51
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,260
 He says, "What comes to mind

52
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,300
 "when you think about the Bible?"

53
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,100
 And he said, "A book that's been changed over time."

54
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,980
 And he likened it to like the telephone game.

55
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,540
 Like when you whisper in someone's ear

56
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,660
 and then they tell the next person

57
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,660
 and they tell the next person

58
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,620
 and then it comes out different.

59
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,740
 And we got to have a great conversation about that.

60
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,400
 I said, "Hey, are you aware of the Dead Sea Scrolls,

61
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,400
 "the greatest archeological discovery ever to find,

62
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,240
 "ever to be found?

63
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,340
 "Did you understand that that dates,

64
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,560
 "pre-dates before they thought the Bible was changed,

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,900
 "that it shows that it hasn't been changed?

66
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,580
 "Do you know how many manuscripts we have?"

67
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,600
 And we started to have this really thoughtful

68
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,300
 and engaging conversation.

69
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,540
 And this is what comes to mind

70
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,140
 when you think about the church.

71
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,300
 And he said, "A group of people

72
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,220
 "who don't really believe what they say they believe."

73
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,040
 And I said, "Well, what do you mean by that?"

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
 And we're in this conversation.

75
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,880
 He said, "Well, you know,"

76
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,040
 he's essentially saying people that gather around hypocrisy

77
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,000
 because they say that Jesus is the life

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,900
 and the Bible is true and that life is found in God alone,

79
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,300
 but they really live their lives however they want.

80
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,920
 And I was particularly intrigued by this answer.

81
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,840
 And I asked him, I said, "Well, listen, what do you believe?"

82
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,780
 And he said this, he said,

83
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,020
 "I believe we need to find our own way

84
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,960
 "determine what is true for us

85
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,900
 "and live our lives the way we want to

86
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,900
 "as long as we do good."

87
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,880
 We're in this series, Bad Advice,

88
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,780
 and I wanna start by saying that's bad advice.

89
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,920
 That's bad advice that you need to find your own way to God,

90
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,440
 determine what is true for you

91
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,560
 and live your life however you want as long as you do good.

92
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,400
 That's not good advice.

93
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,480
 But this is very popular idea,

94
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,760
 particularly in our generation.

95
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,800
 This is an idea that's growing in popularity,

96
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,720
 and I'll show you some stats that 43% of millennials,

97
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,860
 if you were born between 1980 and 2000,

98
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,880
 said it doesn't matter what religious faith you follow

99
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,560
 because they all teach the same lessons.

100
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,240
 Some of you might think that here.

101
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,460
 70% of all major Christian

102
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,080
 and non-Christian religious groups say

103
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,000
 many religions can lead to eternal life.

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Comes from USA Today.

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,760
 The fastest growing religious expression

106
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,480
 among the millennials is called nuns,

107
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,640
 comprised of men and women who have no religious affiliation

108
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,200
 or are atheist agnostic.

109
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,320
 They might say, "I'm spiritual but not religious."

110
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,160
 You ever heard this?

111
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,980
 Anybody ever told you that?

112
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,880
 "Hey, I'm spiritual but not religious."

113
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,720
 Anybody ever heard that?

114
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
 Some of you here, you've said that.

115
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
 Spiritual, not religious.

116
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,720
 Pew Research Center said that this is twice as many,

117
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,900
 millennials believe this,

118
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,760
 than compared to our parents' generation,

119
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,780
 and three times more than compared

120
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,960
 to our grandparents' generation.

121
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,160
 Furthermore, when it comes to religious tolerance,

122
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,720
 millennials tend to think it doesn't matter what you believe.

123
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,060
 68% say there's more than one true way

124
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,000
 to interpret the teachings of my religion.

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,720
 50% believe all people are eventually saved

126
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,160
 or accepted by God no matter what they do.

127
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,320
 That is a teaching called universalism.

128
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,580
 That everyone ultimately goes to heaven,

129
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,300
 and here's the problem with those beliefs.

130
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,760
 They're not rooted in an ancient scripture,

131
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,120
 an ancient writing, a man who showed back up from the dead

132
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,320
 and say, "Here's the reality."

133
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,320
 They're not rooted in history, biology, and science.

134
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,840
 They're rooted in one thing, feelings.

135
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,040
 I don't wanna think people go to hell,

136
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,160
 so I kinda just made up my own religion

137
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,060
 that all people somehow get to heaven.

138
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,760
 That's interesting.

139
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,520
 What divine revelation did you have?

140
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,680
 What dream, what man showed back up from the grave

141
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,780
 and taught you?

142
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,960
 It's just a convenient truth.

143
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,880
 We think we're growing smarter than our parents

144
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,860
 and than our grandparents,

145
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,120
 but really, when it comes to God, we digress.

146
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,720
 If there's a God, and he's a creator God,

147
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,400
 and I literally believe this as fact.

148
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,580
 I believe he spoke things into existence,

149
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,140
 like he said it and it formed.

150
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,520
 That he's the creator of all things,

151
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,940
 that he thought about you before the creation of the world

152
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,600
 and had plans for your life.

153
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,260
 He knew the talents he was gonna entrust to you,

154
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,300
 and so if that is true of him,

155
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,260
 if he can speak things into existence,

156
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,140
 but he cannot introduce himself to me,

157
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,360
 then he's a weak God.

158
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,540
 And if he has to show himself as these different faces,

159
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,080
 like he's one God over here and a different God over here

160
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,620
 and a different God over here, that's just confusing.

161
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,000
 Like you would agree if I said, hey, I'm really strong

162
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,980
 and I'm really talented and I can do all things,

163
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,060
 but I can't even tell you who I am.

164
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,040
 That's problematic.

165
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,540
 And I don't think that's true about God.

166
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,280
 The problem is that so many of us say we know this God,

167
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,720
 but we live our lives however we want to,

168
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,240
 and our theology gets squishy,

169
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,520
 because we say that we believe the Bible is true

170
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,500
 and that it's God's written word, but we don't read it,

171
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,740
 we don't study it, we don't apply it to our lives.

172
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,660
 We say that life is found in Christ alone,

173
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,080
 but if anybody was to come and audit our life

174
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,980
 and to list out our priorities,

175
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,280
 they would begin to prioritize other things over Jesus.

176
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,280
 And our behavior always follows our belief.

177
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,940
 So what do we really believe?

178
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,920
 You have a choice.

179
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,300
 You can try to find your own way to God,

180
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,500
 determine your own truth, and live your own life,

181
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,280
 or you can turn to the one who gave you life

182
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,220
 and has a purpose for your life,

183
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,740
 and you can ask him the way.

184
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,680
 You can allow him to define the truth,

185
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,000
 and you can ask him, hey, how do you want me

186
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,320
 to live my life, and so that's what we're gonna look at,

187
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,920
 how Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.

188
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,200
 What does this mean?

189
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,880
 What does this say about Jesus?

190
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,200
 And so I'm gonna be in John chapter 14,

191
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,320
 but it actually starts in chapter 13

192
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,160
 as we continue this series, Bad Advice.

193
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,400
 And so Jesus is talking to his boys,

194
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,100
 and he says, listen, I'm going somewhere,

195
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,640
 and you cannot come with me.

196
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,160
 But where I'm going, see, he's about to die.

197
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,920
 He's telegraphing what's about to happen.

198
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,240
 He says, but where I'm going, you're gonna come later.

199
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,640
 And Peter, you know, he bows up,

200
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,920
 and he's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

201
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,160
 I'm gonna go anywhere with you, man,

202
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,920
 ride or die, it's you and me for life.

203
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,360
 We're gonna, I'm not leaving your side, Jesus.

204
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,260
 And Jesus tells him, really, man,

205
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,700
 before the rooster crows, you're gonna deny me three times.

206
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:03,260
 And so he says, listen, I'm gonna go, I gotta die.

207
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,720
 One of you is gonna betray me.

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,640
 Peter, you're gonna disown me.

209
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,560
 And Satan, he's gonna work against all of this.

210
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,440
 And so it's this really tender moment.

211
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,800
 These guys are pretty discouraged.

212
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,040
 You can imagine, they're sitting there,

213
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,220
 and they're just like, what?

214
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,160
 And he says this, John 14, one.

215
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,220
 Do not let your hearts be troubled, guys.

216
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,840
 Come here, hey, listen, don't let your hearts be troubled.

217
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,040
 You believe in God.

218
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,160
 Believe also in me.

219
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,960
 See, my father's house, it has many rooms.

220
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,880
 If that were not so, would I have told you

221
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,120
 that I am going there to prepare a place for you?

222
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,080
 And if I go to prepare a place for you,

223
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,220
 I will come back and take you to be with me,

224
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,760
 that you may also be where I am.

225
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,240
 Why does he use this language?

226
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,360
 This is an incredibly intimate language.

227
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,120
 This is the Hebrew wedding or Hebrew marriage metaphor.

228
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,440
 What would happen is a young Hebrew, young Jewish child

229
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,120
 would leave his father's home, go into a foreign land,

230
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,960
 find a bride, return back to his father's house,

231
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,960
 begin to build a room on his father's house,

232
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,160
 and then at a time and an hour unknown,

233
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,640
 return for his bride to take her home to that room.

234
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,760
 And that's the language Jesus is using here.

235
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,360
 He said, guys, don't you understand?

236
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,680
 I'm going to build a place for you,

237
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,340
 and if you weren't gonna live in it, I wouldn't build it,

238
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,300
 but I'm coming back for you.

239
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,280
 That's the hope you live with today, guys.

240
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,560
 I'm coming back for you.

241
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,160
 You know, he says, you know the place where I am going.

242
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,040
 And Thomas, this is doubting Thomas, or Thomas Didymus,

243
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,200
 Thomas the twin, he speaks up and he says,

244
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,640
 Lord, we don't know where you are going,

245
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,400
 so how can we know the way?

246
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:51,200
 And then Jesus, God incarnate, God in the flesh,

247
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,440
 creator God walking the earth, said, spoke these words.

248
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,440
 He said, I am the way and the truth and the life.

249
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,360
 We could have stopped at I am.

250
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,520
 Those two words.

251
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,920
 We could spend an entire evening on the two words I am,

252
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,160
 because this is God's name for himself.

253
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,360
 And they said, who are you in Exodus?

254
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,280
 He says, I am who I am.

255
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,960
 Remember Jesus in the garden when they come to arrest him,

256
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,660
 and they say, hey, are you the Christ?

257
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,820
 And he says, I am.

258
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,500
 And they fall over like a science fiction movie.

259
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,900
 They just, poof, fall on the ground.

260
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,240
 Powerful words.

261
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,920
 He says, I am.

262
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,720
 And it translates, I and only I am the way,

263
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,200
 the truth, and the life.

264
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,680
 And he says this, no one comes to the Father

265
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,740
 except through me.

266
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,440
 So what does it mean that Jesus is the way?

267
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,780
 The bad advice is that there are many ways to God.

268
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,100
 My first point is that Jesus is the only way

269
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,160
 to eternal life with God.

270
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,960
 Specifically, Jesus is answering,

271
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,600
 hey, how do we get to God?

272
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,920
 How do we get to where you're going?

273
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,600
 My wife, my family, and I, we're planning a vacation.

274
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,720
 Right now, as we speak, I was on orbits today

275
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,760
 looking at locations and flights.

276
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,040
 And what I do when I'm planning a vacation

277
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,760
 is I talk to somebody who's been there.

278
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,580
 Hey, you've been there?

279
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,960
 Hey, what did you do when you got there?

280
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,800
 Hey, how did you go?

281
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,080
 Did you fly, did you drive?

282
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,120
 What's the best thing?

283
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,180
 What's the best place to stay?

284
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,680
 Right, when you're going somewhere,

285
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,480
 you wanna talk to someone who's been there.

286
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,480
 Well, there's one person who's been

287
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,840
 in eternity past in heaven with the Father,

288
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,920
 came here and is back there, and he's coming back here.

289
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,120
 And this was the opportunity.

290
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,040
 Hey, so how do I get there?

291
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,660
 Hey, I'm how you get there.

292
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,280
 I'm the way.

293
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,040
 No one gets to the Father except through me.

294
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,560
 And so maybe you've been here and you've heard,

295
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,000
 well, basically, right, all religions teach the same thing.

296
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,560
 That was a part of our conversation at lunch.

297
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,460
 That was one of the things this young man said.

298
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,560
 He says all religions essentially teach the same thing.

299
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,560
 I mean, no offense to him, but I will tell you

300
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,120
 that it's an incredibly uneducated position

301
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,980
 that all religions basically teach the same thing.

302
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,680
 Let's just study them for a second.

303
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,180
 I don't expect you to leave here an expert

304
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,880
 on Islam or Hinduism, but I will just give you

305
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,420
 just a brief overview from some of these things.

306
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,720
 So this comes from Islam.

307
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
 This is the Quran.

308
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,720
 The Quran, for lack of better term, is the Islamic Bible.

309
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,400
 This comes from, let's see, the Ali Imran,

310
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,440
 chapter three, verse 85.

311
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,440
 "Whoever prefers a religion other than Islam,

312
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,200
 "it shall definitely not be accepted from him,

313
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,440
 "and in the hereafter, he shall be among the losers."

314
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,320
 And then from the Al-Ma'idah, chapter five, verse 72,

315
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,600
 listen to this one.

316
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,600
 "They have certainly disbelieved who say Allah

317
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,680
 "is the Messiah, the Son of Mary.

318
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,960
 "Allah has forbidden him paradise,

319
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,320
 "and his refuge is the fire."

320
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,560
 Let me summarize that for you

321
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,040
 in case you got lost in that language.

322
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,320
 It's saying anyone who believes Jesus is God

323
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,480
 is going to hell.

324
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,780
 That's from the Quran.

325
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,040
 So you got the Bible,

326
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,280
 Jesus, I am the way, the truth, and the life,

327
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,640
 no one is the father except through me,

328
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,640
 and the Quran, anyone who believes Jesus is God

329
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,080
 is going to hell.

330
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,240
 And they're both right.

331
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,040
 They're not, in case somebody clips that sound.

332
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,320
 [congregation laughing]

333
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
 Sends it viral.

334
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,400
 Let's talk Hinduism, okay?

335
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,000
 This is Krishna, the Hindu force of the universe speaking.

336
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,520
 This comes from the Hindu Bible, if you will,

337
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,200
 the Bhagavad Gita.

338
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
 This is chapter nine, verses three through four.

339
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,680
 It says, "Those who are without faith in my teaching

340
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,000
 "cannot attain Krishna or enlightenment.

341
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,400
 "I permeate all the universe in my unmanifest form.

342
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,240
 "All beings exist within me.

343
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,520
 "If you do not accept this view that you do not exist,

344
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,440
 "you will never achieve Hindu salvation."

345
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,320
 This is the one way to Hindu salvation.

346
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,680
 But it's also interesting that not just the path

347
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,220
 to eternal life is different, the destiny is different.

348
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,480
 The Hindus believe in reincarnation.

349
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,080
 And so you're not spending eternity with the father,

350
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,640
 you're being made again into,

351
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,120
 depending on how you live your life,

352
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,800
 what your karma was, a rat, a cow.

353
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,740
 And if that sounds disrespectful,

354
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,840
 that also is an uneducated position, 'cause it's not.

355
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,720
 They treat cows like gods.

356
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,560
 And so then there's Buddhism.

357
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,560
 From the Dhammapada, chapter 20, verses 274 through 275.

358
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,700
 Oddly enough, this section of this writings

359
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,080
 is called the way.

360
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,840
 Buddhism is the only path.

361
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,040
 There is none other for the purification of insight.

362
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,560
 Walking upon this path will make an end of suffering.

363
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,640
 It is the only way.

364
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,480
 Exclusive.

365
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,320
 And then in the Jewish tradition,

366
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,820
 exclusivity manifests itself in God's chosen people,

367
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,840
 in which anyone who accepts the teachings

368
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,840
 of Jewish monotheism is waiting for a messianic world

369
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,160
 to come, they've rejected Jesus as the Messiah,

370
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,540
 they are waiting for the Messiah to come,

371
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,600
 and that is the only way to get to God,

372
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,240
 is through the law.

373
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,640
 And so if you're here, and in the name of love and tolerance

374
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,400
 you wanna coexist and think, hey, all religions are correct,

375
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,000
 what you've done is maybe the most unloving, unhelpful,

376
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,640
 most hurtful thing you could possibly do.

377
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,760
 What you're really saying is they're all wrong,

378
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,000
 ignorant to what they actually teach,

379
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 with absolute contradictory statements

380
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,880
 within their spiritual writings,

381
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,040
 that they cannot be all right,

382
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,760
 to say that they are all correct

383
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,720
 is to say all of them are wrong.

384
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,440
 It is to reject all of it, it may sound good,

385
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,440
 feel cute and fuzzy, it just doesn't work out intellectually.

386
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,460
 So now you've got a choice, I can reject them all,

387
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,040
 I can embrace one of them, what do I do?

388
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,280
 The reality of it is, is we can coexist here, absolutely.

389
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,720
 I've got friends who are Muslim,

390
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,800
 I have friends who are Hindu,

391
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,720
 I can sit down and break bread

392
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,020
 and have conversation and discuss faith,

393
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,800
 we can coexist here, but we cannot coexist in eternity

394
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,500
 through embracing those beliefs.

395
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:32,060
 And it's harmful, it's unloving.

396
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,440
 And if you're here and you believe that,

397
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,120
 you have made up a religion

398
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,200
 and ultimately rejected six billion people.

399
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,200
 (audience laughing)

400
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,320
 Let me go one more with you.

401
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,920
 Monica and I, my wife and I,

402
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,960
 we were in New York and we were really far from our hotel

403
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,200
 and we had done this kind of hop on, hop off bus tour thing

404
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,280
 and we were really far and we had this idea

405
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,480
 like let's take the subway back,

406
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,420
 we'd never been on the subway,

407
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,900
 so let's experience the subway.

408
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,160
 And so we buy our ticket, we go underground

409
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,680
 and we're sitting there and, you know,

410
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,520
 should have thought this through,

411
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,760
 but there's this big map of all these lines

412
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,540
 and I'm trying to figure out the one to get to our hotel,

413
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,140
 but there's like a green line, a blue line, a red line,

414
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,600
 a black line, a yellow line,

415
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,680
 looks like some sort of gospel presentation or something

416
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,960
 and they're all there.

417
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,040
 And I'm just staring at it hopelessly

418
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,920
 and I'm like trying to follow

419
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,120
 and this local, this New Yorker comes up

420
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,280
 by the grace of God and says,

421
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,880
 hey man, can I help you out?

422
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,340
 And I'm like, yeah, man, we're trying to get to the Marriott

423
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,760
 over there, you know, near Times Square

424
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,720
 and he says, oh man, you need the green line.

425
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:56,680
 Now what I didn't say, dude, don't green line me, bro.

426
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,560
 Coming at me with all your closed mindedness on your line,

427
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,000
 I'll take it, what about the yellow,

428
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,360
 what if I wanna take the yellow line?

429
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,040
 What if I wanna get to the Marriott by the yellow line?

430
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
 How about the black line?

431
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
 What if I was gonna jump on the,

432
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,880
 you're gonna come at me and tell me

433
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,120
 that the only way there is the green line?

434
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,320
 No, I said, thank you.

435
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,840
 Thank you for sharing that truth.

436
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,940
 You've obviously been where I wanna go

437
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,400
 and you're telling me how to get there.

438
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,700
 That's really helpful.

439
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,180
 Now, imagine that that's what happened,

440
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,860
 let's step out of that hypothetical situation.

441
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,080
 Let's just say I was dying, I was bit by a snake,

442
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,960
 I needed an antivenom of sorts and I'm there

443
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,560
 and I need to get to the hospital

444
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,640
 and I say, hey, and I'm frantically,

445
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,440
 he sees that I'm frantic and life's not going well right now

446
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,560
 and I need to go to the hospital.

447
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,160
 Which one's gonna take me to the hospital

448
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,360
 and to comfort me, to make me feel better,

449
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,520
 he puts his arm around me and says,

450
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,840
 hey man, here's the good news,

451
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,000
 any of these will take you to the hospital.

452
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,040
 Man, are you serious?

453
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,080
 Yeah, oh dude, that's good news, thank you so much.

454
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,320
 I feel so loved right now and then I get on one

455
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,620
 and I end up further from the hospital and I die.

456
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,180
 I'm gonna realize that wasn't very loving.

457
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,980
 You think about how many of your friends

458
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,380
 are gonna get to the end of this race,

459
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,520
 dude, why didn't you tell me Jesus was the way?

460
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,460
 Why didn't you tell me?

461
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,700
 You mean God came here in the form of a man

462
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,340
 and he told us how to get to God

463
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,060
 and you kept that to yourself?

464
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,940
 Why didn't you tell me?

465
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,580
 I'll go one more with you,

466
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,960
 if there was another way to save people,

467
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,040
 see, I've got a son, Weston,

468
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:43,120
 and if basically he has to die for your sins

469
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,040
 or anything else, I'm gonna choose anything else.

470
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,640
 Like it seems like when Jesus is in the Garden of Gethsemane

471
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,600
 and he's like, Lord, let this cup pass from me,

472
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,240
 God would be like, yeah, okay, you got it, man,

473
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,480
 'cause there's some other ways.

474
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,580
 They can just be good.

475
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,640
 You know, yeah, yeah, no worries, no need to die.

476
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,400
 No need to watch my son be publicly humiliated,

477
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,340
 pinned to two pieces of wood in the town square,

478
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:11,420
 asphyxiating slowly for the sins of man.

479
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,540
 There's other ways.

480
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,420
 Seems like that's when they would have been introduced.

481
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,460
 And so I know Christianity is exclusive, it is indeed,

482
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,280
 but I will tell you it is the most inclusive

483
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,860
 of all exclusive religions

484
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,200
 because Jesus is standing there at the gate saying,

485
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
 hey, come one, come all, I died for you.

486
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,160
 Just embrace my payment.

487
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,100
 Embrace what I've done for your sins

488
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,140
 and you can have my kingdom.

489
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,120
 Bad advice number two is to find out what is true for you.

490
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,680
 Truth is relative, truth is different for every person.

491
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,740
 Second point is Jesus is the truth

492
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,140
 that defines reality in the world he made.

493
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,020
 Jesus is the truth that defines reality

494
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,860
 in the world he made.

495
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,940
 This is different than saying Jesus is true.

496
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,900
 We can believe that Jesus is true.

497
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,700
 Most credible atheists in our day

498
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,700
 would embrace the existence and historicity of Jesus Christ.

499
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,140
 I'm not saying that Jesus is true,

500
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,240
 I'm saying Jesus is truth.

501
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,940
 But let's just go down that path for a second.

502
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,100
 Jesus is true historically, right?

503
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,580
 He fits in history.

504
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,980
 He was born in Bethlehem.

505
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,060
 Everyone here, you heard of Bethlehem?

506
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,460
 Raise your hand if you've heard of Bethlehem,

507
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,300
 if you're listening,

508
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,420
 raise your hand if you've heard of Bethlehem.

509
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,500
 Okay, it looks like just about everyone's heard of Bethlehem.

510
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,020
 Ever heard of Ephrat?

511
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,060
 How many of you have heard of Ephrat?

512
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,400
 It's a city right beside Bethlehem.

513
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,240
 You've never heard of it because Jesus wasn't born there.

514
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,100
 The only reason you know about Bethlehem

515
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,740
 is because Jesus was born there.

516
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,020
 If Jesus was born in Ephrat, I would say,

517
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,860
 "Who knows Ephrat?"

518
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,820
 Everybody would have raised their hand.

519
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,860
 Who knows Bethlehem?

520
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,100
 No one would have raised their hand.

521
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,940
 Bethlehu?

522
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,760
 We wouldn't know it.

523
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,100
 We know it because Jesus was born there.

524
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,600
 You know of Nazareth, right?

525
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,540
 Jesus lived in Nazareth,

526
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,100
 so we can all raise our hands we know of Nazareth.

527
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,860
 Anyone know Enmah Hill?

528
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,660
 It's a town right beside Nazareth.

529
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,860
 You've never heard of it.

530
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,940
 See, the only reason we know these places

531
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,740
 is because the single most polarizing character

532
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,640
 in the history of history lived there.

533
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,840
 That no matter where you go,

534
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,400
 people know the name of Jesus Christ.

535
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,840
 I've been in the jungles of Africa.

536
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,680
 They know him.

537
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,120
 I've gone down the rivers in the Amazon.

538
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,320
 Six days, got off to find a people

539
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,640
 who knew about Jesus Christ.

540
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,320
 Not just that, but your iPhone today

541
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,660
 tells you that it's 2017.

542
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:53,180
 2017 years from what?

543
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,440
 The birth of this man.

544
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,240
 See, up until he showed up, we were counting backwards.

545
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,560
 Before Christ, he shows up on the scene

546
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,120
 and we start counting one, two, three,

547
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,080
 all the way up to 2017.

548
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,100
 Every atheist you know acknowledges him

549
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,900
 by the date they put on their test paper or their checks.

550
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,640
 Truth, that's Jesus is true.

551
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,840
 Truth goes beyond simply being true.

552
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,240
 Truth defines the way things are, right?

553
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,000
 When something is truth, it can be rejected,

554
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,620
 but it is still true.

555
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,240
 And so there's people who say,

556
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,240
 well, there is no absolute truth.

557
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,200
 Well, then that's not absolute truth.

558
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,560
 Do you see, I just want you to engage your mind.

559
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,800
 That's all I'm trying to get you to do right now.

560
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,280
 I just want you to be thoughtful.

561
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,080
 If someone says, well, there's no absolute truth,

562
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,840
 they've just made an absolute statement.

563
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,160
 If there's no absolute truth,

564
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,860
 then you could reject their statement

565
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,960
 of there not being any absolute truth.

566
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,800
 That's crazy.

567
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,400
 Okay, listen, to hammer this home, right,

568
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,180
 that just because you say something

569
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,800
 and even because you believe something

570
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,040
 does not mean it's true, even if you know it to be true.

571
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,680
 I wanna do something and I need your participation with me.

572
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,180
 If wherever you're at, please participate with me.

573
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,280
 What I'd love for you to do right now is close your eyes.

574
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,760
 Okay, close your eyes, hold your purse close to you.

575
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,880
 I'm gonna watch everyone.

576
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,200
 I'm watching people's movement.

577
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
 Okay, if you would just close your eyes for a minute,

578
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,560
 okay, close your eyes and grab a good pointer finger.

579
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,060
 So hold up a pointer finger

580
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,080
 like you're doing the number one, right?

581
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,720
 So wherever you're at, Fort Worth, wherever,

582
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,620
 hold up a pointer finger and I want you to point

583
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,200
 on the count of three due north.

584
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,280
 One, two, three.

585
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,840
 Okay, now open your eyes.

586
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,780
 Nice.

587
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,620
 Nice.

588
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,140
 Hey, hey, back with me.

589
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,420
 Now you're arguing, okay?

590
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,940
 It's not worth arguing over.

591
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:03,620
 I'd love to, after the service today, after the service,

592
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,220
 for those of you that pointed straight up,

593
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,580
 I'd like to see you, okay?

594
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,080
 That's confusing.

595
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,060
 We're gonna, yeah.

596
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:19,700
 Here's the deal, north is that way.

597
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,460
 (congregation applauding)

598
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,940
 Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

599
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,420
 'Cause about a fourth of you think you got it right,

600
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,180
 but north is a really fine line.

601
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,940
 And if you travel it, you'll eventually hit Canada,

602
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,620
 but if you miss by one or two degrees,

603
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,080
 you can miss Canada altogether.

604
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,940
 It's a very narrow line.

605
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,220
 And some of you, you pointed confidently this way.

606
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,580
 You're like, no, I got this one.

607
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,020
 And you weren't any more right,

608
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,320
 no matter how much you believed it to be true.

609
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,220
 You weren't right.

610
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,700
 And for those of you that pointed this way or this way,

611
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,360
 right, you're close, but it wasn't due north.

612
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,740
 It wasn't the way.

613
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,580
 It's not Jesus plus something else.

614
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,920
 Jesus and other things.

615
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,300
 The gospel and works.

616
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,340
 It's Christ, he's the way.

617
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,020
 He's all you got.

618
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,060
 If you wanna get to God, you look to Jesus.

619
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:24,060
 He is the path, but he's not just the way.

620
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,880
 He's the truth.

621
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,620
 And so,

622
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:35,060
 you can reject truth in a number of different ways, right?

623
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,540
 I can reject the truth of gravity

624
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:41,180
 by jumping off a building, believing that I can fly.

625
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,220
 But the truth of gravity is going to prevail.

626
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,380
 And if we reject the truth of Jesus,

627
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,060
 we miss more than heaven.

628
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,140
 We miss out life here on earth.

629
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,800
 And the reason why we do, and this is so important,

630
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,460
 is because you were not just created by Jesus.

631
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,280
 You were created for Jesus.

632
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,060
 This is what Colossians 1 tells us.

633
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,620
 For in him all things were created,

634
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,980
 things in heaven and on earth,

635
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,280
 visible and invisible,

636
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,820
 whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities.

637
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:14,260
 All things have been created through him and for him.

638
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,740
 Here's what that means.

639
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,280
 Your atheist friend who hates Jesus

640
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,680
 was made by Jesus for Jesus.

641
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,420
 They were made for him.

642
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,740
 And so what happens is we get to this place

643
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,140
 where we think that us determining our own truth is freeing

644
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,460
 and it's not freeing.

645
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,180
 It actually robs us of freedom, right?

646
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,640
 We can choose to be free to do things

647
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,340
 that doesn't give us freedom.

648
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,940
 Like I can be free to choose not to eat

649
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,420
 'cause I want the freedom not to eat.

650
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,100
 I will eventually starve to death.

651
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,140
 You can have the freedom to reject Jesus

652
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,780
 and you will eventually spiritually starve to death,

653
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,380
 eternally death.

654
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:59,480
 There are truths that are wrapped up in this world

655
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,180
 that we must know.

656
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,700
 If we do not know Jesus, our soul will starve.

657
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:11,080
 My little girl was convinced that she could fly.

658
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,620
 She was convinced of it.

659
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,220
 And she spent an entire day building this flight suit.

660
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,140
 It was rather impressive, out of cardboard.

661
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,380
 And the time came to step out in the backyard

662
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,260
 and she gave herself as much runway.

663
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,020
 This was on Instagram, eternally memorialized.

664
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:32,300
 And she ran as fast as she could toward the fence.

665
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,460
 And I mean, she was convinced.

666
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,420
 And I'm thinking, I wonder what she's gonna do

667
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,460
 about the power lines right there.

668
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,940
 If she's even thinking that far ahead.

669
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,220
 But she just ran.

670
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,140
 And I mean, I had to intervene at some point

671
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,940
 to let her know there was a greater truth

672
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,500
 than what she believed with all her heart.

673
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,460
 And friends, listen, you are believing some things

674
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,780
 out of convenience and out of feelings

675
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,880
 that are not grounded in truth.

676
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,100
 And I just want you to think.

677
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,020
 I just want you to reconsider what is real.

678
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,780
 The world, your peers, your friends,

679
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,540
 it says freedom comes from you determining what is true.

680
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,660
 But this is different than what Jesus said.

681
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,340
 Jesus said, find out what is actually true

682
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,100
 and then you will be free.

683
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,140
 John 8, 32, then you will know the truth

684
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,780
 and the truth will set you free.

685
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,740
 Let me go one more illustration with you.

686
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,700
 Try to explain what I mean by this.

687
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,940
 My kids love pets.

688
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,140
 They have, since they could speak,

689
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,900
 they've wanted a pet, they love animals,

690
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,900
 they've wanted a pet.

691
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,420
 And man, they're conspiring against me.

692
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,660
 Like they meet in the rooms to talk about it

693
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,580
 and try to figure out how they're gonna get dad on board.

694
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,260
 And whenever we get near Petco,

695
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,860
 like they make me go inside

696
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,220
 'cause sometimes they have kittens and puppies in there

697
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,900
 and it's all a big setup.

698
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,740
 They teach 'em how to sit there and look sad.

699
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,580
 You know they do.

700
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,580
 And so we went in the other day, this happened again.

701
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:13,260
 We go in and the girls are looking at the cats

702
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,580
 and Weston's looking at the dog

703
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,340
 and I'm like, okay, sooner or later

704
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,380
 I'm gonna lose this battle.

705
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,180
 And so here's the compromise.

706
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,620
 I grab 'em, I say, hey guys, let me show you.

707
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,740
 So here's a pet I think you might

708
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,100
 actually be able to get one day.

709
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,100
 And I take 'em to the Betta fish.

710
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,620
 (congregation laughing)

711
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,540
 I'm like, look how beautiful this specimen is.

712
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,580
 I mean, it's purple, it's your favorite color.

713
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,060
 Look at 'em, I mean, that's great.

714
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,900
 And one of 'em, the younger one, says,

715
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,740
 oh, that's fantastic.

716
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,660
 I could take 'em out and play with 'em.

717
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,380
 (congregation laughing)

718
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,940
 And I'm trying to explain, no, you can't.

719
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,220
 Like the fish has to be in water.

720
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,360
 He's like, no, no, no, that's too confining.

721
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,580
 He didn't say that word.

722
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,260
 But he's like, it's not, he said, it's not fair, daddy.

723
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,900
 It's not fair.

724
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,820
 We'll get 'em out, we'll bust 'em outta here.

725
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,340
 We'll put 'em in our pocket and help 'em escape.

726
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,140
 (congregation laughing)

727
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,300
 For him to exist, he has to be in right relationship

728
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,180
 with that which he was existed for.

729
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:15,340
 And that's what I'm trying to tell you,

730
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,760
 is you are made by Jesus for Jesus.

731
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,860
 The truth that you live in

732
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,520
 is that you have to remain connected to that vine.

733
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,140
 Or you are dying.

734
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:32,140
 You're experiencing a spiritual death.

735
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,380
 And if you have not connected yourself to that vine

736
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,860
 or trusting in his death and resurrection

737
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,020
 for the forgiveness of your sins,

738
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,060
 you will face an eternal death.

739
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,780
 God made the world and placed us inside a narrative.

740
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,800
 Genesis to Revelation, that narrative is about Jesus.

741
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,800
 The whole book.

742
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,060
 One central character.

743
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,520
 And he's coming back for us.

744
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:02,020
 C.S. Lewis said, "I believe in Jesus

745
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,600
 "like I believe in the sun.

746
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,400
 "Not that I know it's there, but by it I see all things.

747
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,040
 "Not just that I see the sun,

748
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,900
 "but by the sun I see all things."

749
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,320
 The last bad advice is don't let anyone tell you

750
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,280
 how to live your life.

751
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,180
 You do you.

752
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,840
 My third and final point is life as it is intended

753
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,260
 cannot exist apart from Jesus.

754
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,840
 Life as it is intended cannot exist apart from Jesus.

755
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
 Jesus made life.

756
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,160
 He certainly knows best how it is lived.

757
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,560
 He lived it as an example.

758
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,240
 He changed my life, by the way.

759
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,240
 I lived in the world.

760
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,500
 I pursued the things of the world.

761
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,640
 Jesus came in.

762
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,440
 I lived John 10, 10, where he says,

763
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,120
 "I've come so that they may have life

764
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,400
 "and have it to the fullest,

765
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,060
 "that they would experience life abundantly."

766
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,060
 And as Jesus calls us to him, he calls us from sin.

767
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,980
 That's repentance, that we would turn from our sin

768
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,820
 and towards Jesus.

769
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,360
 And sin is not just this bad idea.

770
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,920
 It literally, very literally brings death into our life.

771
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,920
 And this is why the idea of tolerance towards sin

772
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,260
 is so unbelievably unloving.

773
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:16,920
 And this is so popular in our generation,

774
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,560
 that we just wanna let everybody to each his own,

775
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,800
 do their own thing, you do you, and not intervene,

776
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,000
 and we call it loving.

777
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,480
 It's not loving.

778
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,100
 I don't know how to wake you up and show you

779
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,700
 that it is extremely unloving.

780
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,420
 It's this opposing message.

781
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,140
 You see, our very best strategy is to call believers

782
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,420
 and non-believers alike to the truth,

783
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,720
 into a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ.

784
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,620
 But there's this opposing message that is found

785
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,700
 that opposes Jesus in 2017 called new tolerance.

786
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,860
 Old tolerance, I have no problem with.

787
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,460
 Old tolerance, it says this, I wrote it down.

788
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,740
 Old tolerance said that we should accept

789
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,540
 that there are different views.

790
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,580
 Man, I've got no problem sitting beside you

791
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,780
 and acknowledging you believe something different

792
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,300
 than what I believe, be it about marriage,

793
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,460
 be it about sexuality, be it about what freedoms you have,

794
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:14,260
 be it about who you voted for, I don't care what it is.

795
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,420
 I've got no problem sitting with you

796
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,420
 and disagreeing with you politely,

797
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,660
 just saying, man, hey, I respect your opinion,

798
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,460
 I have a different opinion, we can still be friends,

799
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,700
 I still love you, you need a kidney, I got two,

800
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,340
 you know, it's all, right, that's fine.

801
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,780
 New tolerance says this,

802
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,040
 says that we should accept different views.

803
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,980
 That's different.

804
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,980
 That's where when I bump up against someone

805
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,320
 who disagrees with me, that what I need to do

806
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,580
 to love them appropriately is embrace their views as my own

807
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,980
 and to say I believe that too, that's ludicrous.

808
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,180
 How did we get there?

809
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,860
 That's crazy.

810
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,180
 Old tolerance, hey, it's okay for people to disagree.

811
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,220
 New tolerance, the only thing you cannot do is disagree.

812
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,060
 That when you disagree, it's hateful.

813
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,340
 What you must do is be open to everybody's views

814
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,520
 so that no one really has views and we accessorize our lives

815
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,860
 with different things that different people believe.

816
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,860
 It's like you hear something that someone believes

817
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,220
 and you're like, oh, that kind of sounds like a good idea,

818
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,420
 and you wear it like a hat for a season

819
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,140
 until you find something else,

820
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,980
 you're like, well, that's kind of good too,

821
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,480
 and you put it on like a coat.

822
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,980
 Instead of actually sitting down

823
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,300
 and doing the contemplative work it takes to say

824
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,940
 with the scriptures, who is God?

825
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,580
 What does he say is true?

826
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,740
 What do I actually believe?

827
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:40,100
 How am I going to live my life because of that?

828
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:49,260
 And what's gonna happen is that people

829
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:55,540
 will call for tolerance and that when someone faces

830
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,340
 the natural consequences of sin,

831
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,420
 they're going to blame it on intolerance.

832
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,060
 I just read an article about this.

833
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,340
 It was about suicide rates

834
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,660
 and those who are addicted to pornography.

835
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,860
 And it said that people who were addicted to pornography

836
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,020
 had a higher depression and suicide rate,

837
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,220
 and then it said the reason that they thought that they did

838
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,560
 was because of the intolerant culture around it.

839
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,620
 And because they didn't feel accepted or embraced

840
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,620
 by their addiction to pornography,

841
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,300
 they became depressed and therefore suicidal.

842
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,820
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

843
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,980
 God, the creator of the heavens and the earth told us

844
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,540
 that when we do those things, we experience death.

845
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,060
 It's not the intolerance that's the problem.

846
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,960
 It's the given into sin that's the problem.

847
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,820
 And so it doesn't take tolerance to love that person.

848
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,260
 It takes truth.

849
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,900
 Don't you see it takes truth?

850
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,180
 Say, hey, let me show you a better way.

851
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,120
 And so I know that a lot of folks here,

852
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,300
 you're not Muslim or another world religion,

853
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,580
 but you're just as wrong.

854
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,700
 Because you say you believe in Jesus,

855
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,700
 but you live your life however you want.

856
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,840
 And you're doing more harm to Christianity than good.

857
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:15,640
 And you would be better off shaking the Christian label.

858
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:21,140
 You would be better off to stop calling yourself a Christian

859
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,940
 or to really be better off to listen and say,

860
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,760
 God, are you real?

861
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,000
 And I wanna give my life to you if you are.

862
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,960
 When we understand that Jesus is the way,

863
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,560
 the truth, and the life, it changes the way we preach.

864
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,780
 It changes the way that we share,

865
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,080
 just like David's great message last week

866
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,320
 when we share the gospel.

867
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,120
 I wanna show you an example of Peter and John

868
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,960
 who had just healed a man, and they're facing death,

869
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,140
 and all they need to do is deny the resurrection

870
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,920
 of Jesus Christ so that they can live

871
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,880
 or escape being incarcerated.

872
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,900
 And they're in front of the Sadducees

873
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,220
 who deny the resurrection, and this is what they say.

874
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,700
 If there was another way to God,

875
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,040
 this would be a great time to say it,

876
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,180
 but this is what they say.

877
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,500
 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them,

878
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,380
 rulers and elders of the people,

879
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,180
 if we are being called to account today

880
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,300
 for an act of kindness shown to a man who was slain

881
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,720
 and are being asked how he was healed,

882
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,120
 then know this, you and all the people of Israel,

883
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,980
 it is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,

884
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,160
 whom you crucified, but whom God raised from the dead,

885
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,280
 that this man stands before you healed.

886
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,800
 Jesus is the stone you builders rejected,

887
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,560
 which has become the cornerstone.

888
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,800
 Salvation is found in no one else,

889
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,160
 for there is no other name under heaven

890
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,700
 given to mankind by which we must be saved.

891
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,280
 And that would have been a great time to say,

892
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,140
 hey, Sadducees, listen, man, listen, just be good,

893
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,280
 and let us go, and let us live.

894
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,020
 Just live your lives, man, lots of ways that God,

895
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,700
 that'd be a good time to do that.

896
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,760
 That's not what they said.

897
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,360
 In summary, if a creator exists,

898
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,960
 do you believe that he could show us the way to him?

899
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,800
 Do you believe there is absolute truth in how we find it?

900
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,660
 If God created us, do you think he would tell us

901
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,180
 where life can be found?

902
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,480
 And Jesus, who had spent eternity past with the Father,

903
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,940
 said, no one comes to the Father except through me.

904
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:29,060
 To go back to that lunch conversation with a server,

905
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,460
 I said, hey, let me ask you a question.

906
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,640
 Do you have a faith?

907
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,140
 He said, no.

908
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:42,980
 I said, are you an atheist or agnostic?

909
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,740
 He said, yeah, I mean, I guess I'm atheist.

910
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:50,680
 I said, okay, who do you study, like,

911
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,760
 in regards to atheism, do you read Hitchens,

912
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,340
 or Dawkins, or Sam Harris, like, who are you a student of?

913
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:01,360
 He said something really profound I wanna share with you.

914
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:07,140
 He said, I grew up in the dead church.

915
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,660
 That was education enough.

916
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,940
 I want you to think about that for a moment.

917
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,260
 He said, I've lived my life long enough

918
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,600
 to know that there are Christians

919
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,940
 who say they believe one thing,

920
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,080
 but live a very different way.

921
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,680
 And I'm just gonna go ahead and just claim

922
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,760
 that I'm an atheist because they're functional atheists.

923
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,660
 It doesn't mean that they actually believe there's a God

924
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,380
 because they say they believe there's a God.

925
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,860
 Our behavior always follows our belief.

926
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,400
 We can say Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life,

927
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,880
 and then we can follow a different way,

928
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,120
 search for a different truth,

929
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,200
 and find life on our own in other things.

930
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,580
 You've got a lot of options.

931
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,800
 If you wanna know where life is found,

932
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,100
 like, you could talk to your buddies.

933
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,360
 Hey, what do y'all believe?

934
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,560
 You know, you can go to your friends, your parents.

935
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,300
 You can talk to your crazy uncle.

936
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,440
 Hey, man, like, where is life really found?

937
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,400
 You know, can you help me out?

938
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,220
 What's true, and how do I find out what's true?

939
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:14,120
 Or you can go to the one who showed up on the scene

940
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,100
 and made quite the big splash.

941
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,520
 He lived a perfect life.

942
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,500
 I mean, people couldn't bring anything against him.

943
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,600
 In fact, everywhere he went,

944
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,400
 people were getting healed left and right.

945
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,280
 It's documented really, really well in history.

946
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:32,840
 Such a perfect life that those who were religious

947
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,300
 at the time became incredibly jealous of him

948
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,540
 because he claimed to be God.

949
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,820
 And so they tortured him and killed him

950
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,500
 in the most humiliating kind of way,

951
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,400
 as had been prophesied for hundreds of years.

952
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,680
 In fact, hundreds of years, 400 years

953
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,260
 before Jesus shows up on the scene,

954
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,380
 it says that he's going to die on a cross

955
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,320
 before anyone had ever seen a cross

956
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,820
 or even knew what one was.

957
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,560
 He does so.

958
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,960
 And as the prophets had foretold,

959
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,700
 he showed back up from the dead.

960
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,920
 And it says in historical documents

961
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,240
 that over 500 people saw him.

962
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,560
 If you're wondering how Jesus became so famous,

963
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,600
 500 people saw a dead man walking.

964
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,220
 That's something you talk about.

965
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:30,460
 And these 11 guys who were complete and total cowards

966
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:33,080
 now are standing in front of the Sadducees

967
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,740
 and the Sanhedrin and religious people in the world

968
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,920
 saying, "Hey, I'll give my life.

969
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,420
 "I saw that man come back to life.

970
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,580
 "You do whatever you want to with me.

971
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,620
 "You want to cut off my head?

972
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,620
 "You want to hit me with a club?

973
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,940
 "You want to throw me off that building?

974
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,740
 "You want to crucify me upside down?

975
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,760
 "Do what you gotta do."

976
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,840
 But I saw him come back to life.

977
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,840
 I saw him resurrect.

978
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,440
 I saw him ascend into the sky,

979
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,840
 seated at the right hand of God, the creator.

980
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,960
 What you gonna do to me?

981
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,760
 He came back from the grave.

982
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,360
 What you gonna do to me?

983
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:09,120
 Better question, what are you gonna do with your life?

984
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:13,080
 What's true?

985
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,080
 How do you get to God?

986
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,640
 Have you thought about it?

987
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:27,800
 Father, help us think about it.

988
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,300
 (congregation murmuring)

989
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:39,280
 When we're searching for the way to you,

990
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,720
 we can listen to somebody else

991
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,080
 or we can listen to your son who you sent here.

992
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,120
 When we're searching for what is true,

993
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,280
 we can look at bumper stickers

994
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,220
 or we can listen to your son who you sent here.

995
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:55,760
 When we're searching for how to live our life,

996
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,160
 we can read some self-help books, God.

997
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,040
 Or we can turn to you who gave us life,

998
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,100
 the author and the perfecter of our faith.

999
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,860
 We can ask you what to do.

1000
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,860
 Father, would you guide and lead us?

1001
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:13,840
 Would you direct our steps?

1002
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,760
 If there's somebody here that hasn't come

1003
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,760
 into a relationship with you,

1004
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,240
 anyone listening who hasn't come

1005
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,860
 into a relationship with you, Lord,

1006
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,900
 by the power of your Holy Spirit, please, God,

1007
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,140
 would you woo them into a relationship with you?

1008
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,280
 Help them to deal with these truths,

1009
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,200
 not to listen to bad advice, but to stand on the truth.

1010
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:37,240
 Your son, Jesus Christ, is the way, the only way,

1011
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:42,480
 the truth, the only truth, and the life as it is intended.

1012
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,040
 In his name, amen.
