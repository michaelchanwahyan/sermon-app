1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:28,440
 - Alright, what's up guys?

3
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,160
 Welcome, everybody joining us online and live

4
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,240
 in all the other Porch locations.

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,460
 That's right, if you didn't just hear,

6
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,300
 we are live streaming from Houston, Texas,

7
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,840
 which is a first for us and Porch Houston.

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,400
 Good to be back, man.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,720
 How fun.

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,600
 People, together, my extra extrovertedness, man.

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,440
 It's missing people, so it is fun

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,160
 to get to be down here with you guys.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,800
 We are continuing a series called Therapy.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,040
 This your first week with us?

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,000
 You can check out the Porch app

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,480
 and you can find all the different messages

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,000
 that we've covered so far as we've gone through

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,960
 four different therapy sessions, if you will.

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,520
 If ever our nation, or ever there was a time

20
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,460
 where people needed to go to therapy,

21
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,060
 we is there because we have all been experiencing

22
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,200
 a lot of turbulence in life.

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,960
 And things were already bad before that.

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,720
 Anxiety was at record highs.

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,440
 Our generation, or the generation of young adults

26
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,680
 out right now, has higher levels of anxiety

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,420
 than any other group of people in the country.

28
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,280
 In fact, studies have shown that a psychiatric ward patient

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,280
 in the 1950s has the same amount,

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,080
 or had the same amount of stress and anxiety

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,320
 as the average young adult today.

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,240
 People are anxious, and we were anxious before COVID.

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,760
 Mental health has been a huge issue,

34
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,620
 and as we've talked about, if you've been with us,

35
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,100
 it's not always an issue that the church covers a lot of.

36
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,240
 So we're not done with this series,

37
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,240
 and we're just continuing it tonight.

38
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,480
 But we're gonna launch into, I think,

39
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,480
 a tremendously crucial topic, especially for this season.

40
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,660
 It's fun to be back in Houston.

41
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,840
 I'm from Houston originally.

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,660
 I'm an Astros fan 'til I die,

43
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,020
 even though they did what they did.

44
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,920
 And I'm a little bit sick, but it is not COVID.

45
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,100
 I've had two tests.

46
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,100
 It is not positive.

47
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,180
 I'm the only person in America

48
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,300
 with a bacterial sinus infection right now, apparently.

49
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,100
 But let me start with this

50
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,900
 to frame up where we're going for tonight.

51
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,500
 When I was in college, I had a buddy of mine

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,500
 who spent some time, one, he did what you do

53
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,540
 when you're in college, and you have a free day.

54
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,100
 He just decided, I'm gonna go out to this lake

55
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,660
 that was nearby the campus that we went.

56
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,700
 Anyone, any Aggies in the room in here?

57
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,540
 (audience cheering)

58
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,260
 Yeah, so Lake Brian, he goes out.

59
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,260
 He's gonna go hang, read books, do it, you know,

60
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,140
 you do when you're in college.

61
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,500
 And he goes out, spends a day reading,

62
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,860
 chilling in a hammock, just kinda having the day out there.

63
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,260
 And at some point, he realizes

64
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,780
 he needed to go to the bathroom.

65
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,380
 And there weren't any bathrooms around,

66
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,180
 and he didn't need to go,

67
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,020
 man, this is going somewhere too, by the way.

68
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,940
 He had to go, not number one, but number two of the bathroom.

69
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,060
 So he does with guys, ladies, you should know this,

70
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,900
 will do in that situation, go to the woods,

71
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,540
 take care of business, use some leaves,

72
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,980
 everything's fine, it's all great.

73
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,100
 He does so, goes back, reads his book,

74
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,060
 it's a great afternoon, jumps in the water,

75
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,460
 it's all good and fine.

76
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,660
 Goes back home that night, falls asleep.

77
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,780
 In the middle of the night, he wakes up,

78
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,260
 and he is covered in a poison ivy rash

79
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,300
 in a very unfortunate location.

80
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,340
 It was like he was in a poison oak, not poison ivy,

81
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,620
 which is pretty much the same thing.

82
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,580
 Poison oak diaper rash was consuming his body.

83
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,820
 And this was basically a roommate of mine,

84
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,580
 and got to see all the experience

85
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,460
 that that was for the next month.

86
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,620
 But here's what began to happen.

87
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,580
 If you don't know this about poison ivy or poison oak,

88
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,940
 in order for a rash to heal, it has to be out in the light.

89
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,860
 That's a very difficult place

90
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,940
 to consistently get exposed to the light.

91
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,860
 And so for the next month, he did the same thing.

92
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,420
 He'd go to class, he'd sit in his chair,

93
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,300
 kind of squirm in tremendous pain,

94
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,740
 and then he'd go back home, and he would take an oatmeal bath.

95
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,940
 I don't know why you take oatmeal baths,

96
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,980
 but apparently oatmeal's not just for breakfast anymore,

97
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,020
 it works through poison oak.

98
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,980
 But this is what he would do,

99
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,740
 because he had to get it exposed to the light.

100
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,220
 And the longer, or because it was difficult

101
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,220
 to bring out into the light,

102
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,820
 it delayed healing of it taking place.

103
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,420
 So it was there for weeks, I repeat, weeks.

104
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,740
 And I learned, just through that incidence,

105
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,740
 a important principle as it relates to poison oak

106
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,700
 that translates into the scripture

107
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,940
 we're gonna look at tonight, teaches

108
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,700
 that the longer something is kept in the dark,

109
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,580
 it delays it from healing.

110
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,540
 And the same is true in you and I's life.

111
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,500
 The longer that we keep things in hiding,

112
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,620
 we keep things in the dark,

113
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,020
 we don't bring other people in

114
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,780
 and open up about where we are struggling,

115
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,700
 we delay experiencing healing in our lives.

116
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,340
 As I said, this is a really important topic,

117
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,020
 because as a pastor, and it probably goes without saying,

118
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,700
 all of us have seen it, there has been spikes

119
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,500
 in all types of, alcohol is through the roof sales,

120
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,900
 prescription drug addiction is through the roof,

121
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,580
 sexual sin and pornography is through the roof.

122
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,700
 And we all came in here and everybody looks pretty

123
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,060
 and they look like, you know,

124
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,700
 somebody that would be fun to go,

125
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,780
 we're hanging out together,

126
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,780
 but all of us came in with stuff in our life

127
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,860
 that if we are not intentional to bring into the light,

128
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,020
 we will not experience healing.

129
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,820
 And it's a problem that's not going away,

130
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,980
 it's only gonna get worse

131
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,380
 and it brings with it certain things.

132
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,020
 So tonight, we're gonna look at four ideas

133
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,220
 as it relates to healing.

134
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,020
 As I've said, this series is about therapy.

135
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,100
 My wife is a counselor and one of the things

136
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,780
 that if you go see any different counselor,

137
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,660
 they will suggest is you have to bring things forward,

138
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,940
 you have to be in relationship with other people

139
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,580
 where you can share what's actually going on,

140
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,220
 if not, it's a recipe for anxiety,

141
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,540
 it's a recipe for depression

142
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,660
 and it is a recipe that ends in addiction.

143
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,620
 And so now we're gonna look at one of the principles

144
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,980
 behind why that is and cover four different ideas.

145
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,780
 I'm gonna write or I'm just gonna give you the first one

146
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,540
 and I'll show you the scripture it comes from.

147
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,940
 But you may not know this, but shame brings anxiety.

148
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,260
 If you're carrying shame from an eating disorder in here,

149
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,140
 if you're carrying shame from a same sex attraction

150
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,620
 you've never told anybody about,

151
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,060
 an abortion that's a part of your past

152
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,340
 you've never told anybody about,

153
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,740
 or at least nobody recently.

154
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,660
 From sexual sin in your own life or from anything,

155
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,300
 it will bring with it anxiety every time.

156
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,140
 Here's how we know this,

157
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,860
 this comes straight out of Genesis chapter two

158
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,260
 and chapter three where basically,

159
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,460
 if you're not familiar with Genesis,

160
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,500
 it's a story of kind of where did everything originate from?

161
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,380
 God creates the world, everything's perfect.

162
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,700
 Adam and Eve are the only two people on the planet,

163
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,200
 they're the crown of God's creation.

164
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,580
 God performs a wedding ceremony

165
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,180
 with just Adam and just Eve.

166
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,460
 And Adam looks at her and sings the very first version

167
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,580
 of "Your Body's a Wonderland."

168
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,140
 He's like, "This naked girl's for me

169
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,380
 "and they're naked and without shame," the Bible says.

170
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,220
 It says this,

171
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,980
 "Because of this, a man will leave his father and mother

172
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,060
 "and hold fast to his wife

173
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,660
 "and they shall become one flesh.

174
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,700
 "And the man and his wife were both naked and not ashamed."

175
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,780
 Just two love birds running around in the garden of delight,

176
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,480
 which is what the word Eden means.

177
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,780
 And they experienced no shame.

178
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,700
 And then God says, "There's one command during this time,"

179
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,940
 you're probably familiar with it,

180
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,860
 "What was the one command?

181
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,180
 "You can't eat from this one tree.

182
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,800
 "Everything else, fair game,

183
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,820
 "just don't eat from the tree of the knowledge

184
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,660
 "of good and evil."

185
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,780
 That was the entire rule book,

186
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,860
 that was the entire Bible.

187
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,660
 The entire Bible could have fit on a fortune cookie.

188
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,300
 That was it, just don't eat from that one tree.

189
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,020
 Adam and Eve, like five minutes go by

190
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,700
 and they eat from the tree, of course,

191
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,560
 and all of a sudden sin enters the world

192
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,940
 and with it came shame and with it came anxiety.

193
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,540
 We're told that after eating it,

194
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,580
 their eyes were opened

195
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,580
 and Adam and Eve ran into essentially the forest

196
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,940
 and they ran from God.

197
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,380
 Previously, when they heard God coming,

198
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,740
 they ran towards him, now they run from him.

199
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,740
 Because they were afraid, because shame brings anxiety.

200
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,620
 The more that you and I hold on and hide things,

201
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,700
 you're gonna bring more and more anxiety in your life.

202
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,820
 Am I saying if you have anxiety,

203
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,660
 it's 'cause you're hiding something?

204
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,340
 No, I'm saying if you're hiding something,

205
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,980
 you're gonna bring anxiety into your life.

206
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,100
 It says this, Adam said, "When I heard you coming,"

207
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,240
 this is Genesis chapter three, verse 10,

208
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,900
 "the sound of you, God, in the garden,

209
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,820
 "I was afraid."

210
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,500
 Man's first interaction with fear, with anxiety,

211
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,680
 is introduced, "Because I was naked and I hid myself.

212
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,260
 "I was ashamed."

213
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,460
 Rather than bring their sin to God

214
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,340
 and what they had done to God, they ran from him

215
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,500
 and they began to attempt to hide

216
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
 what they were ashamed of in their life.

217
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,060
 All of us have gotten used to, I think,

218
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,180
 if Houston and most places around the country

219
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,820
 that are listening, or anything like Dallas,

220
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,980
 we've all gotten used to these.

221
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,020
 Anybody know what this is?

222
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,380
 This is an N95 mask that I'm pretty sure is a fake,

223
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,260
 but it nonetheless works to go into the store.

224
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,100
 And do you guys have like mask mandates?

225
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,980
 - Yeah. - Well, you have to,

226
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,940
 pretty much everywhere you go now.

227
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,260
 Such a weird time.

228
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,660
 Anyways, we've all gotten used to wearing these.

229
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,900
 The truth is, most of us have been wearing masks

230
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,000
 our whole life.

231
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,420
 You never told anybody about what happened to you.

232
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,940
 You experienced some sort of abuse.

233
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,020
 It wasn't your fault and you never told anybody.

234
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,180
 And you've been hiding.

235
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:42,020
 And the tragedy is, as long as you hide,

236
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,440
 God will not heal.

237
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,900
 And you're gonna carry shame that you don't have to.

238
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,540
 They cover it up with fig leaves.

239
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:55,020
 We hide today, we hide behind our words.

240
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,660
 We hide behind not telling people the truth.

241
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:03,360
 And anytime we do, the reality is,

242
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,940
 God cannot heal what we won't reveal.

243
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,780
 It's the second idea.

244
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,880
 So shame brings anxiety,

245
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,540
 but God won't heal what we will not reveal.

246
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,580
 Proverbs 28, verse 13 says this.

247
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,580
 Whoever conceals or hides their sin does not prosper,

248
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,860
 but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy.

249
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:30,700
 Solomon says, whoever hides or conceals their sin,

250
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,780
 what's going on, will not prosper.

251
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,700
 That sin's not going anywhere.

252
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,060
 If anything, it's only gonna get worse.

253
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,900
 But whoever confesses, who brings it out into the open,

254
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,740
 telling someone not just God,

255
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,780
 but other people in their life will experience healing.

256
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,460
 In other words, Solomon would say,

257
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,020
 anything that you and I refuse to bring others into,

258
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,020
 and I know it's all over this room, man,

259
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,780
 and God's not angry at you, and you're embarrassed,

260
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,020
 and you think I'm talking to you, and I am talking to you,

261
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,180
 and you're carrying shame for it, and you don't have to.

262
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,620
 And God who loves you says, anything you won't reveal,

263
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,620
 I cannot heal, I will not heal.

264
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,320
 But he invites you, it's possible.

265
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,600
 You can come out of hiding.

266
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,100
 You can experience freedom.

267
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,060
 And someday, you're thinking to yourself,

268
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,540
 I'm not gonna do this forever.

269
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,100
 When I get married, I'm gonna stop looking at pornography.

270
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,740
 When I get married, I'm gonna stop drinking so much.

271
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,780
 When I get married, I'm gonna stop doing this.

272
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,300
 Let me tell you the truth.

273
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,780
 That's not changing when you get married.

274
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,620
 That's changing when you stop hiding.

275
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,620
 Marriage doesn't make sin go away.

276
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,580
 If anything, it magnifies it.

277
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,340
 And anything that you say, nope, not bringing this out,

278
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,440
 is something where in effect, you say to God,

279
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,400
 I'm not allowing access to this in my life,

280
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,340
 because God will not heal what we are unwilling to reveal.

281
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,800
 So the flip side, the third idea,

282
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,480
 is that confession is the cure.

283
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,360
 Confession, and by confession, I mean,

284
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,160
 telling someone other than God.

285
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,280
 All of us, I know everybody in here,

286
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,040
 you know, you did it again, you slept together,

287
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,560
 you crossed the boundary with your boyfriend

288
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,920
 or your girlfriend that you promised

289
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,080
 you wouldn't do it again, and you go home,

290
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,400
 you lay on your pillow, and you say,

291
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,720
 God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, please forgive me.

292
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,720
 That type of confession, let me just be abundantly clear,

293
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,980
 biblically, is worthless.

294
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,640
 If you're a follower of Jesus, and you've confessed sin,

295
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,980
 you've trusted what Jesus has done,

296
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,440
 it says that you and I are to bring our confession

297
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,080
 to other people inside of our life,

298
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,880
 and by worthless, I don't mean it doesn't matter,

299
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,020
 or it's not practical, or anything,

300
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,680
 I mean, functionally, it does not change your behavior,

301
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,940
 because James says the way that you and I

302
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,060
 experience healing from behavior in our life

303
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,520
 is by confessing to another person.

304
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,160
 He says this, James, in James chapter five, verse 16,

305
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,240
 he says, "Confession is the cure.

306
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,660
 "Therefore, confess your sins to each other,

307
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:03,480
 "and pray for each other, so that you may be healed."

308
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,560
 Here's what I love about James writing this verse.

309
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,720
 Like, James just wrote, hey, here's,

310
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,080
 you wanna experience healing in your life,

311
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,760
 you wanna change, you wanna stop,

312
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,160
 here's the formula, he says,

313
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,020
 "Confess to another believer in your life,

314
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,200
 "have them pray for you, bring it out into the open,

315
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,760
 "and express that to another person,

316
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,400
 "and you'll experience supernatural healing."

317
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,600
 Think about who's writing this.

318
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,800
 You guys know who James is?

319
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,280
 James is the baby brother of Jesus.

320
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,120
 You guys know that?

321
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,400
 Like, Jesus had, like, little baby brothers.

322
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,440
 He had siblings, sisters, he had siblings in his life.

323
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,660
 How rough would that be?

324
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,560
 You think your older sister, firstborn, is perfect?

325
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,960
 How'd you like to follow Jesus,

326
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,200
 where every night you're sitting at the table with mom,

327
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,040
 and it's like, why can't you be

328
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,960
 a little bit more like Jesus?

329
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,080
 Well, mom, he's God.

330
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,000
 That can't be easy.

331
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,260
 But James didn't just see, like, his brother's perfect,

332
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,160
 you know, dinner table etiquette.

333
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,720
 He saw his brother give sight to the blind.

334
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,080
 He saw his brother do incredible, miraculous things,

335
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,720
 laying people, they couldn't walk their entire life,

336
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,040
 Jesus goes up, his big brother touches them, they can walk.

337
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,760
 He saw him give hearing back to people

338
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,280
 who had never been able to hear before,

339
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,100
 open the eyes of people to be able to see,

340
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,960
 allow people to speak, or give the tongue back to the mute.

341
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,680
 James saw all of this take place.

342
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,880
 He saw his brother supernaturally heal people.

343
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,680
 And then he writes this book we call James,

344
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,640
 and in it he says, if you wanna experience

345
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,800
 supernatural healing in your life, here's how.

346
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,860
 You gotta bring other people in.

347
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,880
 It's not going away.

348
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,680
 Maybe it's a hurt from a parent,

349
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,840
 there's something that happened to you,

350
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,340
 and it wasn't your fault, but it's not going away

351
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,200
 unless you bring someone in,

352
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,100
 unless you bring it out in the open.

353
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,100
 And share.

354
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,100
 And share.

355
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,700
 Which James says, confess,

356
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,700
 and you'll experience the supernatural healing in your life,

357
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,940
 'cause confession is the cure,

358
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,240
 it's a part of the equation every single time.

359
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,580
 I think one of the hardest lies

360
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,060
 that you're gonna have to get over right now

361
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,180
 is that if you bring it to your life Bible study group,

362
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,540
 or you bring it to your community group,

363
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,940
 to the soliciting, your small group, wherever you're at,

364
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,780
 the lie that you're thinking right now,

365
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,420
 "I can't share that, that's so embarrassing.

366
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,420
 "What are they gonna think about me?

367
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,000
 "They're gonna think I'm like some messed up pervert

368
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,900
 "who I can't believe you even do that,

369
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,180
 "or you're so messed up."

370
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,420
 Let me tell you abundantly clear,

371
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,500
 here's what they're gonna think about you, ready?

372
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,480
 You're gonna bring that to them?

373
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,980
 Their trust to believe in your life?

374
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,580
 Here's what they're gonna, everyone?

375
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,740
 They're gonna think you're a lot like them,

376
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,340
 only more honest.

377
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,480
 That's what they're gonna think.

378
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,660
 If they're a believer and a follower of Jesus,

379
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,660
 as Christians, all of us,

380
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,960
 in order to get into the club, if you will,

381
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,900
 you have to acknowledge, I'm not a perfect person,

382
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,720
 I need a savior.

383
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,340
 That's part of the starting line of being a Christian,

384
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,940
 is saying, "Don't have it all together?

385
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,280
 "I don't have it all together?

386
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,100
 "That's why I need Jesus, that's why I need a savior."

387
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,500
 And there's something messed up in the church

388
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,000
 where it's like, after you become a Christian,

389
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,420
 you can't be a Christian anymore,

390
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,980
 or you have to pretend like you have it all together,

391
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,500
 when the criteria for getting in is being someone

392
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
 who says, "I don't have it all together."

393
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,220
 Do you have people in your life

394
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,900
 where you can bring openly and honestly,

395
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,900
 you have a small group,

396
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,300
 do people know what's going on?

397
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,660
 You don't have to share it with everybody,

398
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,760
 you're right here on the stage every time.

399
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,340
 But are there people in your life that know

400
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,780
 how you're doing?

401
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,940
 They know about your dating relationship,

402
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,040
 they know about where if Satan was gonna take you out,

403
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,340
 or you're tempted to drift back towards old ways

404
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,420
 or old habits, do they know those things?

405
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,380
 Because you will not experience healing

406
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,280
 unless it involves you revealing it

407
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,380
 to other people inside of your life.

408
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,020
 This changed my life in my early 20s.

409
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:47,280
 When I was 12 years old, I was on a bus to a church camp.

410
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,720
 We stopped at this hotel, and we got off,

411
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,880
 everybody goes in the room, and when you're like 12,

412
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,720
 you're like, "Dude, look at this,

413
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,680
 "they got free soap in here, I'm taking it with me."

414
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,820
 And it's just the whole amazing, you know,

415
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,560
 kid hotel moment.

416
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,200
 And I was in a room with a guy who threw on the TV,

417
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,440
 and he immediately went straight to pornography.

418
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,140
 I'd never seen pornography before.

419
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,280
 It was like, I don't even know what to think about this.

420
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,840
 And as a guy, all the different wheels begin to turn,

421
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,000
 and I don't know how many minutes it lasted,

422
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,720
 but if I close my eyes or I think about it,

423
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,960
 I can see those images still.

424
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,080
 It takes a moment to see and a lifetime to get rid of.

425
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,800
 And that put me on a journey where for the next 10 years,

426
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,600
 I've struggled with pornography in my life as a Christian.

427
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,000
 And it wasn't something I was proud of,

428
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,960
 it wasn't something I wanted,

429
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,160
 it was something, honestly, I hated,

430
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,480
 but I was so afraid of what would happen

431
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,880
 if I actually told somebody that.

432
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,960
 And then when I was in college,

433
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,480
 it was my junior year of college,

434
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,680
 this guy who lived across the street,

435
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,840
 he busts in the door like he's Kramer on Seinfeld

436
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,640
 or something, and he says, "I don't wanna do it anymore.

437
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,200
 "I don't wanna do this anymore.

438
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,200
 "This is hurting my faith."

439
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,640
 And he began to talk about his pornography,

440
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,600
 and he just said, "I need you to hold me accountable.

441
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,720
 "I need you to know everything that I'm looking at."

442
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,160
 And it was the first time I'd ever seen anyone

443
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,360
 be that honest.

444
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,080
 And he said, "Hey, will you pray for me?

445
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,320
 "Will you hold me accountable?

446
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,560
 "I want you to help me."

447
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,920
 So of course I prayed for him,

448
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,120
 and in those moments, it was the first time

449
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,440
 I'd seen anybody be like that.

450
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,760
 And I prayed and I just said,

451
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,280
 "Before you go, you're gonna know that

452
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,600
 "that's a part of my life.

453
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,280
 "I don't want it to be that way."

454
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,280
 And that was a pivotal moment

455
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,480
 where for the rest of, like for years after that,

456
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,520
 we began to put a software on both of our phones,

457
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,600
 several other friends of ours

458
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,840
 that had all struggled with that

459
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,440
 and began to see everything that I was looking at

460
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,880
 on the internet, and I could see everything that he was.

461
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,360
 And through every time that I was tempted

462
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,840
 or every time that I looked at pornography again

463
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
 or masturbated again or did any of that again,

464
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,640
 I brought that to believers in my life.

465
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,600
 Said, "Pray for me.

466
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,280
 "I want you to know this."

467
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,760
 Even at a thought level before I ever even got there,

468
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,320
 I just said, "Here's what you need to know.

469
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,640
 "I saw this billboard driving down the road today

470
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,760
 "and I've been thinking about it since.

471
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,120
 "And I may wanna do something

472
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,200
 "that I don't want to do in my heart of hearts,

473
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,760
 "but I kinda wanna do it right now.

474
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,840
 "Will you please pray for me,

475
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,120
 "hold me accountable and know that."

476
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,440
 And it changed my life.

477
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,560
 I know inside of this room,

478
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,640
 it's not just pornography,

479
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,480
 it's prescription medication addiction.

480
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,040
 It's alcohol.

481
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,560
 It's cutting.

482
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,920
 It's a lot of stuff.

483
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,400
 Maybe it's a debt problem, it's out of control.

484
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,080
 And God is not angry at you.

485
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,120
 It's not why he's saying confess,

486
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,640
 he loves you so much he gave his life for you.

487
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,400
 And he doesn't want you to be owned and imprisoned.

488
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,480
 Maybe it's anxiety.

489
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,040
 And you're just not opening up with other people.

490
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,360
 You're afraid, like, what are they gonna think?

491
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,440
 Maybe it's depression.

492
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,800
 It's not always even a sin

493
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,560
 that we're hiding.

494
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,440
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

495
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,000
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

496
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,840
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

497
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,640
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

498
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,480
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

499
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,120
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

500
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,880
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

501
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,560
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

502
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,160
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

503
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,560
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

504
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,120
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

505
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,560
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

506
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,000
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

507
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,360
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

508
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,680
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

509
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,840
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

510
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,360
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

511
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,880
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

512
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,440
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

513
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,080
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

514
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,560
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

515
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,040
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

516
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,520
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

517
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,920
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

518
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,320
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

519
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,680
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

520
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,040
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

521
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,440
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

522
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

523
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,280
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

524
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,760
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

525
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,160
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

526
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,160
 It's not always a sin that we're hiding.

527
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,440
 They're angry, they're in conflict,

528
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,560
 they're experiencing division with one another.

529
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,320
 Addiction rates are through the roof.

530
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,240
 Suicide is through the roof.

531
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,120
 Depression is through the roof.

532
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,640
 And the church offers the only solutions to those problems.

533
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,240
 Which first starts with a relationship with Jesus

534
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,600
 and it starts with walking with God's people.

535
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,240
 Once you're connected to God's son.

536
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,520
 And day by day living authentically

537
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,080
 and confessing sin with other people.

538
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,520
 So my hunch is, dude,

539
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,280
 the brightest days of the church are ahead.

540
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,360
 Because we offer a solution to so many of the problems

541
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,460
 that are gonna plague in our plaguing society

542
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,840
 as much as they ever have before.

543
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,360
 But if God's gonna use you as a part of his body

544
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,080
 and in this way and in the mission that he has all of us,

545
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,840
 if you're a follower of Jesus on,

546
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,360
 you have gotta get healthy.

547
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,200
 Which means you gotta open up.

548
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,640
 And I'm not talking about if he's gonna use you

549
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,480
 to go into ministry.

550
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,880
 I'm saying if you're a Christian,

551
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,040
 you're on the planet, you are breathing

552
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,880
 because God has a purpose for you

553
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,000
 to know God and to make him known.

554
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,080
 But the degree to which he is going to use you

555
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,240
 will be limited to the degree to which you are willing

556
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,860
 to get things out in the open.

557
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:02,960
 We have this handheld vacuum that we keep in my kitchen.

558
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,960
 And it's one of those things that,

559
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,920
 it's like a black and decker.

560
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,440
 It's not the most impressive thing of all time.

561
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,500
 Gets the job done.

562
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,960
 Go around and when you have little kids,

563
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,160
 your floors are constantly dirty.

564
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,280
 So there's dirt and there's Cheerios and there's goldfish

565
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,400
 and just kind of stuff everywhere.

566
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,040
 So because of that, all my ladies in the house know

567
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,160
 that any mama out there, like she has like certain things.

568
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,720
 This is one thing I've realized about women,

569
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,640
 men is like they're okay with like clutter everywhere.

570
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,960
 And then there will be this one type of clutter

571
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,060
 not okay with.

572
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,040
 So this could be like, for her, it's like, man,

573
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,800
 hey, it could be disgusting room.

574
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,040
 Gotta have clean sheets.

575
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,280
 Gotta have clean sheets.

576
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,520
 If you're not clean, do not come into this bed.

577
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,840
 The other thing with her is floors.

578
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,960
 She's like, man, it can be just kind of chaos everywhere.

579
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,760
 I should have really shared this with her

580
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,600
 before I shared this story,

581
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,660
 but it can be chaos everywhere.

582
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,440
 And then, hey, just want clean floors.

583
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,360
 So we keep this vacuum nearby,

584
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,920
 get anything that's cut up.

585
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,200
 Every now and then, because it's a really small vacuum,

586
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,880
 there's like a small spout at the front of it.

587
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,240
 Don't we get something that will get lodged inside of there.

588
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,240
 What happens whenever like half of the vacuum is clogged up?

589
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,200
 It's operating at half capacity.

590
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,440
 It's not able to function or operate as well as it could

591
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,400
 'cause half of it is blocked.

592
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,040
 You know what's further interesting?

593
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,080
 It's like whenever like a goldfish gets stuck in there,

594
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,120
 it doesn't just block half of it.

595
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,840
 It also increases the likelihood

596
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,540
 that other things are going to get caught and blocked.

597
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:35,400
 Further decreasing its effectiveness.

598
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,120
 It's gonna have to do with you.

599
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,280
 Anytime you and I get something lodged in our spirit,

600
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,000
 in our soul, in our life, whether it's a sin,

601
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,160
 or maybe it's hurt,

602
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,560
 maybe it's something that happened to you,

603
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,280
 if you don't deal with it and get it out,

604
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,040
 you're not operating at 100% and you won't be.

605
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,280
 And just like in that vacuum illustration where,

606
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,160
 hey, man, as long as it's there,

607
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,880
 it's gonna block other things that are there.

608
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,460
 As long as you never deal with that hurt from your dad,

609
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,920
 you're gonna be more sensitive

610
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,560
 and more quickly prone to get hurt from other people.

611
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,520
 You're gonna pick up things that maybe in neutral,

612
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,160
 you wouldn't pick up, but you're gonna pick them up.

613
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,480
 As long as you're addicted to pornography,

614
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,760
 you're gonna walk around and every girl that you see

615
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,200
 or every guy that you see,

616
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
 you're gonna begin to think through

617
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,800
 what they would look like naked

618
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,520
 because there's something blocking there.

619
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,840
 And the more that, the longer that it's there,

620
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,780
 that problem's not going away.

621
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,040
 If anything, it is getting worse

622
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,720
 and you're not gonna operate

623
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,820
 and experience all that God wants for you.

624
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,360
 I don't know what that looks like for you tonight.

625
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,280
 To confess to another believer in your life.

626
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,060
 But I know that those who are in the room

627
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,120
 that are listening, that are thinking,

628
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,820
 and I'm talking to you, you know,

629
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,160
 there's somebody in your life

630
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,960
 you need to bring that forward to.

631
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,920
 Maybe it's a volunteer here,

632
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,400
 maybe it's a life Bible study here,

633
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,240
 maybe it's a community group for wherever you're listening.

634
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,720
 This is why we hammer being connected

635
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,280
 and being known and having relationships with other people

636
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,040
 'cause what you hide will not heal.

637
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,680
 When I was 22, I'll close here,

638
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:08,600
 I went to the dentist for the very first time.

639
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,000
 And it was an interesting experience.

640
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,520
 I'd never been before.

641
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,760
 I tell the story and people are like,

642
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,320
 how did your mom, what is your mom, parents not love you?

643
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,520
 I think I had straight teeth.

644
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,000
 And she was like, hey, get back in the game, you'll be fine.

645
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,720
 So when I was 22, I got dental insurance.

646
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,120
 I was like, oh man, this is exciting.

647
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,940
 I got dental insurance.

648
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,960
 I'm gonna go to the dentist, this is gonna be amazing.

649
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,720
 And I go, and your first time at the dentist,

650
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,080
 it was like I relived the seven-year-old experience

651
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,780
 you probably had where you're like, oh dude,

652
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,160
 the chairs, man, they got suckers afterwards.

653
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,080
 And I'm experiencing all of that at 22.

654
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,280
 And the dentist comes in, they do the X-rays, they take it.

655
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,640
 And he comes back and he says, I got good news,

656
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,000
 I got bad news.

657
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,600
 I said, all right, let's start with the good news.

658
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,400
 And he says, good news is your teeth

659
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,300
 are relatively straight.

660
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,960
 Okay, bad news is you have 14 cavities.

661
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,160
 Yeah, I know, I was like,

662
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,040
 what do I not have 14 teeth?

663
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,840
 What do you mean 14 cavities?

664
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,280
 He's like, first off, you have 32 teeth.

665
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,360
 Second off, there's three surfaces on every tooth,

666
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,740
 and so you can actually get three cavities

667
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,700
 on a single tooth, which I had done, thankfully.

668
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,280
 Or not thankfully. (laughs)

669
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
 Thankfully. (laughs)

670
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,240
 Oh, I'm sorry.

671
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,960
 He begins to go through a diagnostic list of questions

672
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,040
 of like, what are you doing?

673
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,560
 Are you drinking a lot of soda?

674
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,400
 What's your diet like?

675
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,280
 How often are you brushing your teeth?

676
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,580
 Are you sleeping with candy in your mouth?

677
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,440
 To find out what is causing this problem

678
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,240
 inside of my mouth.

679
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,960
 And of course, I wasn't doing that.

680
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,680
 I just didn't like to floss, but point being,

681
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,120
 that day, I did something that over and over,

682
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,880
 I feel like I've seen God have me do in life,

683
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,440
 and I've seen the power of when we do something similar

684
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,640
 as it relates to our spiritual life

685
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,360
 and our spiritual health.

686
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,520
 That day, I opened up my mouth,

687
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,720
 and I allowed somebody to look in

688
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,000
 and see things that I may not have seen.

689
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,420
 And when they identified or they saw something

690
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,500
 that may be harmful, that may be hurting,

691
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,440
 that may be leading to further brokenness down the road,

692
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,660
 they begin to say, "Hey, you need to make some changes

693
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,360
 "as it relates to your dental health."

694
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,560
 And the same way, that's the exact idea

695
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,820
 that the Bible says you and I are to do inside of our life,

696
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,300
 where we open up our lives,

697
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,780
 not our mouth to other people, but our lives,

698
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,060
 and we allow people to speak into

699
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,140
 the things that we're doing,

700
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,500
 to know where we're hurting ourselves, maybe,

701
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,340
 to know where we're struggling, where we're tempted,

702
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,620
 or we're just believing a lie.

703
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,540
 And if you do, you'll begin to experience

704
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,500
 healing inside of your life.

705
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,260
 And God has invited you, "Man, I don't want you

706
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,480
 "to live the rest of your days owning,

707
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,380
 "or having this own you.

708
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,740
 "How long are you gonna carry this?"

709
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,900
 And you keep pushing off, saying,

710
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,580
 "No, I'll deal with it later, I'll deal with it later."

711
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,540
 The day you'll deal with it is the day you decide,

712
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,380
 "I'm gonna bring it into the light."

713
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,780
 Why would you waste, why would any of us waste

714
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,600
 another moment believing the lie of one last time?

715
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,540
 It never works, it never happens.

716
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,780
 The one last time happens when you and I choose.

717
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,100
 I don't care what anyone thinks,

718
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,640
 I'm bringing it out into the open.

719
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,700
 And you'll begin to experience healing.

720
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,880
 If you're a follower of Jesus,

721
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,320
 there's nothing that can separate you from God's love.

722
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,380
 You'll spend eternity with Him forever,

723
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,580
 but He's invited you to experience

724
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,720
 greater and greater freedom on this earth.

725
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:44,900
 But that'll involve you and I opening up our lives

726
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,100
 to other people and letting them speak into,

727
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,020
 doing what Ephesians, I'm sorry,

728
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,020
 Hebrews chapter three, I'm closing here,

729
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:57,060
 says, "Take care, brothers, lest any of you

730
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,480
 have an evil, unbelieving heart,

731
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,820
 leading you to fall away from the living God.

732
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,480
 But exhort or call out one another daily,

733
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,920
 as long as it is called today,

734
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,920
 so that none of you would be hardened

735
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,300
 by the deceitfulness of sin."

736
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,560
 He says, "You want to experience the remedy

737
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,960
 for spiritual heart disease.

738
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,760
 It involves having other people in your life

739
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,280
 that can call you out where you need to be called out,

740
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,760
 that can call you," the word exhort,

741
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,040
 such a churchy word, just means,

742
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,400
 "I'm gonna call you to be everything

743
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,400
 that God wants you to be,

744
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,000
 everything that you and your heart of heart want to be.

745
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,440
 And I need you to lock arms with me,

746
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,400
 and I'm not letting go of you,

747
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,320
 and you're not letting go of me,

748
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,440
 and we're gonna walk through life like this together."

749
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
 If you don't have that,

750
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,000
 you're not gonna experience the abundant life

751
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,840
 God wants for you.

752
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,280
 And it's not coming from some church program

753
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,240
 where you sign up for this class

754
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,080
 and you'll experience that.

755
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,080
 It comes from having real relationships

756
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,760
 with people who, like you, are trying to follow Jesus,

757
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,160
 and we need one another.

758
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,320
 And you're not gonna experience healing,

759
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,520
 you're not gonna be the husband you wanna be,

760
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,800
 you're not gonna be the wife that you wanna be,

761
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,120
 you're not ready to get married if you don't have that.

762
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,840
 'Cause you got some stuff you gotta deal with.

763
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,400
 God already paid for it and dealt with it,

764
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,720
 consequence ultimately on the cross for that.

765
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,240
 But tonight and today and every day

766
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,280
 is a day where as believers,

767
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,560
 we go to war through opening up our mouth

768
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,320
 and saying, "This is where I'm struggling.

769
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,800
 I need you to know this."

770
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,440
 And when you do, when you do, when we do,

771
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,880
 healing happens.

772
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,000
 Or you can just keep hiding.

773
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Let me pray.

774
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,960
 Father, I pray for every person in this room

775
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:47,160
 who has walked through a difficult last six months.

776
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:52,360
 Maybe they've lost their job

777
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,720
 or they've lost somebody that they love,

778
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,840
 or they've just experienced anger and hurt

779
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,480
 and bitterness and confusion

780
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,760
 and all the emotions that all of us have felt.

781
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,240
 That in the midst of all of that pain,

782
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,400
 they turned to something to distract them

783
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,120
 or to help them cope with.

784
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:20,680
 And it was something that is owning and continuing to own.

785
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,280
 Maybe it was an eating disorder.

786
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,200
 Maybe it was an old relationship

787
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,120
 that had no business being in.

788
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,160
 Maybe it was a bottle of alcohol

789
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,560
 or a bowl of weed or whatever it was.

790
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,760
 And they keep feeding that and feeding that.

791
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,120
 And they're not opening up to anybody

792
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,480
 that you right now would pierce through their heart,

793
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,200
 give them the courage to follow you

794
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,600
 and to open up honestly

795
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,280
 and walk in the light with other people.

796
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,080
 And when they do, you meet them there

797
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,000
 in healing room, rush in.

798
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,960
 Just like you rush towards Adam and Eve

799
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,720
 to cover their sin,

800
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,240
 to call them out of hiding,

801
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,960
 that that would happen for friends all over this room.

802
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,800
 Thinking that Jesus paid for all of it on the cross.

803
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,560
 And we're not defined by anything other

804
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:14,400
 than our faith in Him and what He did on that cross.

805
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,840
 And we worship you now in song.

806
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,200
 I thank you for Port Houston,

807
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,000
 where the brightest and best days in your church be ahead

808
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,240
 because of the men and women in this room

809
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,000
 who radically go all in with you

810
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,200
 and they follow you with recklessness

811
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,240
 because they respond to the incredible love

812
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,120
 that you have recklessly poured out for all of us.

813
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,400
 We worship you now in song, amen.

814
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,740
 (whooshing)
