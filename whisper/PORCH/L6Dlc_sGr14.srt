1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 What is joy, buddy?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 I don't know.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 It's a dream!

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 [music]

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Alright, Porch, how we doing?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 We doing okay?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Great to see you.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Welcome back.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 So glad that you would make time to be here with us this evening.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Special shout out to everybody that is tuning in online.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Dallas, you look good.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I can't see you on the camera, but I'm assuming you look good as well.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 And we're so glad that wherever it is you are, you're tuning in with us tonight.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Special shout out to all of our Porch Live locations, but particularly Fort Worth, Dayton, and Scottsdale.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Well, Porch, let me ask you a question.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Have you ever been a part of a situation that was surprisingly sadder than it should have been?

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 You ever been a part of one of those situations?

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 I know I have been in many of those situations over the course of my life, but there is one that stands out above the rest.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 You see, several years ago, Brooke and I got invited to attend a wedding.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And it had all the markings of being this amazing experience.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Like this couple were two of the best people that we knew.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Their families were incredible to say the least.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 They had friends and family that were flying in from around the nation to be here on this special wedding day.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 The weather was awesome.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 The venue was outdoors.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 The sun was setting.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 It had that golden hour glow that everybody loves to take pictures around.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 There was a river nearby that was running with swans in its wake.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Like it was a perfect setup.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 It should have been amazing.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And listen, the ceremony was.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Like there were vows shared between the bride and the groom that were personal.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Every story that was spoken was intentional.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 The gospel was shared.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 But then the reception happened.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Or it didn't happen.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Might be a more apt way of describing it.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Because while everybody had shown up to the reception, it felt like the party never got to the reception.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 You ever been in one of those before?

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Like yeah, they had cake in the corner and the tables were set and food was getting passed around.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 It was a fajita feast that night, which I personally love.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 And yet they were missing one critical element that is necessary for every wedding reception.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Music.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 My thoughts exactly.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 You see, the day of, the DJ had called in sick.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Which left the catering services busboy commissioned with the noble task of emceeing this event

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 and making sure the party kept going, that the show would not stop.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And yet he was very unfit for the challenge.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 So what do you do in a moment like that?

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 When you see things are off the rails, this deserves to be celebrated, and yet no one's taking any action.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 You look at your wife and you tell her to hold your drink because this party's not going down without a fight.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 You know, you get in the DJ booth, son.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 You hop up, which is exactly what I did.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Now listen, I understand the limits of my qualifications being behind a turntable.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 I have no business being in that environment.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 But it doesn't take a genius to turn the house lights off, to turn the disco lights up, and to play the cha-cha slide.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Everybody loves it. I don't care what you think.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 It gets people on the dance floor.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And boy, were they dancing.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Dance the night away.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Like that's what was happening that entire time.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Like we were celebrating. We were rejoicing.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 We were appropriately responding to what was this amazing event.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Like these two beautiful people had just made the biggest decision in their life to enter into covenantal relationship,

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 loving union for this life and ever.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And the most inappropriate response would have been to be apathetically sitting nearby, counting down the clock,

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 until we gave them their grand send-off.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 No, the right thing was to rejoice.

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 It was to celebrate. It was to party.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 It was to praise the fact that they had stepped into something so significant.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Why do I tell you that?

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Because I've talked to so many of you, and what I've found is that a lot of you have made the biggest decision in your life.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Not that you've gotten married. That's why you're here.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And yet, many of you have already made the biggest decision in that—you laugh, you just know it's true—

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 you've made the biggest decision in that you have already entered into loving relationship with Jesus Christ.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And yet, your experience since the day that you entered into that relationship

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 feels less exciting and more synonymous with the somber soundtrack of whatever spiritual busboy is sitting in the DJ booth of your life.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 You look at your situation, the circumstances of your life, the qualities that mark your walk with God,

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 and what you feel is apathy, disinterest, maybe some occasional optimism, but you feel infrequent satisfaction.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 If that's you here tonight, then hold my drink, because I'm here to save your party.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 That's what this series is. This series is a—it's a—it's the most valiant attempt I can make

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 at helping you engage with the kind of life that Jesus actually wants you to have.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Like, he doesn't want you to settle for something melancholic or apathetic, indifferent in life.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 He wants you to experience unbridled, overwhelming joy.

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 That's the promise that the gospel puts forward, and so I want to help you engage with a God that wants you to be joyful,

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 which is something that so many of us, if we're honest, can't begin to relate to.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 You see, according to the World Happiness Report, which came out last week for this year on International Happiness Day,

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 it reported that our country, the United States of America, for the very first time since the report has actually been composed,

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 fell outside of the top 20 worldwide. We came in at number 24.

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 But that's not even the most alarming thing. Like, despite the fact that the United States, year after year,

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 as the report has been issued, has been declining in the ranks of our general happiness as a country,

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 the most alarming fact was that when you polled the group of young adults from within America,

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 we went from number 24 to number 62.

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 You see, we are the most unhappy segment of our country.

95
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Founding editor of the Happiness Report, John Hallowell, said,

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 "The low scores among young people aren't a matter of less education or lower income or bad health.

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Instead, it must be attributed to a matter of mood, how we generally feel about life itself."

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Now, it's important to acknowledge that while the science is very even debated to some extent,

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 30 to 40% of your happiness in life is genetically impacted,

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 which helps to explain why some of us are more or less prone to positivity than others,

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 which if that's you, if melancholy or apathy is a part of your normal experience, we're going to get to that.

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Maybe this isn't even the case. Maybe for you, it's something clinical.

103
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Like, it's a diagnosed depression.

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 If it's something in your life that aligns with mental health challenge or struggle in any way whatsoever,

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 we're going to get to a place where we talk about these things and we present to you how joy is still possible in your experience.

106
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And yet, regardless of whatever your genetic predisposition is,

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 it is nonetheless true that happiness is one of, if not the leading priority for our generation.

108
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Like, we want to be happy. Like, we seek to be happy.

109
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Do you want to be happy? Do you want to be happy? Do you want to be happy? Do you want to be happy?

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 I bet you're trying to be happy, and yet what this report is saying is that we are increasingly unhappy

111
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 as we try our best, and we're finding ourselves falling in the ranks because we're not as satisfied as we want to be in life.

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 What are we getting wrong?

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Not just for the secular sitting in this room, but even for the spiritual.

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Like, Christians are not omitted from this data.

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Like, what you find is that too many believers today, they claim to know where the source of all satisfaction is found.

116
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 It's found in Jesus, and yet they look so very joyless.

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 This is the case for some of you. This was the case for me.

118
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Like, just a couple years ago, at the end of 2023, I found myself in a spot where I was standing on stage

119
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 and I was telling people where joy was found, but then I would walk off the stage and I would wonder how I'd lost it myself.

120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Like, I felt like a spiritual snake oil salesman to some degree.

121
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Like, I was pawning off on everybody what would work for them, but man, it just was not working in my life.

122
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Some of you can relate to this experience. No?

123
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 If you can, then listen to me.

124
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 The logical explanation is not that this isn't true.

125
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 It's that we've gotten something wrong.

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 The logical explanation is we have gotten something wrong.

127
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 So many of us, we know everything about Jesus, but we don't feel anything for him.

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And if that's you, if you're somewhere short of satisfied in life, if you're wondering, "Man, where did I go wrong?"

129
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Then you're in the right place because we want to help you get your joy back.

130
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 But before we can know how to find joy, we've got to talk about what joy is, which is the goal of tonight.

131
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Like, the goal of our evening here is to just lay a foundation for what joy actually is.

132
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 If you don't know what it is, then you don't know where to find it.

133
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 I'll just say this from the outset here week one as we move through this series in the coming weeks.

134
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 That's so much of what I'm going to share with you.

135
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 So many of the ideas that I have have been developed through the brilliance of people like G.K. Chesterton, Dallas Willard, John Mark Comer, and John Tyson.

136
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 There's four for me to name, but there's so many others.

137
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 And I want to acknowledge them because you're going to see their thumbprints all over the series as we work our way through.

138
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 But as we begin, we've got to talk about what is joy before we can talk about where is joy.

139
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Because before we can learn how to experience it, we need to unpack the essence of it.

140
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Because therein lies the problem for so many of us.

141
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Like, without knowing what joy is, we won't know where to look for it.

142
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 So recently, just a couple months ago, I found myself in Target trying to pull together the biggest birthday bash possible for my wife.

143
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 She had turned 30, and so it was a big deal.

144
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Like, I needed to make sure that we had all of the markings of a good birthday celebration at the home.

145
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And so I went into Target, I was looking for confetti, and I was trying to find streamers, and I wanted to find a card and some flowers,

146
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 and I wanted to find those big, foiled balloons.

147
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 You know which ones I'm talking about?

148
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 The ones that everybody loves to blow up and have for their birthday?

149
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 That was the object of what I was looking for.

150
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 And so I walk into Target, I make my way over to the arts and crafts section, and the balloons are nowhere to be found.

151
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Makes no sense.

152
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 This is exactly where they should be.

153
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 This is decor for my wife's birthday.

154
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Where are the balloons?

155
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 And so I make a lap around Target, I take another lap around Target, I make a third lap around Target,

156
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 and now, so frustrated, I find an employee, and I humble myself before them, and I ask them, "Where are the foiled, big, numbered balloons?"

157
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 And they said to me, "They are not in the arts and crafts section. They are in the party supplies section."

158
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 You see, I thought I knew what I was looking for, but I was mistaken.

159
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 It's not arts and crafts. It's party supplies.

160
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 And the minute I had clarified what it was, I knew where to go and look for it.

161
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 So what is joy?

162
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 If you don't know what it is, you will not know where to find it.

163
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 So here's a definition for you.

164
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Joy is a lasting emotion that is not achieved in life, but received from God, who felt it first and feels it most.

165
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Joy is a lasting emotion that is not achieved in life, but received from God, who felt it first and feels it most.

166
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Which may come as a surprise to some of us, because when we think of what mood God is actually in, joy does not normally spring top of mind.

167
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 It doesn't crack the top ten.

168
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Instead, something different likely comes to mind.

169
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 When we picture the face of God as he's staring back at us, we interpret a different mood altogether.

170
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Like, just try it for yourself for a minute.

171
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 When you think of what mood God is in, what do you come up with?

172
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 This is not rhetorical. This is conversational.

173
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 What mood do you see on God's face as he looks at you right now here tonight?

174
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Proud?

175
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 What else?

176
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Disappointment?

177
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Delighted?

178
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Joy, love?

179
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Faithful?

180
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Happy?

181
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Anybody else?

182
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Patient?

183
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Okay, here's what's fascinating about the answers we just gave.

184
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 So many of the answers we gave are attributes of God.

185
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 They're not attitudes of God.

186
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 You see, often what we think about when we think of the mood of God is we look at him, and what we find is we're not comfortable with the attitude he may be showing,

187
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 and so we'll ascribe an aptitude instead, because the attitude we may see is we may see that he is disappointed.

188
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 That's one that has hung over my life for so very long.

189
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Maybe we look at him and we see that he's angry.

190
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 He could be frustrated.

191
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 He might be indifferent or apathetic or annoyed.

192
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 I don't know what mood you may see on the face of God, and yet what we know is that when we consider who God is, not who we are, but who he actually is, joy is a really logical mood for him to take.

193
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Dallas Willard says it like this, "Central to the understanding and proclamation of the Christian gospel today is a re-visioning of what God's own life is like and how the physical cosmos fits into it.

194
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 It is a great and important task to come to terms with what we really think when we think of God.

195
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 We should, to begin with, think that God leads a very interesting life."

196
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 I love that.

197
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 He must lead a very interesting life, and that he is full of joy.

198
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Undoubtedly, he is the most joyous being in the universe.

199
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 You see, fundamental to finding joy is the understanding that God is the most joyous being in the universe.

200
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And it doesn't take long to learn that this is the case in the scripture.

201
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Like, you just turn to page one.

202
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 You read Genesis chapter one, and what you find is that God is making day after day after day, and he is consistently attributing to them goodness.

203
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 He says, "That one's good, and that one's good, and oh, when you look, that one's good, the fourth one's good as well."

204
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 He runs the full gamut and finds they're all good.

205
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Listen, God is not full of himself.

206
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 He is not self-inflated.

207
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 He is not easily impressed.

208
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 God is truthful.

209
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And so when he says that these days are good, it's because they are.

210
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 They're good days.

211
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And yet what you see as he talks to Job later in the Old Testament, as he's describing the creation narrative, he says,

212
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 "Where were you when I laid the earth's foundations?

213
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Tell me if you understand.

214
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Who marked off its dimensions?

215
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Surely you know.

216
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Who stretched a measuring line across it?

217
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 On what were its footings set?

218
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Or who laid its cornerstone?

219
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 While the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy."

220
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Listen, the angels, they react to God's work of creation in a way that wasn't just awe or applause or a polite golf clap in the background.

221
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 They are losing their ever-loving mind.

222
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Like, did you just see what he did?

223
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 He breathed out the stars.

224
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Like, he stretched the universe across.

225
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 He just laid the foundations of the earth.

226
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Oh, my God!

227
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Like, that's the reaction of the angels.

228
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 They're less like a church choir and more like sports fanatics, the Bills Mafia, you know?

229
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Like, they're doing all of that stuff as they watch God do what God does.

230
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 And yet they're not the only ones that approve of him.

231
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Like, God approves of his own work.

232
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 You see, when the seventh day comes around, he chooses to rest.

233
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Why?

234
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 It's not because he's tired.

235
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 God does not fatigue.

236
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 He does not rest from his work.

237
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 He enjoys his work.

238
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Like, that Sabbath day is a declaration of a desire to delight.

239
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 That's what God's doing in that moment.

240
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 You see, Sabbath, for you and for me, it is less about recovering from our work, and it's more about rejoicing in God.

241
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 That's what he was doing.

242
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 That's what we should do, too.

243
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 Or if that's not enough for you, like, just keep going.

244
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Because as you read further through the Old Testament, you find all of these festivals.

245
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Specifically, there are three festivals that God gives to the nation of Israel.

246
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 They are pilgrimage festivals, Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles.

247
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 And God required them to honor these every single year.

248
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Now, listen, these festivals for sure were considered holy conventions for the people of God.

249
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And yet they weren't just holy conventions.

250
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 They were joyous occasions.

251
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Like, it was a chance for the people of God to get back together and remember what God had done.

252
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Did you see that?

253
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 I remember when he did that.

254
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 And to break bread and to sing songs and to play music and to reminisce about all that had happened and dream about what God would do.

255
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Like, this is the nature of these festivals.

256
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 As just one example, look at what Nehemiah records in chapter 8 when he's talking about the festival of Tabernacles.

257
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 And the people have just heard Ezra read the law of the Lord.

258
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 It says this.

259
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 "So the people, they went out and they brought back branches and built themselves temporary shelters on their own roofs, in their courtyards, in the courts of the house of God, and in the square, by the water gate and the one by the gate of Ephraim.

260
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 The whole company that had returned from exile built temporary shelters and they lived in them."

261
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Again, this is the festival of booths or Tabernacles.

262
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 "From the days of Joshua, the son of Nun until that day," meaning as far back as you can think, "the Israelites had not celebrated it like this.

263
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 And their joy was very great."

264
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I would have loved to have been there to see it.

265
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Like, the recording is, man, they have never gotten this crazy.

266
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Like, they are wild about what God did.

267
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Like, they're remembering how he led them through the wilderness and brought them to the promised land.

268
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 And since the days of Joshua, they have never responded like this.

269
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 They are so full of joy.

270
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 They are partying like you wouldn't believe.

271
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 They are rejoicing at the goodness of God.

272
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Like, in this scene, everyone's come back to Jerusalem.

273
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 They have set up booths or temporary Tabernacles and they are celebrating his goodness for not one day, but an entire week.

274
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 How good is it of God that he would command them to celebrate for a week?

275
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 That's pretty awesome.

276
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 You know, like, you might get up and have a good time one night, but he's like, "Hey, try and put seven of those together."

277
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Like, this thing has more in common with tailgating in our modern day than anything else you might be thinking.

278
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Like, it's similar.

279
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 They show up and they get the gang back together.

280
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 They pull up for the big event.

281
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 They pitch their tents and they start roasting the barbecue and they got the music playing in the background.

282
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 And they pull out the old photo albums.

283
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 They start sharing stories with each other and they're throwing the pigskin.

284
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Just kidding.

285
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 That's not a joke.

286
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 They're Jews and that would be unclean.

287
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 They're not throwing any pigs around.

288
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 They're just having a good time.

289
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 This is just one of three pilgrimage festivals, seven religious festivals, and it's not including New Moon Feasts, regular Sabbath celebrations, and the year of Jubilee.

290
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 The year of Jubilee.

291
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 You know, that festival that happened every 50 years that served as a gigantic reset button on every mistake and every debt and every misstep you ever took.

292
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 That's not worth celebrating, is it?

293
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 That someone would look at everything you did wrong and say, you know what, reset.

294
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 That's all gone.

295
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 God is so joyful and he wants his people to be joyful.

296
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Like, it's not evil of him or wrong of him or malicious of him to command us to party.

297
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 And yet our experience does not feel like that, does it?

298
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 We must have gotten something wrong.

299
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 You see, God wants to remind us tonight of what he's done.

300
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Yes, as we look through the Old Testament that he delivered his people out of Egypt and he moved them through the wilderness and he forgave their sins and he blessed their harvest and he made sure to preserve their families and legacies forever.

301
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 But we also should remember what he's done in our life.

302
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 We should recall and recollect and even share with one another the goodness of God in our day.

303
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Because every single example is a declaration of his joyfulness and the joy he wants you to come into.

304
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 You see, God is joyful at heart.

305
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 He wants you to be the same.

306
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 He wants you to be very happy, which puts some of you on your heels.

307
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Like, you hear that and you're like, "Whoa, hold on.

308
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 That feels like a massive contradiction to everything I ever learned in church growing up.

309
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 God doesn't want me to be happy.

310
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 He wants me to be holy.

311
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 He doesn't care about how I feel.

312
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 He only cares about my character.

313
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 He doesn't care about what I'm doing so long as I'm doing it like Jesus, right?

314
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 God is much more interested in me becoming like Christ than anything else.

315
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And yet, I wouldn't disagree with you nor would the author of Hebrews, but listen to what he says about Jesus.

316
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 He says, "You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness.

317
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 This is why God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy beyond your companions."

318
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 If our walk is a walk where we get to become like that, joyful beyond comparison, I'm in.

319
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Like, that sounds pretty awesome.

320
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Like, yes, everything God is doing is trying to form you into the image of his son, as Romans 8 would say.

321
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 And the image of his son is one that has a joy which surpasses that of anybody else.

322
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Like, Jesus is incomparably happy.

323
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 He is exceptionally glad.

324
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 He is supremely pleasant, so pleasant that no one else can even come close in comparison.

325
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 And if you don't take that or me for enough evidence, then just look at the life of Christ.

326
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Like, his birth was heralded as good news of great joy for all people, Luke 2.10.

327
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 His kingdom was proclaimed as a place of everlasting joy, Romans 14.17.

328
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 So cheerful was Jesus in life that people claimed he was a glutton and a drunkard.

329
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Listen, you don't get a reputation like that by being a stick in the mud.

330
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 You know what, man? You have too much to eat and you might have too much to drink.

331
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 You look a little too happy with yourself.

332
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 That's Luke 7.34.

333
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 He performed miracles that astounded crowds and sent the sick rejoicing, Matthew 15.30.

334
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 He was happy in the Holy Spirit, Luke 10.21.

335
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 His life's work was the joy of saving people, Luke 15.3-7.

336
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 He joyfully endured the cross, despising its shame, Hebrews 12.2.

337
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And he gives joy to all that see him.

338
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 A joy that will never, ever be taken away, John 16.22.

339
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Jesus is far more full of glee and gladness and gaiety than you think.

340
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 John Piper, if all of that's not enough, would say that Jesus Christ is the happiest being in the universe.

341
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 His gladness is greater than all the angelic gladness of heaven.

342
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 He mirrors perfectly the infinite, holy, indomitable mirth,

343
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 which means amusement or laughter of his father.

344
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Which means that as we become more like Christ, shouldn't we be happy too?

345
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 You see, Jesus, he wants to make you into a person that is deeply joyful.

346
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 Jesus wants to make you into a person that's deeply joyful, but Kylan, like...

347
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 There's a difference between joy and happiness.

348
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Surely you know this. Like, you've grown up in the church, you've spent time around Christians.

349
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 These are not the same thing. Yeah, I believe God wants to make me joyful, but this whole thing about happiness?

350
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 I'm not real sure that that makes sense.

351
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Who says? Like, the Bible doesn't say that.

352
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 The Bible does not in any way ever suggest that joy and happiness should be disassociated from one another.

353
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 In fact, when you read the scriptures, there are multiple examples.

354
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I'll just give you a few of where those two qualities, joy and happiness, sit side by side.

355
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 They are paired together. Psalm 32, 11.

356
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Rejoice in the Lord and be happy, you who are godly.

357
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Shout for joy, all you who are morally upright.

358
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Psalm 68, 3. But may the righteous be glad and rejoice before God.

359
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 May they be happy and joyful.

360
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Psalm 100, 1 and 2. Sing to the Lord all the world.

361
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Worship the Lord with joy. Come before him with happy songs.

362
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Psalm 118, 24. This is the day that the Lord has made.

363
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Let us rejoice and be glad or happy in it.

364
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 I could keep going, but you get the point.

365
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 You cannot drain joy of its emotional element and call it joy.

366
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Yet so many of us do this so very often.

367
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 You see, so many of us have fallen prey that this is the life God has called us to live.

368
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Like for so many, Christianity, it's about doing the right things more than feeling the right way.

369
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Like it's all about religious creeds and observances.

370
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 That I come to church on Sundays and I give when the plate passes.

371
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 And I attend group on the weekdays.

372
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 And I make sure to keep my nose clean in the weekends.

373
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And I try to do my best to confess my sins and pray my prayers.

374
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 I want to fear the Lord as well as I can.

375
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Like we do everything right, but we feel totally wrong.

376
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 Like we've adopted all the right habits, but we have lost the right heart.

377
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 God wants so much more for you, Christian.

378
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 He wants so much more for you than boring belief.

379
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Than a belief that will not compel the world to watch and wonder.

380
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 And yet leaves them so underwhelmed with this God you believe in.

381
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 That they dare question if you even believe it yourself.

382
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Dallas Willard, another quote says, "How many people are radically and permanently repelled from the way."

383
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 That's talking about Christianity by Christians.

384
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 "Who are unfeeling, stiff, unapproachable, boringly lifeless, obsessive and dissatisfied."

385
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Yet such Christians are everywhere.

386
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 And what they are missing is the wholesome liveliness.

387
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Springing from a balanced vitality with the freedom of God's loving rule.

388
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 You see, spirituality, wrongly understood or pursued.

389
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Is a major source of human misery and rebelling against God.

390
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 So, what am I telling you then?

391
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Like you shouldn't do it if it doesn't make you feel good.

392
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Like you're only obedient if it makes you happy.

393
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 You should only pursue holiness so long as it preserves your joy.

394
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 No, what I am saying is that if your obedience is costing you happiness.

395
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Or your holiness is empty of joy.

396
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Then something is certainly wrong.

397
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 It's certainly wrong because that is not the way that God designed it.

398
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 God does not want your begrudging submission.

399
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 He's not interested in your religious compliance.

400
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 What he is interested in is the happiness of your soul.

401
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 That's what he wants for you.

402
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Like in a way, unhappiness in our life should be a red flag or a signal flare.

403
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 That something needs to change.

404
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Like no different than if you woke up tomorrow morning and your back hurt.

405
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 "Oh, yeah, like rough night."

406
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 And you went to sleep again and you woke up and it was still hurting.

407
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 And you went to sleep again and it was still hurting.

408
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 You wouldn't likely respond by saying, "You know what? It's making me tougher."

409
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Instead, you'd get rid of the mattress.

410
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 You would dispose of it quickly.

411
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 You would make sure to take note of the fact that this isn't the way my sleep should be conducted.

412
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 I'm left feeling worse. I should feel better.

413
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 It should raise a concern.

414
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 And yet here's the thing, porch.

415
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Too often we are willing to tolerate our spiritual discomfort because it's just what we're supposed to do.

416
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 I'm just supposed to walk with God even though it doesn't feel right.

417
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 I'm just supposed to read my Bible even though I haven't gotten anything out of it in weeks.

418
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 I'm just supposed to confess my sin even though no one's actually holding me accountable.

419
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 I'm just supposed to go to church even though I'm just going to keep up appearances.

420
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 We do all of the right things, but we don't feel any of the right way.

421
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 And that should be deeply disturbing to us.

422
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 It's deeply disturbing to God.

423
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 He doesn't want that for you.

424
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 Now listen, I'm not saying that there is not a place for discipline in your life.

425
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 We're going to talk about it.

426
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 And yet just within the concept of what joy is,

427
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 it is the offer on the table for you from Jesus as he tries to form you, morph you, mold you into his image.

428
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 Jesus did not begrudge God's word.

429
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 He did not begrudge going to synagogue.

430
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 He did not begrudge gathering with the saints.

431
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 He found joy in it always.

432
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 He wants you to find that too.

433
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 He wants to lead you into deeper waters of delight,

434
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 into a place where you can't swim, but God, he's going to show up and provide.

435
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 So if your soul's unsatisfied, if your heart is unhappy,

436
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 then the chances are good that you're pursuing joy in the wrong things.

437
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 You're looking to the world. You're not looking to God.

438
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 You're inspecting transient things.

439
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 You're not looking to transcendent things.

440
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 That's why jobs and guys and girls and trips and influence and pay and a better body,

441
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 relief from your pain is leaving you empty.

442
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Not saying those things are inherently bad, but gosh, they are certainly insufficient to satisfy.

443
00:33:49,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 G.K. Chesterton said this, and this quote was what began my deliverance from joyless despair.

444
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 He said, "Joy, which was the small publicity of the pagans,

445
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 is the gigantic secret of the Christian."

446
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Which just means that while the world is quick to promise and promote that joy is found right here,

447
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 the secret is that Christians are the only ones who ever find it.

448
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Christians are the only ones who ever actually find joy.

449
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Why is that? Well, John Mark Comer says, "Joy is more than an emotion.

450
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 It is a condition of the heart." It's a condition of the heart.

451
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 As he unpacks that idea, he turns to the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew chapter 5,

452
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 and he starts working through the Beatitudes.

453
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 I remember studying the Beatitudes with a Bible study group,

454
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 a group of guys that I was discipling a few years ago.

455
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 And as we were working through it, looking at the original language,

456
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 that word for blessed, which is blessed are the poor in spirit,

457
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 blessed are the meek, blessed are those who mourn,

458
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,

459
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 blessed are those who are persecuted.

460
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 That word blessed can also be synonymously interpreted as happy,

461
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 which just feels odd.

462
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 Like, how can I be happy when I'm persecuted?

463
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 How can I be happy whenever I'm hungry or thirsty?

464
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 How can I be hungry whenever I'm poor in spirit?

465
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 How can I be hungry when I'm meek?

466
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 Jesus, this doesn't make any sense.

467
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 Yet Jesus is saying that your happiness does not depend on what the world does to you.

468
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 It depends on what God is doing in you.

469
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 That's where your happiness depends.

470
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 It depends on what God is doing in you, not what the world does to you.

471
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 So what is he doing? What is God doing in your life?

472
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 He is making you more like Jesus,

473
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 which means he is actively, persistently, and constantly deepening your joy.

474
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 That's what he wants.

475
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 God is more interested in your joy than you are.

476
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 He wants for your satisfaction more than you do.

477
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 And he is begging you to take him up on the offer.

478
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 And the reason for that is because in Jesus,

479
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 we find not just the feeling of joy, but the fullness of joy.

480
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 In Jesus, we find not just the feeling of joy, but the fullness of joy,

481
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 that persists through every trial or trouble or tribulation,

482
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 that permeates our entire being.

483
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Whether you walk into the office or you go to pick up your mail,

484
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 or you're strolling through Trader Joe's,

485
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 or you come and sit with your friends,

486
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 it doesn't matter where you are, it's permeating your entire being.

487
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 But it doesn't just persist or permeate,

488
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 it also promotes to the watching world the wonder of the glory of God.

489
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 That's the kind of joy he's bringing you into.

490
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 Like that's why Jesus says in John 10, 10, "Hey, I came that you might have life."

491
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 He could have just said that.

492
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 But he goes further, "That you might have life abundantly."

493
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 John 15, 11, "These things I've spoken to you that my joy might be in you."

494
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 But he goes further, "That your joy may be full."

495
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 John 16, 24, "Until now you've asked nothing in my name, ask and you will receive."

496
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 But he goes further, "That your joy may be full."

497
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 John 17, 13, "I am coming to you now, but I say these things that while I am still in the world,

498
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 so that they might have not just my joy within them,

499
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 but the full measure of my joy within them."

500
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 Like Jesus has come not just so you can feel joy, but so you can be joyful.

501
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 You understand the difference in feeling joy and being joyful?

502
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 I've used this illustration before, but it's the difference in normal acting and method acting.

503
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Like in normal acting, you have someone that looks the part whenever the cameras are rolling.

504
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 But in method acting, you have someone that lives the part when the cameras are off.

505
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 That's the difference.

506
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 One is the event of acting.

507
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 The other is the embodiment of acting.

508
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 That's what Jesus wants for you.

509
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 Like he wants you to move beyond the event of joy into the embodiment of it.

510
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 He doesn't just want you to feel joy.

511
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 He wants you to be joyful.

512
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 So the natural next question, after hearing all of this,

513
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 and I've railed at you and I've yelled at you,

514
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 and I've probably annoyed some of you to some extent.

515
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 The natural next question is, "Well, then how do we find it?"

516
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 That's actually not the natural next question.

517
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 Because in asking that, we assume something too important to make any estimations or guesses about,

518
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 which is this, "Do you actually even want it?"

519
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 "Do you actually even want this, the kind of joy that Jesus is offering to you?"

520
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 Some of you, you don't want full joy.

521
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 You don't want full joy.

522
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 If you did, if everybody in this room wanted fullness of joy and was ready to go all in with Jesus,

523
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 you would be deeply satisfied and I would be without a job.

524
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Lord, I pray that would happen at the porch, because I want you to be joyful.

525
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 I want you to go in, all in with him.

526
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 But some of you, you don't want full joy.

527
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 You want instant gratification.

528
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 You want fleeting pleasures.

529
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 You want quick coping mechanisms just to make you feel okay for the day.

530
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 Here's the thing.

531
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 You will be content to try it on your own until you realize just how discontent you are on your own.

532
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 You will do your best, but it will never, ever be enough.

533
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 But some of you are here.

534
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 And you are ready to go all in.

535
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 You do want full joy, not joy like the world promises, but the joy that Jesus promises.

536
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 You're ready for that.

537
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 You're wanting for that.

538
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 You're serious about this.

539
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 What you need to know is that Jesus has always been serious about your joy, too.

540
00:40:48,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 He's been so serious about your joy, so much so that the most joyous being in the universe would come to the most joyless beings in the universe.

541
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 That happiness from on high would come to our despair down here low.

542
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 Jesus wanted you so badly to be a person of joy that he himself would bear in himself all the sorrow of your sin.

543
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 You see, Jesus wants to take your bruising, your brokenness, and he wants to mold them, form them, redeem them, reconcile them back into blessings.

544
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 He's willing to do whatever it takes.

545
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 He might have joy even at the cost of his own life.

546
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 He'll come to live the perfect life, but he'll die the death you actually do deserve, for all sin is deserving of condemnation.

547
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 And yet he would be condemned in our place that we might find liberation.

548
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 We might go free forever.

549
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 But that's not all.

550
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 He wants you to find more than a feeling, but the fullness of joy so much so that he won't just give it to you right now.

551
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 He won't just give it to you tomorrow.

552
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 He won't just give it to you next week.

553
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 He won't just give it to you next month.

554
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 He's going to give it to you forever.

555
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 He wants to give you eternal, everlasting, infinite joy.

556
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 Joy the likes of which you will never grow tired.

557
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 Heaven will be far happier than you dare dream.

558
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 Like we'll never grow there and get tired of the things we're doing.

559
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 It's going to be better and better and better.

560
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 Why? Because he is there with us.

561
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 And he has come down here to get us.

562
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 If you are looking for the fullness of joy, then you need to know the fullness of joy came looking for you.

563
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 And his name is Jesus.

564
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 And he is looking for some of you tonight.

565
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 Is it you?

566
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 Let me pray for you.

567
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 Father, I pray with every fiber of my being that these young adults would believe the truth that you want for their happiness,

568
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 you want for their joy, you want for their souls satisfaction more than they do.

569
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 And I pray God right now, please, that some would take you up on the invitation.

570
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 That some would be serious about the opportunity here.

571
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 Some would respond for the first time in rejoicing at a king that would come to save even the likes of them.

572
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 If you're here and you're serious about journeying into the joy of Jesus,

573
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 I'm going to boldly ask you to put your hand up.

574
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 To raise it high in declaration to God that God, I want that.

575
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 I want you. I want joy. I want Jesus.

576
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 That's what I want.

577
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 Put it up. Hold it up.

578
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 Look around.

579
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 You're not alone.

580
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 You are not by yourself.

581
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 There are others here that want the same thing you do.

582
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 Let us be a people that do not linger behind but lean all the way forward and take God up on the offer that there is deep soul satisfying delight ready for us right now.

583
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 God, we believe that is who you are, that that's what you've come to give.

584
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 And that we too can be the same.

585
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 We love you. It is in Christ's name we pray.

586
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 Amen.
