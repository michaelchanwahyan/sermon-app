 Oh, anthropology.

 When that anthro?

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,160
 Anyone know?

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,440
 I feel like the girls know.

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,800
 Welcome, Fort Worth friends.

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,160
 Welcome, Dallas friends in the room.

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,520
 We are continuing the series through Summer on the Mount,

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,920
 where we're studying the Sermon on the Mount.

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,160
 I'm going to start us in kind of a different way.

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,680
 Is anyone engaged in the room?

24
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,960
 Yeah, there we go.

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,200
 OK, a couple?

26
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,720
 No?

27
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,680
 Only like one?

28
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,320
 Anyone?

29
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:01,920
 Loud and proud.

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,400
 Let's go.

31
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,360
 Come on.

32
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,440
 Oh, man.

33
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,520
 OK, wow.

34
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,440
 Yeah.

35
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,320
 Sore subject for all the seriously dating

36
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,400
 couples who are like--

37
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,680
 [LAUGHTER]

38
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,280
 Oh, man.

39
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,120
 OK, I'm going to tell my least favorite and my favorite part

40
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,280
 of being engaged.

41
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,880
 Emily Walker, did you raise your hand?

42
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,600
 You were engaged?

43
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,680
 Yeah, let the people know.

44
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,880
 Chad, I'm helping you out.

45
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,640
 OK.

46
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,320
 My least favorite and favorite part of being engaged.

47
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,960
 So when you're engaged, you'll know what I'm talking about,

48
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,040
 because you'll be experiencing likely both these,

49
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,880
 and all of us will have that to look forward to, if we're not.

50
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,760
 When you're engaged, my least favorite part of being engaged--

51
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,640
 and it's going to sound like, why would that be your least favorite?

52
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
 And I'll explain.

53
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,320
 Was something called the shower.

54
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,600
 You know what I'm talking about?

55
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,480
 Like the showers that you would be a part of.

56
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,040
 And if you don't know what a shower is, it's not with soap and shampoo kind

57
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,560
 of shower.

58
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,200
 This was a shower that if you're engaged, you have these parties that

59
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,880
 are thrown for you, where everyone comes together,

60
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,160
 and they shower you with gifts.

61
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,640
 But the reason why this was like always my like, oh, man,

62
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,280
 this is the worst part of being engaged,

63
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,840
 was because it always felt like you're throwing a party for yourself,

64
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,480
 essentially.

65
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,120
 And you're like handing out, hey, this is what I want you to buy,

66
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,320
 and bring me to my party.

67
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,160
 And even though you're like, no, other people throw it,

68
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,860
 they throw it because they're like, yeah,

69
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,280
 I want you to throw my shower when I get engaged.

70
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,440
 So it's kind of like you're throwing it for yourself.

71
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,480
 And then the worst part-- gosh.

72
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,760
 I just like feel bad for people when they're there.

73
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,360
 So this is probably my own baggage.

74
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,040
 I'm just getting off my chest tonight.

75
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,760
 When you're at the shower, there comes this moment

76
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,720
 where everyone comes together, and you're the couple, you and your fiancee,

77
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,120
 and they're celebrating you.

78
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,120
 And you open the gifts in front of everyone.

79
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,640
 And the reason why this was like so uncomfortable, and I would be like,

80
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,020
 no, let's just-- we'll open them later.

81
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,560
 We love it.

82
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,800
 Whatever it is, you can go.

83
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,320
 We're great.

84
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,960
 Thank you so much for being here.

85
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,340
 But you have to open them, and it feels like this public display of like how

86
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,080
 much you care about me and my fiancee.

87
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,580
 Your public display about how much you care about the couple,

88
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,500
 where literally you're like, oh, open--

89
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,920
 oh, a spatula.

90
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,360
 Really?

91
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,280
 That's what we're worth to you, Mom?

92
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,960
 That's hurtful.

93
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,040
 OK.

94
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,240
 It just felt like the most uncomfortable part of the entire thing.

95
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,800
 But although my shower-- or those showers were like my least favorite--

96
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,160
 the best part of being engaged, I think, and it's kind of related to that,

97
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,160
 is something called the registry.

98
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,720
 You guys know what I'm talking about?

99
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,220
 Hala?

100
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,720
 Yeah?

101
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,840
 If you're engaged, yes?

102
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,680
 And the registry is where you get to go select anything you want from these

103
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,500
 stores that you register at, and you begin to put those things on the

104
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,460
 register for people to buy.

105
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,700
 You're telling everyone what to bring to your wedding or what

106
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,940
 to bring to your shower.

107
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,700
 And so the reason I love that was because we went, and you begin to just put down--

108
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,020
 you could put literally anything on there, and it's like a wish list for people to

109
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,460
 bring to your party, for people to get for you.

110
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,620
 And so you go around, and you show up at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, and Target,

111
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,180
 and I don't know where else you register for.

112
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,860
 And then this is even better for the guys.

113
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,060
 They give you a gun.

114
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,440
 They, like, hand you a gun, and they allow you, not like a real gun,

115
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,640
 like a laser gun.

116
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,440
 You walk around the store, and you just shoot the things that you want.

117
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,320
 It's like duck hunt.

118
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,920
 You just shoot.

119
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,040
 I'll take this, and I'll take this, and you build your registry.

120
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,800
 So the day came for me and my then-fiancÃ©, now-wife to do our registry,

121
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,360
 and we show up at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.

122
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:25,280
 And it becomes very apparent very early on that we had different perspectives on the

123
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,440
 things that we wanted to put on our registry.

124
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,740
 Like, the way even we saw what we should register for was totally different.

125
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,540
 My wife, her name is Callie.

126
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,100
 She's, like, very practical.

127
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,880
 She's like, "We need nice plates.

128
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,660
 We need cups.

129
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,420
 We need glasses.

130
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,980
 We need things for people to eat on when they come over, silverware, utensils."

131
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,820
 And I was like, "We don't need any of that stuff.

132
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,180
 We need, like, two lazy boys and a barbecue pit.

133
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,780
 Can we put the remote-control helicopter on this thing?

134
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,260
 Where's the beyond section of Bed, Bath, and Beyond?

135
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,900
 It's really Bed, Bath, and Kitchen.

136
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,500
 Can we be honest about this?

137
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,180
 That's it.

138
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,520
 There's no, like, beyond.

139
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,040
 And here's a shotgun."

140
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,160
 Because that didn't exist.

141
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,520
 And so, of course, I'm like, "No, we don't need any of that stuff."

142
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,520
 Or I would be like, "Oh, we should just get the most expensive stuff.

143
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,840
 And then if we don't like it, we'll take it back and get gift cards.

144
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,440
 We'll sell those on eBay or something."

145
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,960
 And so, and she was like, "No, very practical.

146
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,240
 We need to get the things that we need."

147
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,280
 We saw this one opportunity for this registry very different as it related to,

148
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,740
 hey, what should we get or how should we use this one opportunity to get things in this context.

149
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,020
 And the reason I start there is because tonight, we're going to continue through the story or through the sermon of Sermon on the Mount,

150
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:48,420
 where Jesus is going to say that just like in that perspective or in that circumstance where my wife and I came in with two different perspectives on how to use our registry or how to use this opportunity to get stuff, what stuff we should get.

151
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:55,340
 Just like in that perspective, and thank goodness my wife won or else we'd just have like a big screen TV and eat on paper plates.

152
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,900
 But we do have plates and things like that.

153
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:11,700
 And Jesus is going to say that as it relates to the one opportunity you have of this life and how to use money towards what to get, if you have the wrong perspective or you pursue getting the wrong things,

154
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:19,140
 it just like a husband and a wife who decide to not get plates, not get silverware, not get all those things would have a rude awakening.

155
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,780
 One day they'd look back and be like, "This remote control helicopter, who thought of that?"

156
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:38,660
 Just like in that circumstance, if you and I don't embrace and don't have the perspective God wants for us as it relates to how to use this opportunity of life to get things or as we don't have the right perspective on which things to pursue,

157
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:44,260
 it has consequences, Jesus is going to say, for this life and the next.

158
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,460
 And so really tonight we're going to explore the conversation and topic that Jesus brings up next in the Sermon on the Mount.

159
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,020
 We're going to be in Matthew chapter six, if you have a Bible you can flip open to Matthew right now.

160
00:06:53,020 --> 00:07:00,580
 Very first book of the New Testament will be in chapter six, picking up where Jesus, or where, Jesus, where JP left off last week.

161
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,340
 And Jesus as well.

162
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,820
 And we will start in verse 19.

163
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:20,500
 And we're going to explore how God calls us to see money, to see money, how to see the opportunity this life has for us, an opportunity that money gives us towards getting things.

164
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:31,380
 So we're going to specifically look at seeing from an eternal perspective, seeing with a satisfied heart, and how we see who we serve and how we spend.

165
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,060
 So let me say this one more thing before we dive in.

166
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:43,660
 When it comes to money, I don't know if you're like me, I was raised in a church and it always seemed like the church talked about money, like why does the church talk about money?

167
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,060
 Why is God broke?

168
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,060
 Why does God care about money?

169
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,060
 Why does he need money?

170
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,980
 And really, Jesus is the reason why.

171
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,780
 And tonight we're going to hear why Jesus talked about money so much.

172
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,660
 The reason church talks about it is because Jesus talks about it so much.

173
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,660
 He talks about money more than heaven and hell combined.

174
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,300
 Think about that.

175
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,220
 Like why?

176
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:10,820
 Why would Jesus, when he's on this earth, he only has so many things to talk about, decide I'm going to choose to talk about money more than heaven and hell combined.

177
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:20,780
 And tonight we're going to see that it's not because God is broke or God wants to have your money, it's because God doesn't want your money to have you.

178
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,300
 It's not that he needs your money.

179
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,020
 He just doesn't want your money to grab ahold of your heart.

180
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:31,540
 And we're going to see more specifically how it does that and why he is so passionate and talks so often about the topic of money.

181
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,900
 So we're going to start verse 19.

182
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,500
 And there we go.

183
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,020
 Do not store up for yourself.

184
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:49,420
 So Jesus addressing this hillside, this crowd of people, do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moths and vermin destroy and where thieves break in and steal.

185
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:58,220
 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moths and vermin do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal.

186
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,700
 He brings us to our first idea of seeing from an eternal perspective.

187
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,380
 How are you and I? How does God invite us to see money?

188
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,340
 The first thing Jesus says is seeing it with an eternal perspective.

189
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:23,300
 He really says, hey, as it relates to the pursuit of money in this world, as it relates to just your life and what you should spend it on acquiring more and more stuff, he says, I want you to store treasure strategically, store treasure strategically.

190
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,620
 So that really fast three times.

191
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,300
 Don't spend your life, don't spend your money investing in things in this life alone.

192
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,260
 Why? Because God hates nice stuff.

193
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,420
 He doesn't like shiny things.

194
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,260
 Is that why?

195
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,420
 Because God needs your money.

196
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,260
 He wants everyone to be broke.

197
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,820
 No, that's not what Jesus says at all.

198
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,540
 He says, look, I'm not saying that it's bad to have nice things.

199
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:51,180
 I'm just saying that as it relates to this life, if you spend all of your money and all of your time and everything you devote yourself to is getting more stuff in this life.

200
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,740
 Jesus says, look, I'm not saying that's wrong or right.

201
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,620
 I'm saying that's just a bad investment.

202
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,060
 You are storing up treasure that's only going to expire.

203
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,180
 That will not last.

204
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,460
 You're storing up things that will not endure.

205
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:13,460
 If all you do is spend money for things in this life, or you devote yourself to storing up more and more in this life, then at the end of this life, you have nothing to show for the next.

206
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:23,580
 If all you do is spend all the money that you have at the expense of investing in eternity, he would say it's just a bad investment.

207
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,380
 And he gives really a practical reason.

208
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,820
 And it's not that God hates stuff.

209
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,620
 It's just stuff breaks down like Jesus.

210
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:37,060
 Really, Dave Ramsey has become famous for this teaching of just don't invest foolishly in things in this world.

211
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,900
 Don't spend your money on things that are going to wear out.

212
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,540
 Things that break down, things that will only lose value.

213
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,180
 Like you buy a new car, it loses half of its value in the first three years.

214
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,740
 Don't invest solely in things in this world.

215
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,580
 It's a bad investment.

216
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,740
 It's going to break down.

217
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,500
 It's there's entire industries built around stuff breaking down.

218
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,780
 Anyone in like tech support here?

219
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,180
 No, like they're all in India for some reason on the phone.

220
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,980
 They that tech support industry.

221
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,380
 That's not a claim about Indians.

222
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,380
 It's just like, really, am I the only one I'm feeling judged right now?

223
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,380
 OK, OK.

224
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,140
 And rewind.

225
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:26,020
 OK, the entire tech support industry is built on job security is on the fact that stuff breaks down, stuff falls apart.

226
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,660
 So we have to have people that are on the phone.

227
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:34,340
 So if you only invest in this life, as you would see it, he's saying, I'm not saying you don't have things, don't own things.

228
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:40,060
 But if you only invest in this life, you're only going to have things that are going to fall apart that won't last.

229
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,220
 Invested in another place or there's going to be a newer model that comes out.

230
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,940
 And it's not even that stuff falls apart.

231
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,380
 It's just like a new iPhone comes out and Apple wins again and we need another one.

232
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,020
 And he says, look, there's always going to be newer.

233
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,780
 There's always going to be something breaking down.

234
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,540
 If you only invest in this life, don't store it up there.

235
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,780
 Not because it's bad, because it's a bad investment.

236
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,940
 He's saying if that's all that you invest in, but store it eternally is the second reason.

237
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:11,140
 Store it inside of eternity that he gives us really like insider information.

238
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,580
 If you're familiar with stock market.

239
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,260
 So insider information is, hey, I'm telling you something.

240
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,940
 I'm giving you inside information on what to invest in because it's a sure deal.

241
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:26,980
 Remember, Martha Stewart went to jail for S&P Martha for I don't know why I'm acting like she's dead.

242
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:34,820
 Martha Stewart went to jail for, uh, she's not, she's, she's kicking, um, uh, for insider information, stock market.

243
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,940
 So in this life, it's illegal to give insider information in heaven's perspective.

244
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,500
 God says, look, I'm inviting you now.

245
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
 Do I need your money?

246
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,900
 No, I created money.

247
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,060
 I created everything.

248
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:46,820
 I don't need your money.

249
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:53,260
 I'm giving you an opportunity to invest in something that will far outlast you to invest in a kingdom.

250
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,620
 That will be the only one that lasts in my kingdom.

251
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:01,300
 And God would say, I'm inviting you to invest in side of that.

252
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:15,500
 And another passage in scripture, he would say that anything that you give to my kingdom in terms of your time serving in terms of, uh, giving financially in terms of your life, anything that you invest, Jesus says in my kingdom, you will receive a hundred fold.

253
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,780
 You're not making a sacrifice.

254
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,060
 You're making an investment.

255
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,860
 He says that anything you and I give.

256
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:36,460
 So he says, look, when that opportunity exists, why would you spend the rest of your life trying to get more and more newer, nicer, bigger, faster, get paid an upgrade when you can invest in eternity in the safest place place for you and I to invest.

257
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:41,340
 And this is crazy and convicting is not in a 401k.

258
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,980
 It's not in real estate.

259
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,780
 It's not in a suitcase of cash underneath your bed.

260
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:55,060
 Jesus would say, he'd say, invest in my kingdom and immediately it's outside of the grasp of the turmoil of the economy around you.

261
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,620
 You are storing up treasure that will not fade and that will last forever.

262
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,220
 Don't invest solely in this world, solely in this life.

263
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,300
 How do you store up treasure?

264
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,860
 Because Jesus doesn't really answer it.

265
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,340
 Like, how do we store treasure in heaven?

266
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:23,100
 The two ways the Bible gives us, because Jesus doesn't say in this passage, is anything that you give towards God's kingdom, towards the expanding of his kingdom, your time serving or your money.

267
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,900
 That's the first way.

268
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:34,580
 Anything that you give towards the expanding of God's kingdom, a church, a missionary, an organization that is trying to expand the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ to people who need to hear it.

269
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:40,220
 Anything you give in that way, serving or money, you'll receive a hundredfold in the life to come.

270
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:45,820
 And the second way he says that we store up treasure is by giving it to the poor, by giving it to the poor.

271
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,860
 Like, this is the most common answer Jesus gives.

272
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,500
 He's never like, hey, give me your money.

273
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,580
 Just hand it over right now.

274
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,420
 Give me the wallet.

275
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,940
 He says, look, give your money away.

276
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,420
 Give it to the poor.

277
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,140
 And in doing so, you'll have treasure in heaven.

278
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,860
 How much?

279
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,980
 The Bible doesn't say.

280
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,460
 Is it 10%, 20%, 1%?

281
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,180
 Is it God just giving you a tax?

282
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:12,140
 No, it doesn't say because God's saying, look, I don't want to just give you a number and check the box and you can move on.

283
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,900
 I want your heart.

284
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,380
 That's what I'm after.

285
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,020
 I'm a God who works inside out.

286
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,620
 I'm after your heart, not just giving you some percentage to cut off.

287
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,260
 So how much?

288
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,180
 He says it doesn't answer, but give generously, give radically.

289
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,260
 And Jesus would say, and you're storing up treasure in heaven.

290
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:37,340
 I think where I get like caught on this is I'm like, I don't have treasure.

291
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,220
 Who has treasure?

292
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,540
 That's like went away with the pirates.

293
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,660
 I'm not rich.

294
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,900
 Who is rich?

295
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,740
 Or I know a lot of rich people, but I'm not one of them.

296
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:58,380
 And I think Jesus would say to you and to me, if he's telling his audience this and his audience that is hearing this for the very first time lives at a level of poverty that most of us will hardly ever be able to even imagine.

297
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:07,740
 Like give us our day when Jesus gave this original message, you speaking to this hillside of men and women who lived at a poverty level, unlike anything we have in this country, they live that.

298
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,180
 Give us our day, our daily bread.

299
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,020
 That was literal.

300
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,380
 They waited in bread lines.

301
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:18,220
 And Jesus tells them the poorest of the poor don't store up treasure here.

302
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:27,060
 And you and I, who are rich in a way that his audience could barely even be able to understand you have food like for more than one day.

303
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,020
 He would say, you guys are rich.

304
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,620
 Don't waste your life trying to build more and more in this life.

305
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,500
 Invest it.

306
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:43,140
 In the life to come, I mean, for the sake of illustration on being rich, like is anyone anyone going to movie in the past month, even 30 days?

307
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,380
 OK, you guys are loaded.

308
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,740
 All right, anybody, anyone drive here tonight?

309
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,460
 Anyone own a car?

310
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,500
 Let's go car.

311
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,420
 OK, all right.

312
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,860
 Some of you guys took the bus.

313
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,260
 I'm sure you guys are loaded as well.

314
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,380
 Anyone have a phone?

315
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,260
 Anyone have a phone?

316
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,300
 Anyone have a cell phone?

317
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,020
 No.

318
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,620
 Oh, my gosh.

319
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,980
 You guys are in the dark age right now.

320
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,020
 I feel bad.

321
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,380
 Phone.

322
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,620
 If you have a phone, you're loaded.

323
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,660
 You have an iPhone.

324
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,420
 Oh, my gosh.

325
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,140
 You are so loaded.

326
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,420
 Anyone have an Android?

327
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,060
 OK, you are confused.

328
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,620
 I'm kidding.

329
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,140
 I'm kidding.

330
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,020
 Androids are great.

331
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,660
 I think our insurance on a phone like we live at a level of insurance.

332
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,140
 People have insurance.

333
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,180
 I have insurance on my phone.

334
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,420
 Most people don't have life insurance.

335
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,380
 I'm like, I got so much.

336
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,300
 I'll insure the phone.

337
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,180
 Why not?

338
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,060
 We have so much.

339
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,700
 If you make $32,000 a year, you're in the top 1% of the world.

340
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,860
 Jesus would say, you are rich.

341
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,860
 And don't be fooled.

342
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,300
 Don't buy into the lie of culture around you on getting richer and richer.

343
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:40,300
 At the exclusion of investing in the only kingdom that will last,

344
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,620
 gods, don't spend your life storing up treasure here

345
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,060
 at the exclusion of investing it where it will last.

346
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,020
 I'm not trying to make you feel guilty, Jesus would say.

347
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,900
 I'm trying to move you towards generosity.

348
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,140
 I don't want you to feel guilty.

349
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,980
 Everything that you have is a gift from God.

350
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,460
 I'm trying to move you in the direction of being generous,

351
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,380
 towards investing in eternity, seeing with an eternal perspective.

352
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,060
 First idea of how to see our money.

353
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,980
 That's not all.

354
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,100
 Jesus keeps going and really tells us the answer behind why God goes

355
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,500
 heart of the whole on money.

356
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,340
 Verse 21.

357
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,020
 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

358
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,540
 The eye is the lamp of the body.

359
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,340
 If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light.

360
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:30,140
 But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness.

361
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:36,060
 If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness?

362
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,780
 Brings to the second idea of seeing how to see our money,

363
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,380
 seeing with a satisfied heart.

364
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,580
 Seeing with a satisfied heart.

365
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,980
 How do you see your money, time, all that you have,

366
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,300
 and how do you use it for God's kingdom?

367
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,540
 See with a satisfied heart.

368
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,340
 Why does God care so much about money?

369
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,740
 He just gave us the answer.

370
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,780
 God speaks on money 2,000 times in the Bible.

371
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,380
 There's 500 on prayer, to give it in perspective.

372
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,780
 2,000 times, 15% of everything Jesus said is on money,

373
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,700
 and he just said why.

374
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,820
 This is why God says, "I go heart of the whole."

375
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,060
 Because money and the way you spend does not just reflect

376
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,460
 the way your eternity is going to be.

377
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,620
 In other words, there's a direct connection, he just said,

378
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,700
 between how you invest in this life and your eternity awaiting you,

379
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,380
 but it also reflects where your heart is, what has your heart,

380
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,100
 and unlike anything else, I mean, this is so crazy.

381
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,180
 Jesus just said, "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be."

382
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,060
 The number one competitor for your heart is money.

383
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,580
 It's not sex, it's not alcohol, it's not porn, it's not a relationship,

384
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,780
 it's money.

385
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,060
 That's why God says, "I'm going after your heart."

386
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,500
 Because your heart, unlike anything else, not even the devil

387
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,620
 is not the number one competitor for your heart.

388
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:54,140
 Money, because money creates this illusion of control inside of your heart

389
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,900
 that if I can just have more and I can just have more, and God says,

390
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,900
 "Look, I'm going after your heart, that's why I care about your money.

391
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,820
 I don't want to have your money.

392
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,820
 I don't want your money to have you.

393
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,940
 I don't want you to be a slave to having more and more and more.

394
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,060
 It will never be enough.

395
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,140
 I don't want your stuff.

396
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,180
 I don't care about your stuff.

397
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,100
 I'm God.

398
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,340
 What would I do with your Escalade?

399
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,460
 I don't care about that.

400
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,220
 I don't want your Escalade to have you.

401
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,900
 That's why I care about money," he says.

402
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:28,620
 Because just like your money is a direct, how you spend reflects who has your heart.

403
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,860
 And he says, "That's why I talk about money so much because I know unlike

404
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:38,580
 anything else, money is going to fight and compete to take your heart.

405
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,900
 And I want your heart.

406
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,300
 I'm a God who's all about the heart."

407
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,940
 That's the entire Sermon of the Mount essentially is all about Jesus saying

408
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,340
 it's about your heart, not your hands.

409
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,820
 And then he brings up what seems like kind of a random subject on the eye.

410
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,860
 It's like store treasures in heaven, eternity.

411
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,900
 And while we're on the subject, let's talk about the eye.

412
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,980
 It's like, "We weren't on that subject, Jesus."

413
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,580
 All right, so the eye, and he says, "The eye is the lamp of the body."

414
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,780
 The eye is the eye.

415
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,340
 Thank you.

416
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,780
 Thanks, mom.

417
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,740
 The eye is the lamp of the body.

418
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,900
 He uses an illustration to say basically that just like in this culture,

419
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,180
 because there wasn't electricity, there weren't those things, anytime you had a

420
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,580
 lamp, you would walk behind a lamp.

421
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,220
 In the midst of darkness, you follow a lamp.

422
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,260
 That's how things got lit up.

423
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,860
 And he says, "Just like a lamp that is lit, everything moves in its direction,

424
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,980
 your eye, your vision, or your perspective on this world.

425
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,100
 In the same way, everything is shaped.

426
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,740
 The rest of your life will move in the direction of how you see the world

427
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,740
 around you.

428
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:40,700
 How you see money will determine the entire course of the way your life moves."

429
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,340
 And he says, "Look, if you have a healthy or a good you may have in their eye,

430
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,900
 you have a good perspective on life, that this world is just a vapor.

431
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,900
 It's disappearing.

432
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,060
 It's an opportunity.

433
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,020
 Every dollar and every moment is an opportunity to invest in eternity or one

434
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,340
 that I will lose forever.

435
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,580
 If you have that perspective," he says, "your whole life, the way that you work,

436
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,460
 the way that you see buying purchases, the way that you have relationships,

437
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,340
 the number of hours you work at your job, everything will move in that direction.

438
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:13,220
 But if you have an unhealthy or bad perspective," which is what he says,

439
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,940
 "everything will move in the opposite direction.

440
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,740
 If that's off, if your vision of this life, if your vision of money is off,

441
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,780
 it impacts way more than money.

442
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,740
 It'll impact your anxiety levels.

443
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,940
 It'll impact the things that you focus on, your attention span,

444
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:32,220
 on a half to have the next Tory Burch purse, the next car, newer upgrade,

445
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,300
 newer whatever it is.

446
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,860
 Everything moves in that, that there's way more at stake than money."

447
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,900
 And Jesus says, "Look, if your perspective is off, it's going

448
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,180
 to affect everything.

449
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,380
 It's not just about money."

450
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,500
 And God who loves you and cares about the course of your life is saying, "Look,

451
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,820
 don't get swept up in the current of culture around you that's saying,

452
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,860
 'Buy more, have more, get more debt, spend more money, buy more,

453
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,220
 buy newer things.'

454
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,460
 Don't allow that flawed perspective to influence your vision,

455
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,300
 but see this life for what it is.

456
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,260
 See it clearly.

457
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,980
 There's much more at stake than just your vision or just money even."

458
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,100
 Paul would say this later and he's writing to Timothy and he says this about people

459
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:20,780
 who want to be rich or want to have more, nicer, newer, more and more,

460
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,540
 which is all of us.

461
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,580
 I mean, that's the weird thing about money is it's like intoxicating.

462
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,340
 You want more of it.

463
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,900
 He says this in 1 Timothy, he writes to Timothy and he addresses people

464
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,180
 who want to get rich, verse 9 of chapter 6.

465
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:42,300
 "Those who want to get rich or richer fall into temptation and a trap and into many

466
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:47,860
 foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.

467
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:54,300
 For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.

468
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,660
 Some people eager for money have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves

469
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,780
 with many griefs."

470
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:05,540
 So Paul writes later and says, "Look, it's not just this life even alone that's

471
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,380
 at stake.

472
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,020
 If you have a wrong view or you're always...

473
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,460
 Your view is, 'I need to get more.

474
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,020
 I need to get paid, upgrade, get mine, take care of me, myself, and I.

475
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,620
 I need more dollars in my bank account.

476
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,140
 I need a newer purse, newer watch, that next thing.'

477
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,780
 If that's your perspective and you do so at the exclusion of investing

478
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,780
 in eternity, Paul says, 'It will never be enough.'

479
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,300
 And Timothy, I'm writing you and here's what I want you to tell those rich people.

480
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,220
 'I've seen this firsthand,' is what he says, 'that the desire for money has not

481
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,660
 just impacted their relationships, their marriage.

482
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,500
 I've even seen it, Timothy, erode their faith.

483
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,420
 Some men and women who used to be among us, they used to be brothers,

484
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,620
 they didn't allow...

485
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,340
 They couldn't control the appetite for money and they walked away

486
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,700
 from their faith.

487
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,780
 They walked away from the God who is there and worship the God of money."

488
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:59,100
 He says, "If you don't surrender that to Christ, and I don't, that desire for more

489
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:05,820
 and more and nicer and newer, bigger, not only impacts all of life,

490
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:10,380
 but it even impacts your faith or erodes your faith."

491
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,620
 And I think it's...

492
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,420
 What I love about that passage is it answers a couple of things.

493
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,420
 Is it a sin to be rich?

494
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,420
 No.

495
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:23,300
 Is it a sin to want to be rich?

496
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,660
 Not if you want to give it all away.

497
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,020
 And I hear this often from friends in business world, I think this is great,

498
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,860
 I think, where they'll be like, "Yeah, I want to go in, I want to make a lot

499
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,460
 of money, and I'm going to give it all away."

500
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,700
 And the funny thing about that scenario, and I'm sure that's everyone here who's

501
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:45,100
 like, "I want to make a lot of money to give it all away," is if that's you,

502
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,940
 you want to be poor.

503
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,900
 You ever think about that?

504
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,100
 Like, if you're like, "Yeah, I just want to make a lot of money to give it all

505
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,580
 away," I mean, you want to be poor, why not just cut out the middleman and boom,

506
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,460
 voila, you're there, you don't have to make anything.

507
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:57,980
 Think about it.

508
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,740
 I mean, most people when they say they're like, "Yeah, I want to make a lot and I

509
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,740
 want to, you know, give it all away," they really mean, "I want to be wealthy

510
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,060
 and have a boat that I can lend out to people in ministry.

511
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,780
 That's what I want to do."

512
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,820
 That's what they're just saying.

513
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,300
 That's great.

514
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,860
 You got a boat, we'll take it.

515
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,980
 But...

516
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,980
 So what is wrong with me?

517
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,100
 So many things.

518
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,740
 But it's true.

519
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,820
 And if you want to be rich to give it all away, you want to be poor.

520
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,860
 Voila, you're there.

521
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,540
 And Paul says, "Look, is it a sin to want to be rich?

522
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:29,940
 I don't know.

523
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,580
 It's at least dangerous," he says.

524
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,780
 Don't allow the appetite for more and more and more to get a hold of your heart,

525
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,980
 to direct the course of your life.

526
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:50,260
 I, like, feel this every day like you do in Dallas, where we just live in such

527
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:56,820
 materialism that I know it's impacting the house I want to live in, the car I want

528
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,220
 to drive, the money and the way I want to use money, my desire for it.

529
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:09,020
 Like, when I came to Watermark six or seven years ago, I remember I was making

530
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,020
 $10,000 a year.

531
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,660
 So I came right out of college, I'm getting $10,000, don't be jealous.

532
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,580
 And I remember getting that phone call and I was like, "Yes, absolutely, $10,000.

533
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,220
 That's amazing."

534
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,580
 Getting off the phone and be like, "Oh, my gosh, what am I going to do with all

535
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,420
 that money?

536
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,460
 How are they going to give it to me?

537
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,900
 Like, in a suitcase of cash?"

538
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,380
 I'm thinking like blank check.

539
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,300
 I'm on, like, the mattress just doing "Snow Angels" and money and "LeBron."

540
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,420
 And I'm like, "Oh, my gosh, this is going to be unbelievable.

541
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,860
 That's so much money."

542
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:42,300
 And now, fast forward, I make over four times that and still not enough.

543
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:48,860
 I feel like the current of culture pulling me, "You need more, more, more."

544
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:58,020
 And the times that I honestly, often, there are times I want to leave ministry.

545
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:03,860
 And it's not because pastoral care conversations are hard and they are

546
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,180
 heavy.

547
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,180
 It's not because, "Oh, yeah, you got to work on Sunday, even during football

548
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:08,900
 season."

549
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,780
 It's not because that either.

550
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:19,300
 It's money because I want more money.

551
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:25,860
 And it's like even in this text, Jesus says, "David, don't buy into the lie

552
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,740
 that the world around you is selling you.

553
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,580
 Don't buy into it.

554
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,460
 Don't forfeit and give up and walk away from ministry after the love of money."

555
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,340
 I'm not saying everyone should be in ministry.

556
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:41,740
 I'm saying in that scenario, it's easy for my heart to convince me I need more of it

557
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,740
 and to begin to walk away.

558
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:47,180
 And Jesus, through these pages to me this week, just whispered, "Don't leave it for

559
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,020
 more money.

560
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,340
 It will never be enough.

561
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,620
 If you begin walking down that road, you'll never have enough.

562
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,980
 The more you get, the more you want.

563
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,380
 There will never be enough.

564
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:00,620
 But I will always be, David.

565
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,860
 I will be.

566
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,860
 Will you surrender to me?

567
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,740
 Will you trust me?

568
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,900
 Will you invest in my kingdom?

569
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:12,100
 Don't buy into the lie that everywhere in Dallas is being sold.

570
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:17,420
 Every advertisement, every...just all around us is being sold.

571
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,180
 Don't fall for it.

572
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,940
 Don't allow your life to move in that direction.

573
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,460
 See with satisfied eyes.

574
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:31,140
 And he finishes off verse 24 and really gives us an indication on how we can see who we

575
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,140
 serve.

576
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,900
 He says this, "No one can serve two masters.

577
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:41,300
 Either you will hate one and love the other, or you will be devoted to one and despise

578
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,740
 the other.

579
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,980
 You cannot serve both God and money.

580
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,780
 You will either be a servant of God."

581
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,780
 Even that's radical.

582
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,780
 It's like, "Really?

583
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,780
 I feel like I can.

584
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,260
 God and the devil, maybe.

585
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,260
 But God and money?

586
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,820
 Can't we just prioritize them?"

587
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,580
 And he says, "No, no, no.

588
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,900
 You cannot serve them both.

589
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:05,980
 You will either be a servant of God or you'll be a servant of money or a slave to money."

590
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,980
 Which is it going to be?

591
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,380
 You'll either serve one or serve the other.

592
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,300
 You cannot have both.

593
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:15,780
 Seeing who you serve and you really can see who you serve by how you spend.

594
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,100
 Like how you use your money tells you, "Who am I a servant of?

595
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,400
 How am I using this money?"

596
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,140
 Like in my registry, remember when I was registering?

597
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:31,860
 And in that registry, I had to decide, "Am I going to choose to serve me or to serve

598
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,860
 my wife?

599
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,260
 Like I can't have both.

600
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,580
 We're either going to get the plates or the helicopter.

601
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,580
 What are we going to do?"

602
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,740
 And I had to choose which one to serve.

603
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,740
 And you can't have both.

604
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,020
 Jesus says, "You cannot serve.

605
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,180
 You cannot be a servant of God and money.

606
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:51,500
 Ultimately, you'll either serve God and you'll see money as something to use to serve him,

607
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
 to serve the master.

608
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
 It's his money.

609
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,300
 I'm going to use it to serve him or you'll be a slave of money.

610
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,020
 And you'll see money is just something you can do whatever you want with and serve however

611
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,020
 you want."

612
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,700
 But God says, "You cannot be neutral on this.

613
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,940
 You cannot serve both money and me.

614
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:14,460
 You're going to have to choose."

615
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,520
 I think what's crazy about money is like you can move in the direction of serving money

616
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,040
 without even realizing it.

617
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,300
 I think about even things we own, like anything that you can't give away, you don't own.

618
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,620
 It owns you.

619
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,700
 Like you've moving already in that direction where you're like, you no longer own it or

620
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,400
 else you could decide what to do with it.

621
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
 It owns you.

622
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,460
 And God says, "Look, I'm inviting you to have freedom.

623
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,540
 Be a servant of me.

624
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:42,660
 Allow me to be the master over your finances or you'll be a slave and servant to money."

625
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:46,800
 When the Bible presents this really two ideas of are you going to be a servant of God or

626
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,460
 how do I know if I'm a servant of money?

627
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,740
 Like how can I really see that?

628
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,580
 It presents this broad teaching within the Bible of two categories of people as it relates

629
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,100
 to their money.

630
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,260
 And the first one that's a servant of God sees everything that they have, every dollar,

631
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:05,400
 every moment, everything that they do as they are a steward of.

632
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
 It's not theirs.

633
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
 It's on loan.

634
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,380
 The Bible teaches Psalm 24, "The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof."

635
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,980
 Everything you have is right now on loan.

636
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,720
 God says, "How are you going to steward it?"

637
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,100
 So the first person, servant of God, sees himself as a steward.

638
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,380
 The second person sees himself as an owner.

639
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,660
 I do whatever I want with it.

640
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,220
 As it relates to spending, how do these two break down?

641
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,860
 The owner says, "Do I have it in the bank?

642
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,860
 Yeah, done.

643
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,220
 Or I'll get a credit card and I'll buy it on credit."

644
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,580
 A steward says, "God, would you have me buy this?"

645
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,020
 As it relates to savings, an owner says, "Yeah, I'm going to save and save.

646
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,460
 If there's a depression or recession, I want to have a nest egg.

647
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,460
 I want to have backup.

648
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,660
 I'm going to save as much as I can."

649
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,820
 And a steward says, "God, I don't want to put my trust.

650
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,940
 I don't want to find security in the numbers in a bank account.

651
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,300
 That's foolish.

652
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,260
 How much would you have me save here?

653
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,100
 What would be wise?"

654
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,780
 As it relates to giving, how does an owner and a steward break down?

655
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,740
 An owner says, "God, how much do you want me to give?

656
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,740
 What's the number?

657
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,740
 Just tell me it."

658
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,380
 And a steward says, "God, how much do you want me to keep?

659
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,380
 It's all yours.

660
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,500
 I want to be wise in the way that I steward it.

661
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,580
 How do you see your money right now, everything that you have and I have?"

662
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,580
 So convicting.

663
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,880
 God says, "You are the steward of.

664
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,980
 You make a million dollars or you make $5,000.

665
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:36,980
 You're going to give an account for how you stewarded every single penny, every dollar.

666
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:45,020
 How do you see yourself, an owner or a steward, a servant of God or a servant of money?"

667
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:53,260
 As I look at just the application for me of just this text, it's like, whose kingdom am

668
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,620
 I building?

669
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,100
 Whose kingdom am I going to invest in?

670
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,740
 I've only got so many days, so many dollars, so many moments.

671
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,220
 Whose kingdom am I going to give to?

672
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,940
 And whose kingdom are you building into?

673
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,980
 Whose kingdom are you investing in?

674
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:12,260
 Specifically as it relates to your time, who are you giving your time to?

675
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,420
 Are you serving somewhere?

676
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,340
 Are you building into God's kingdom?

677
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,380
 Your kingdom won't last.

678
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,940
 My kingdom will not last.

679
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,240
 As it relates to your time, whose kingdom are you building?

680
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,980
 If you're working like a 90-hour job, like some of you, honestly, you should quit your

681
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,520
 job.

682
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:34,740
 Most of you shouldn't, and you should be there on mission, and that's a ministry for you.

683
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,700
 Some of you, after just working in years with young adults, they come down front and they're

684
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,780
 like, "Yeah, I would serve.

685
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,780
 I would do this.

686
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,700
 I just work 90 hours a week right now.

687
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,700
 I'm in iBanking.

688
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,220
 I don't have time to serve."

689
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:52,180
 And Jesus would say, "You don't have time not to.

690
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,180
 Whose kingdom?

691
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,180
 I'll do it someday.

692
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,220
 You don't know how many days you have.

693
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,820
 Whose kingdom are you going to give your life to?"

694
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,580
 Before you come down and you're like, "Yeah, I think I should quit my job," I'm not saying

695
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,580
 most of you shouldn't.

696
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,340
 We need people in the marketplace.

697
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:09,660
 We need people in every arena, honestly, who love Jesus and do a good job.

698
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,300
 But whose kingdom are you going to give your life to?

699
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,980
 How are you going to spend?

700
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:19,180
 Whose kingdom financially are you going to give your life to?

701
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,020
 And I get insecure, honestly, as a pastor.

702
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,660
 And I know my community is helping me work on it.

703
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,660
 My wife's a counselor.

704
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,340
 We're working through it because I'm insecure.

705
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,980
 But just talking about money on a stage, it's like, "Yeah, give us your money.

706
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,260
 Put it in here."

707
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,860
 And I just want to take that off in case you have sensitive baggage like me where it's

708
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,300
 like, "Oh, the church wants my money."

709
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,660
 We don't want your money.

710
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,180
 We've never taken an offering here.

711
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,940
 Not one time at the porch.

712
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,300
 We've only actually given out money once, maybe twice that I know of.

713
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,300
 We don't want your money.

714
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,300
 And so what I want to do is remove that.

715
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,500
 If you're going, "Look, I don't want to give it.

716
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,780
 I'm not going to give it to the church."

717
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,400
 Give it to some missionary.

718
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,920
 Give it to some organization that's living on mission.

719
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,460
 Give it to building up the kingdom.

720
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,820
 Let me take that excuse off the table.

721
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,820
 But whose kingdom are you going to give to?

722
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,820
 Yours or the only one that will last?

723
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,020
 The only one that all of us someday we're going to look back on and see the only one

724
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,060
 that ever mattered.

725
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,380
 Whose kingdom are you going to invest in?

726
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,540
 If you're going, "I don't have enough money."

727
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:20,900
 You may need to do a budget because at the end of the month, it just kind of disappears.

728
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:27,200
 If you're not intentional to invest it, Jesus says, "Invest it now or someday you'll look

729
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,660
 back and only wish I had done more.

730
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,980
 I know that's how I will."

731
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:39,020
 How we spend not only shows who we serve, it shows who we treasure.

732
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:43,660
 How you give shows who you treasure.

733
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,820
 Like for me, how I give, how I spend, is it me?

734
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,820
 Is it my comfort?

735
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,820
 Is it that?

736
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,820
 Or is it Jesus?

737
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,620
 Does the way that I live model that he's the ultimate treasure of my life?

738
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:58,940
 How I spend and how you give not only shows who you serve, but who you treasure ultimately

739
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,300
 in this life.

740
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,420
 The ultimate treasure is not a bunch of things.

741
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,540
 It is a person, Jesus.

742
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:17,340
 Just like in that registry where we registered and we got all the gifts and we got married.

743
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,660
 And we went to the house and got all the gifts open and it was awesome.

744
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,660
 People were really generous.

745
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:29,060
 We got spatulas and all the egg poacher and all the exciting stuff.

746
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:33,420
 In that case, the ultimate treasure though, it wasn't, and this goes without saying, it

747
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,700
 wasn't the toaster.

748
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,660
 It was my wife, Callie.

749
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,300
 That's the treasure of getting married.

750
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,020
 If you get married because you're like, "I need a new toaster or blender.

751
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,380
 Who wants to get married?"

752
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,940
 That'd be a bad idea.

753
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,340
 The ultimate treasure in that case, in that scenario, it's not a bunch of things.

754
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,340
 It's a person.

755
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,540
 In that case, my wife.

756
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:56,400
 And the ultimate treasure in this life is not a bunch of things.

757
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,460
 It's a person named Jesus.

758
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,140
 Like the ultimate treasure for all of the ages in every single life, he is the treasure.

759
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,540
 The treasure of the ages is Jesus.

760
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,620
 It's not a bunch of things.

761
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,620
 It's a person.

762
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:14,220
 And how you spend showcases that in my life, the ultimate treasure is Jesus.

763
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,740
 He's the treasure of all existence.

764
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,940
 And one day we're going to see that clearly.

765
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,060
 And just like a husband, in that case, if I got married and I was, or I did get married

766
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,860
 and I was sitting out there and I'm like, "Oh my gosh, this stuff is amazing."

767
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,660
 And I allowed the toaster and the blender to distract me from the ultimate treasure,

768
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,420
 which was my wife.

769
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,940
 You'd look at it and be like, "You're crazy."

770
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,780
 If she wanted to go to bed and I was like, "No, I'm going to play with the popcorn maker

771
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,780
 a little bit more."

772
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,780
 You'd be like, "What is wrong with you?

773
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,780
 Guilt-free sex.

774
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,780
 You can have it.

775
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,780
 You're married."

776
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,780
 It's not good.

777
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,020
 It's a single scrap.

778
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,020
 It's true.

779
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,020
 Put a ring on it.

780
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,020
 Okay?

781
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,020
 Okay.

782
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,020
 Man, I'm killing a moment.

783
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:59,220
 Spiritual music beyond and everything.

784
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,260
 Just like in that scenario where if I was like, "No, you go to bed.

785
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,220
 I'm going to sit out here and play with the toaster."

786
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,660
 You'd be like, "What is wrong with you?

787
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,820
 You're getting distracted from the ultimate treasure."

788
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:13,020
 When some of us look back in this life, and when the day comes where we see it clearly

789
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,940
 from heaven's perspective, just like a husband looks foolish playing with the blender while

790
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,660
 his wife, he wants to spend time with his wife or his wife wants to spend time with

791
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,460
 him, he's distracted from the ultimate treasure.

792
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:28,100
 It will look that way for us who allow stuff in this life, our bank account to distract

793
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,660
 us from the ultimate treasure.

794
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,740
 Who's the ultimate treasure?

795
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,340
 Jesus.

796
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:38,380
 The treasure of all eternity, the treasure of this life, the treasure of existence.

797
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,780
 Like even in the life to come, have you ever thought about this?

798
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,220
 And I'll close right here.

799
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,460
 In the life to come, the treasure in heaven is not a bunch of things.

800
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,580
 It's Jesus.

801
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:52,220
 Like John in Revelation 21, he describes heaven and you should go read it tonight.

802
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,740
 John is given this vision of heaven where Jesus basically appears and shows him what

803
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,740
 heaven is like.

804
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:03,540
 And John describes it and he says all these different things that we value in this life.

805
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:08,460
 He speaks of gold and sapphire and diamonds and emeralds and jasper.

806
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:14,780
 But he says like all the things you value when you get to heaven, gold is like asphalt.

807
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,300
 Skywall is emeralds.

808
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,220
 The foundation of things is pearls.

809
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,500
 It's like everything in the next life that you and I value.

810
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,220
 It's as though God is sending us a message.

811
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,800
 You'd be like all the walls being made out of Louis Vuitton purses.

812
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,100
 It's God sending a message saying everything that you value, even in the life to come,

813
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,460
 all the things you think are treasure, all of them one day you'll see as they're all

814
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:40,000
 pushed aside to make way for the clearest treasure, Jesus.

815
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,140
 And one day you're going to see it.

816
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,740
 And one day I'm going to see it.

817
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,900
 And let me close here.

818
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:53,580
 My fear for this room and my fear from my heart, honestly, is that I'm going to allow

819
00:40:53,580 --> 00:41:01,700
 things a bigger house, more of my 401k to distract me from the ultimate treasure, which

820
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,700
 is Jesus.

821
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:09,180
 And I don't want you to spend the rest of your life chasing little green pieces of paper

822
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,700
 with dead presidents on it.

823
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,340
 That's what it is.

824
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,660
 Spending your time, spending your money, spending all those things, getting more and more stuff.

825
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,860
 I mean, what are we going to do if God gives us 40 years, 50 years, really?

826
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:25,340
 Are we going to just spend it trying to get a bigger house, a newer car, a nicer model?

827
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,220
 Are we going to spend it?

828
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,520
 And God, I hope this is true of my life.

829
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,500
 When my time comes and I look back, I want to use my life to show other people the ultimate

830
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,500
 treasure, which is Jesus.

831
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,640
 I want to use everything that I have, every dollar that I have.

832
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,100
 And I like shiny things and I like nice things.

833
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,500
 God, will you help me in your grace?

834
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:50,380
 Will you help us in your grace to not get distracted by the things of this world, but

835
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,780
 to showcase and show others the ultimate treasure, which is Jesus.

836
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,060
 And right now, as you leave and you think on your life, whose kingdom are you going

837
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,060
 to build?

838
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:06,900
 What are we going to do with the rest of your life?

839
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:14,580
 If you heard tonight me say, give the church your money, that would make me really sad.

840
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:19,500
 I'm saying, give your life to Jesus.

841
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:27,500
 Building the only kingdom that will ever last, showcasing the treasure of all life, all existence.

842
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:32,120
 And one day we're going to see it when our time comes and your time comes.

843
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:37,200
 And we'll look back and the question of whose kingdom did I build?

844
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,720
 Whose kingdom did I invest in will either be answered mine.

845
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,600
 And I wasted it.

846
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,480
 I wasted the opportunity or yours.

847
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,240
 I wish I would have done more, but I built yours.

848
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,160
 And he's inviting us now to build in the only kingdom that matters.

849
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,160
 The only one that will last.

850
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,160
 I'm going to pray that we do that.

851
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,160
 God, would you help us?

852
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
 Would you help me?

853
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:09,600
 I'm so allured by just the next thing, nicer things.

854
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,440
 I'm so discontent often.

855
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:18,540
 Would you in your grace help me help all of us in the room who know you?

856
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,600
 Our spirit is willing often, but our flesh is so weak.

857
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,220
 So will you help us?

858
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,520
 Would we be a generation that gives our life away?

859
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:33,800
 God, would you at the end of my life, I want to be someone who showed the ultimate treasure

860
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,800
 was Jesus.

861
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,280
 It will always be you in this life and the next.

862
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,280
 Out of all that we could say or do, would that be said of us?

863
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,280
 We love you.
