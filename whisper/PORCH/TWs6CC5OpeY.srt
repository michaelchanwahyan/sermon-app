1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 (audience cheering)

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:26,560
 I never really know what to wear to these things.

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,660
 (audience laughing)

4
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,000
 You know, it can feel kind of like a fashion show,

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,400
 if you will.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,580
 And so yeah, man.

7
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,500
 Anybody know what this is?

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,540
 (audience shouting)

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,740
 A gi.

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,400
 It's not a karate gi.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,860
 (audience shouting)

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,680
 Jiu-jitsu.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,320
 It's a jiu-jitsu gi.

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,720
 That's right.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,560
 It's not a flex, right?

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,400
 'Cause I'm a white belt, I'm no good, you know?

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,920
 Let me just tell you that up front, right?

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,280
 Anybody into BJJ, that's kind of your thing?

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,240
 They call it rolling, you know, you roll,

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,040
 that's like wrestling, that's like mixed martial arts,

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,880
 you're on the ground.

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,440
 Brazilian jiu-jitsu is really wrestling.

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,960
 Anybody, any practitioner, like,

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,160
 they got a higher belt, you got a white belt?

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,480
 (audience shouting)

26
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,320
 Right there?

27
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,140
 What is it?

28
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,760
 Purple belt, come on, man, come on.

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,760
 (audience cheering)

30
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,920
 (audience applauding)

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:35,800
 I just gotta ask you some questions, right?

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,000
 So, no, no, stay here, stay here.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,960
 No, no, I'm serious, oh yeah.

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,360
 We're gonna do this.

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,000
 I know you didn't know that, but it's gonna be awesome.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,900
 But like, so just because they don't know anything

37
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,320
 about it, maybe, so like, if, when I want to be done,

38
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,160
 right, what do I gotta do?

39
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,000
 - Tap out.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,040
 - Tap out, so just like.

41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,800
 - No, like, you can't be done just right now.

42
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,640
 - Okay.

43
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,760
 - Like, I gotta get you in something

44
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,880
 and then you gotta tap out.

45
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,200
 - But, but if, if.

46
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,680
 (audience laughing)

47
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,480
 He said, he said, I gotta get you in something,

48
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,520
 then you gotta tap out.

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,520
 I'm like, I don't know, man.

50
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,960
 Even, even the accent's intimidating me, I'll be honest.

51
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,400
 Okay, but, but hold on, so, so if I tap out,

52
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,320
 you're gonna stop?

53
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,160
 - Yeah.

54
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,200
 - Okay, at any time?

55
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,040
 - I got you.

56
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,560
 - Like, I can tap out at any time and you stop?

57
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,680
 - Even right now, if you go like that.

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,280
 - You gotta stop, okay.

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,120
 And so I can tap out on me, on the ground?

60
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,520
 - No, you gotta touch the person.

61
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,000
 - I gotta touch the person, okay, okay.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,360
 And so you give me your word, when I tap out,

63
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,200
 you're gonna stop?

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,020
 - Yeah.

65
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,860
 - Okay, you promise?

66
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,700
 - Yeah.

67
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,520
 - You promise, promise?

68
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,360
 - Yes, sir.

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,200
 - Okay, 'cause I know you're probably like,

70
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,360
 there's some lady here I gotta show, you know,

71
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,640
 I know, I see you, man.

72
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,280
 Okay, okay, no, no, no.

73
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,640
 So let's, yeah, no, yeah, but I might be bigger,

74
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,960
 you're a purple belt, I'm a white belt, okay?

75
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,680
 All right, okay, okay.

76
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,080
 So, so let's just, so when I tap out,

77
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,680
 you're gonna stop, you promise?

78
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,000
 Okay, so let's just go real slow, okay?

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,520
 Okay, ready?

80
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,360
 Let's go.

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,000
 (audience laughing)

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,520
 You're a purple belt, like, why do I want to roll with you?

83
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,480
 You know what I mean?

84
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,180
 You're a purple belt, all right?

85
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,960
 Hey, thank you, thank you for coming up, man.

86
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,400
 (audience cheering)

87
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,520
 Yeah, yeah.

88
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,480
 It's like, why, like, why am I gonna do that, you know?

89
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,720
 Like, so one time I'm here in Dallas

90
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,880
 and I'm training BJJ, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, right?

91
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,200
 And I am a big guy, that's true, I'm tall, right?

92
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,600
 And so that means I always get paired with the big guy,

93
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,040
 right, nobody else is there.

94
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,220
 Like, there's always like one big guy that shows up

95
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,860
 that I get paired with, which is like,

96
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,080
 just really unfortunate.

97
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,160
 And so there's this Dallas police officer,

98
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,200
 he's 330 pounds.

99
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,640
 And he too, ironically, is a purple belt, right?

100
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,600
 And he just works me over, like, he's always just,

101
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,280
 you know, taking me to, so it's like, you're right.

102
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,600
 And so one day we're rolling and I catch him

103
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,800
 in what's called the guillotine,

104
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,180
 which is like this choke right here, and I got him.

105
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,960
 And it's like, it's in his throat, you know,

106
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,120
 I'm, yeah, finally, right?

107
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,160
 And I'm thinking, I'm gonna win for like the first time ever,

108
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,040
 like out of hundreds of times, I'm about to get him.

109
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,240
 And so I just like cinch it in, right?

110
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,040
 And I'm just, like, I'm about to get you, man.

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,200
 And he's like in and out of consciousness,

112
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,960
 but I'm a pastor, you know, I'm a believer.

113
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,000
 I'm like, I don't, man, I don't want, like, tap, dude, tap.

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,480
 But he's not tapping, right?

115
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,160
 And so I'm just, you know, trying to get him.

116
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,440
 And he gets out.

117
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,920
 He gets out.

118
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,680
 So I'm like, I'm like, I got nothing left, man.

119
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,080
 I got nothing left.

120
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,080
 Why, because why am I going to go through all that strain

121
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,720
 and all that struggle when I can just tap out?

122
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,840
 And I think it's because, especially in America,

123
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,720
 we've been trained, you've been raised,

124
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,240
 you've gone to this systematic school of thought,

125
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,920
 you tap out, you lose.

126
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,500
 You surrender, it's no good, right?

127
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,720
 But the scripture actually calls you to surrender.

128
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,000
 And some of you, you might as well go through the world

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 wearing a Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi because you're wrestling.

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,240
 You're in this place where you're trying to figure out

131
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,440
 who God is, if he loves you.

132
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,680
 And he's calling you to leave something

133
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,580
 that you don't want to leave.

134
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,000
 And you know it, you've heard it.

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,380
 You're like, gosh, how did they know?

136
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,380
 Like, it seems like they're talking to me,

137
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,220
 like why am I here?

138
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,660
 Now I know why I'm here.

139
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,440
 And you know he's calling you out of some relationship.

140
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,040
 He's calling you out of some job.

141
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,560
 Maybe he's calling you to move.

142
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,480
 He's calling you to have a conversation with somebody.

143
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,360
 He's calling you to go and ask for forgiveness.

144
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,920
 He's calling you to follow him in a new way,

145
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,440
 a new way, like an all-in kind of way.

146
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,000
 But I don't know if I can.

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,960
 Tap out.

148
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,480
 Surrender.

149
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,940
 Because to tap out, it's gonna reevaluate,

150
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,700
 it means to reevaluate what I trust,

151
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,220
 what I place my trust in.

152
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,540
 It means to reevaluate my ambition,

153
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,980
 what's driving me, where I'm going, what I'm aiming for.

154
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,760
 And it means to reevaluate my perspective,

155
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,340
 how I see the world.

156
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,660
 Am I really going to start following this Jesus

157
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,540
 and living according to his word

158
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,200
 and doing what it says and seeking to know it?

159
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,140
 And I get it, man.

160
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,300
 I stumbled into this place, hung over, sat in the back row,

161
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,220
 smelt like smoke from the club the night before.

162
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,220
 And I had been in church my whole life.

163
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,980
 Addicted to pornography, addicted to sex,

164
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,820
 loved to party, worldly, as all get out.

165
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,940
 And I was like, I'm a Christian.

166
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,820
 And I had to learn that I wasn't a Christian

167
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,820
 to become a Christian.

168
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,060
 I had to realize that I actually wasn't following Jesus

169
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,060
 so that I could follow Jesus.

170
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,140
 And maybe that's you.

171
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,940
 Like maybe the greatest thing that you can hear

172
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,420
 this morning is that you're not following Jesus,

173
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,540
 but you could start.

174
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,020
 You could start right now.

175
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,060
 You could follow him in the way you date.

176
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,860
 You could follow him in the way you work.

177
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,740
 You could follow him in the way you speak.

178
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,780
 You could follow him in the way you spend.

179
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,580
 You could follow him in the way

180
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,220
 that you choose your friend group.

181
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,620
 You could follow him on social media.

182
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,820
 You could follow him wherever you go.

183
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,580
 Or you could not.

184
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:46,740
 Some of you, you heard passionate people

185
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,380
 say things like this before.

186
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,980
 And so what's gonna be the difference in this moment?

187
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:57,420
 And I'm imploring you to tap out.

188
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,500
 Just say, okay, God, I'm tired of driving.

189
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,340
 That's what I wanna talk about,

190
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,980
 what keeps us from surrendering.

191
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,220
 We're gonna look at three things,

192
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,180
 really examine three things.

193
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,100
 See, I was raised in the church.

194
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,660
 I was a churchgoer.

195
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,780
 And the cost to go to church was really, really low.

196
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,700
 It was essentially waking up early

197
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,380
 and being bored for an hour.

198
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,260
 That was the cost to go to church.

199
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,700
 I called myself a Christian,

200
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,980
 but in reality, I was a churchgoer.

201
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,860
 The cost to follow Jesus,

202
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,300
 that meant what I did with my girlfriend needed to change.

203
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,820
 Okay, what I did on the weekends need to change.

204
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,540
 What I did after everyone went to bed needed to change.

205
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,780
 The way I handled alcohol needed to change.

206
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,740
 The way that I talked needed to change.

207
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,500
 So I was completely fine

208
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,180
 continuing to pay the cost to go to church,

209
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,100
 but I didn't want to pay the cost to follow Jesus

210
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,180
 because all I saw was cost.

211
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,180
 And I'm here and I'm sober

212
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,300
 and I'm of sound mind

213
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,980
 and I've been following Jesus now for 20 years.

214
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,220
 And I would tell you, praise Him, praise Him.

215
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,540
 (congregation applauding)

216
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,260
 And I would tell you, there is so much to gain.

217
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,260
 And I know you've experienced just a commercial of that

218
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:20,180
 over the past 48 hours, 72 hours, right?

219
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,140
 Just a commercial of what you have to gain.

220
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,620
 But if you have not surrendered to Jesus,

221
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,580
 you cannot follow Jesus.

222
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,380
 And I'm just saying that it's foolish

223
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,940
 to live in opposition to God.

224
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,100
 And so as we look at a text,

225
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,500
 we're gonna examine what you trust in.

226
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,820
 We're gonna examine your ambition.

227
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,300
 And we're going to examine your perspective

228
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,820
 because these are the three things

229
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,580
 that I think will help you understand

230
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,060
 why you haven't surrendered if you haven't surrendered.

231
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,860
 And I'm gonna look at one of the saddest stories

232
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,820
 in all of the Bible.

233
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,500
 And I tried really hard not to teach this story

234
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,420
 because it's my favorite story.

235
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,780
 I go back to it often, right?

236
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,300
 Some of you have maybe heard me teach this text

237
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,420
 in Luke 18 before.

238
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,900
 But when I think about surrender

239
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,140
 and I think about young adults,

240
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,220
 like this is where I sense the Holy Spirit

241
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,620
 continue to take me to say, hey, it's this one.

242
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,100
 And I wrestled with God myself.

243
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,140
 I'm like, are you sure, right?

244
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,620
 But I'm gonna teach this in a fresh way.

245
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,700
 Now I'm gonna show you something in this text

246
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,780
 that the vast majority of you have never heard before.

247
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,260
 That I think is so relevant to the topic of surrender.

248
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,580
 This is one of the saddest stories in all the Bible.

249
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,140
 Because most of the time, somebody interacts with Jesus

250
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,000
 and their life radically changes.

251
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,380
 But you're going to see someone your age

252
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,060
 in your situation and circumstance interact with Jesus

253
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,220
 and they leave sad because they can't tap out.

254
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,540
 They said, no, I will spend the rest of my life

255
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,760
 wrestling with you.

256
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,580
 'Cause I love the world.

257
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,760
 I can't give it up.

258
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,540
 And I know that some of you have one foot in the church

259
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,160
 and one foot in the world and you're only losing.

260
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,220
 You have so much church that you can't really enjoy

261
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,620
 the world and so much world that you can't really enjoy

262
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,140
 the church and you're like, why am I so down all the time?

263
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,260
 I know why you're down all the time.

264
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,660
 You're exhausted.

265
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,460
 You're exhausted.

266
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,980
 (claps)

267
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,840
 Luke 18, verse 18 is where I'll be.

268
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,980
 Keeps us from surrendering.

269
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,160
 This guy, because you may not have context for him,

270
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,140
 he's the OG celebrity Christian.

271
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,300
 I mean, he's like Sadie Robertson or Chris Pratt.

272
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,980
 We look at him and we think he's a bad guy.

273
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,660
 Everybody in that culture would have looked at him

274
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,660
 and he'd have like 2.6 million followers on Instagram.

275
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
 Like everybody would have looked at him as like,

276
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,460
 that's what it means to know God.

277
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,280
 Like we're gonna read all his books.

278
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,300
 Like we want to get to know this guy.

279
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,960
 It says a certain ruler asked him,

280
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,420
 we know them as the rich young ruler.

281
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,920
 That's this guy, he's the rich young ruler.

282
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,660
 That's how he's been preserved in history.

283
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,900
 Rich young ruler, good teacher.

284
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,380
 What must I do to inherit eternal life?

285
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,720
 Now pause, because if you know anything about the Bible,

286
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,020
 you think, okay, he's asking Jesus, how do I get to heaven?

287
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,260
 This is where Jesus shares the good news

288
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,660
 that he died for his sins, or he's going to die for his sins

289
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,980
 and he's gonna raise from the dead

290
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,340
 and all he needs to do is trust in him.

291
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,260
 But there's some things happening that are difficult

292
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,460
 to understand in context that I want to explain to you.

293
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,260
 Jesus says, why do you call me good?

294
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,820
 Which is a strange answer.

295
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:43,020
 No one is good except God alone.

296
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,220
 It'd be a great time to tell him you're God.

297
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,240
 You know the commandments.

298
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,080
 You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder,

299
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,880
 you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony.

300
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,320
 Honor your father and mother.

301
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,160
 And this is where the guy should say, that's too hard.

302
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,160
 I've fallen so short.

303
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,600
 But what he says is, all these I have kept

304
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,380
 since I was a boy.

305
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,520
 Here's what's happening.

306
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,960
 He says good teacher, the word there is agathos.

307
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,340
 Agathos doesn't mean man who teaches well,

308
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,220
 it means man who is good and teaches.

309
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,900
 He's saying, Jesus, you're good.

310
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,460
 This is this man's problem.

311
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,620
 What he's actually asking Jesus is,

312
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,540
 how good do I have to be to get into heaven?

313
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,620
 So Jesus says, what do you need to do to get into heaven?

314
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,660
 You need to keep the law perfectly.

315
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,380
 Do all of these things.

316
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,540
 And that man who is relying completely,

317
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,700
 he's trusting completely on his performance, says I have.

318
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,960
 Because he trusts in himself.

319
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,640
 He trusts in his ability.

320
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,000
 He trusts in his striving.

321
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,920
 And so that's the first thing as you consider

322
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,380
 what to examine if you feel like maybe

323
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,660
 you haven't surrendered is your trust.

324
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,520
 What do you trust in?

325
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,600
 My hunch is for most of you,

326
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,180
 the problem's gonna be in one of two categories.

327
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,240
 You trust in your performance or you trust in your sin.

328
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,940
 Trusting in your sin, that's strange.

329
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,700
 I'm gonna explain that in just a minute.

330
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,860
 But let's talk about performance for a second.

331
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,820
 Like this guy right here, he's got a black belt in church.

332
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,420
 Like he's the guy that shows up early,

333
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,220
 he sets out the chairs, he stays late,

334
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,400
 he's memorized the Torah, like he's got it going on.

335
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,360
 He's followed all of the rules.

336
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,620
 So when he says, hey, what must I do?

337
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,200
 Jesus is really trying to show him what you must do

338
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,300
 is realize that you'll never do enough.

339
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:49,580
 Tap out, surrender.

340
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,560
 And so this is where he's pulling him in the story.

341
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,840
 This is where he's trying to take him.

342
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,820
 So what do you trust in?

343
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,500
 Some of you might trust in your accomplishments

344
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,740
 like this man.

345
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,580
 I did that.

346
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,060
 There was this time where life got really busy

347
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,020
 and it got busy with really good things.

348
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,080
 I had written this book, Welcome to Adulting,

349
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,320
 had just come out.

350
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,320
 And that kind of put me on this speaking circuit.

351
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,100
 And so I'm traveling, I'm on planes,

352
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,940
 like some of them nice planes.

353
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,820
 I'm doing things I never thought I would get to do

354
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,960
 in ministry.

355
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,280
 You can actually make money in ministry.

356
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,820
 So that was interesting.

357
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,420
 This was all like new territory for me.

358
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,580
 And people wanted to be around me.

359
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,960
 They're like, let's take a picture.

360
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,100
 Well, you signed my book.

361
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,260
 And I'm like, this is new.

362
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,420
 Like I got in ministry to set out chairs and serve people.

363
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,140
 Like I didn't, you know, like now you think,

364
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,100
 well, I want to go into ministry.

365
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,820
 I want a spotlight on me and a microphone.

366
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,420
 I got into ministry 'cause I was like, you know what?

367
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,900
 I'd love to understand the word and help people live by it.

368
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,940
 Like in one-on-one conversations.

369
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,700
 And God just began to do this thing.

370
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,940
 And the weight got really heavy.

371
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,300
 And I had taught on anxiety my whole life.

372
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,360
 But one day I'm laying in this hotel room

373
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,540
 about to speak at one of the largest churches

374
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,380
 in the country.

375
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,200
 It's not a flex.

376
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,540
 It's just where I was that day.

377
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,980
 And all of a sudden I start having panic attacks.

378
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,500
 Waking up like with a jolt of electricity.

379
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,180
 My heart's beating really hard.

380
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,220
 Anxiety jumped on me.

381
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,380
 I go to the doctor.

382
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,060
 Then I go to a therapist.

383
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,280
 And essentially this therapist who went to school

384
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,540
 to help people like me in my situation says,

385
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,880
 you need to sit still.

386
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,580
 Like, what do you mean sit still?

387
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,420
 I'm sitting still.

388
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,340
 He's like, no, like every day you just need to be still

389
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,960
 for an extended period of time.

390
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,340
 Like, oh, yeah, like a quiet time.

391
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,240
 I get the sense you're rushing those.

392
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,180
 Checking boxes, reading things.

393
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,640
 They're like, oh, so I can tell your small group you did.

394
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,060
 No, sit still.

395
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,360
 Like a Psalm 46 10 kind of thing.

396
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,380
 Be still and know that he's God.

397
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,420
 Like at some point in this journey,

398
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,440
 you started to think that you're God

399
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,040
 and you weren't meant to carry the weight that God carries.

400
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,020
 You need to sit still.

401
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,520
 And so that was my prescription, right?

402
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,480
 Like that's what I left the doctor with.

403
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,160
 Oh, I need to go and sit still.

404
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,240
 And so I started doing it every morning.

405
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,620
 And God worked through that to heal me.

406
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,140
 To remove the anxiety in my life.

407
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,580
 Maybe that's a word for some of you.

408
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,500
 You realize like, yeah, I've got that.

409
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,420
 That happens to me.

410
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,180
 Jolt of electricity, I know what he's talking about.

411
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,380
 Yeah, I don't sit still.

412
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,980
 Sit still, what does he mean by that?

413
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,900
 I mean sit still.

414
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,800
 Like in a chair, sure.

415
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,640
 Doing what?

416
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,460
 Nothing.

417
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,540
 Just knowing that he's God and you're not.

418
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,380
 For how long?

419
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,760
 Longer than you're comfortable doing it.

420
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,420
 Like wait until you don't wanna do it anymore

421
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,500
 and then go like another 35 minutes.

422
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,700
 And I'm serious, right?

423
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,580
 The other thing that can show me

424
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,020
 that you're trusting in your ability

425
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,580
 is you think your sin's so big.

426
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,420
 And so I remember when a rich young ruler

427
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,020
 walked into this place, actually the tower next door,

428
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,380
 and he was asked two questions.

429
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,180
 Between one and 10, 10 being certain,

430
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,660
 one being not so sure.

431
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,980
 If you died today, how certain are you

432
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,260
 that you would go to heaven between one and 10?

433
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,300
 Maybe you've heard that question, maybe you haven't,

434
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,060
 but let me put it in front of you again.

435
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,060
 Between one and 10, 10 being certain,

436
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,040
 I know for a fact that I will go to heaven,

437
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,080
 one probably won't go to heaven.

438
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,500
 Where in that spectrum are you,

439
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,980
 what's the number that you would say,

440
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,540
 can we just play this game real quick?

441
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,860
 So I'd love to know who I'm talking to.

442
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,860
 Can everybody shut their eyes?

443
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,540
 Okay, everyone in the room's gonna raise their hand

444
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,620
 on this deal, okay?

445
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,300
 So I'm gonna ask you a couple questions.

446
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,140
 Between one and 10, I want you to get your number

447
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,760
 with your eyes closed, I'm watching your purse,

448
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,260
 you know, I'm making sure nobody's moving, okay?

449
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,740
 With your eyes closed, get your number.

450
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,440
 Between one and 10, how certain are you?

451
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,500
 If you died right now, how certain are you

452
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,900
 that you would go to heaven?

453
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,620
 Just hang tight, I'm gonna ask you a question,

454
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,940
 you don't have to put your hands up, right?

455
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,740
 So I'll just say, some of you, you're pretty sure

456
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,660
 you're like an eight or a nine.

457
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,780
 How many of you are an eight or a nine?

458
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,820
 Raise your hand.

459
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,940
 Okay, lots of eights or nines, great.

460
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,100
 Some message moved you or something.

461
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,680
 Okay, how many of you are a five, six, or seven?

462
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,500
 Okay, several fives, sixes, or sevens.

463
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,260
 Yeah, I see you, I see you.

464
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:51,120
 Okay, how many of you are a two, three, four?

465
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,860
 You got a place where I'm a two, three, four,

466
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,040
 that's how sure I am, the others seem arrogant,

467
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,440
 like I just, not sure where I'm at right now.

468
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,760
 A few two, threes, or fours?

469
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,880
 Okay, okay, you can open your eyes.

470
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,280
 So that person was asked between one and 10,

471
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,120
 how certain are you that you would go to heaven?

472
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,300
 He said seven.

473
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,840
 And the second question is, if you stood before God,

474
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,640
 and he says, why should I let you in, what would you say?

475
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,280
 And this guy, like this guy is, he was the rich unruly.

476
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,360
 Like he was kind of everything wrong

477
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,360
 with Dallas in a person, right?

478
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,040
 I mean, truly, like he had, he drove a Jaguar.

479
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,960
 Like let's just be honest,

480
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,400
 that's like the most obnoxious car, right?

481
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,680
 It's not reliable, like it's just, it just says,

482
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,720
 look at me, I'm Cash McMogelson, right?

483
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,400
 And so, drives a Jaguar, has a Brioni suit,

484
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,120
 thousand, multiple thousand dollar suit,

485
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,520
 like he had all the things, new watches

486
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,080
 for every day of the week.

487
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,420
 He says, how sure are you?

488
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,280
 And he says, why should God let you in?

489
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,280
 He says, because I do good.

490
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,780
 Because I tried hard, because I loved him, right?

491
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:06,440
 And what I want you to know is nobody gets to heaven

492
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,400
 because they do good, because they tried hard,

493
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,500
 because they love him.

494
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,480
 Even the demons know about God and shudder.

495
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,360
 The only way that we get to heaven is by trusting,

496
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,920
 trusting in the finished work of Jesus Christ

497
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,920
 to pay our way in.

498
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,080
 That's the only way we get into heaven.

499
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,720
 And so you might think, right, well, if I say a 10,

500
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,920
 that's arrogant.

501
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,920
 No, to say a nine is arrogant.

502
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,480
 Because you say a nine, you're like,

503
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,240
 there's something that I can do

504
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,760
 that's bigger than the cross.

505
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,080
 God, you wasted your son's death on me

506
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,520
 because I'm a bigger sinner than your payment.

507
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,280
 What?

508
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,480
 Careful.

509
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,680
 Nah, his sin is, his payment's way bigger than your sin.

510
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,400
 His sin, he doesn't have any.

511
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,280
 His payment's way bigger than your sin.

512
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,660
 So why not start trusting in that completely?

513
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,840
 I'm all in, like I believe that Jesus Christ

514
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,840
 died for my sins, that God raised him from the dead, right?

515
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:20,000
 If you could get to God by your effort,

516
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,640
 then he wasted the death of his son, Jesus.

517
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,560
 I want you to know that you cannot miss heaven

518
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,520
 because of any sin that you've committed,

519
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,960
 and you cannot get there because of any righteous act

520
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,200
 you've committed.

521
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,960
 Only by the blood of Jesus.

522
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
 See, where this shows up in the scripture is important,

523
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,400
 because it comes right after this verse 15,

524
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,200
 which is where they're bringing babies to Jesus

525
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,040
 for him to place his hands on them.

526
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,680
 And when the disciples saw this, it says,

527
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,440
 they rebuked him, but Jesus called the children to him

528
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,160
 and said, "Let the children come to me

529
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,960
 "and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God

530
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,340
 "belongs to such as these.

531
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,300
 "Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive

532
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,740
 "the kingdom of God like a little child

533
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,200
 "will never enter into it."

534
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,800
 And what's true about a child

535
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,000
 is they have nothing to offer anyone.

536
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,200
 Like all they do is take.

537
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,760
 And Jesus is like, this is who you need to learn from.

538
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,800
 This is your example, that you bring nothing to God

539
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,920
 except need.

540
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,320
 What do I need to get into heaven?

541
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,440
 Need.

542
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,480
 You need to be needy.

543
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,020
 You need to be at a place of surrender,

544
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,920
 to say, God, I can't, but you can.

545
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,120
 I'm not strong enough, I'm not good enough,

546
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,360
 I'm not smart enough, I haven't memorized enough scripture,

547
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,600
 I'm not articulate enough or educated enough.

548
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,120
 I can't, but you can.

549
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,720
 And that place of surrender is where I want you to stay.

550
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,720
 That's the place where God's gonna use you.

551
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,300
 You start turning all things over to him.

552
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,620
 So back into the story, verse 22.

553
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:58,940
 The man says, "What do I gotta do to get into heaven?"

554
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,140
 Jesus says, "What do you gotta do?

555
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,580
 "Like on your own?

556
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,660
 "You gotta obey the law."

557
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,160
 And he says, "I have."

558
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,460
 And then Jesus said, it says,

559
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,500
 when he heard this, he said to him,

560
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,520
 "You still lack one thing.

561
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,980
 "Sell everything you have, give to the poor,

562
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,440
 "and you will have treasure in heaven.

563
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,500
 "Then come, follow me."

564
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,300
 And I've always read this text wrong,

565
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,620
 like all my life until I would say about four years ago,

566
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,660
 I read this text wrong because I always thought

567
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,140
 like Jesus is just messing with this guy.

568
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,420
 Like he is going Ashton Kutcher straight punking this dude.

569
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,140
 Like he's like, "Oh, what do you gotta do?"

570
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,180
 You know, "Hey, let me give you some rule.

571
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,340
 "You ready, buddy?"

572
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,900
 I'm ready, and he's like got the disciples there.

573
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,820
 He's like, "Hey guys, listen, okay, watch this, man.

574
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,920
 "This guy thinks he's good.

575
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,420
 "You know, you hear him, he thinks he follows the rules.

576
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,540
 "So watch this, okay?

577
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,580
 "Hey, it's just one thing you gotta do.

578
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,140
 "Sell everything you have, give it to the poor,

579
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,980
 "and follow me."

580
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,980
 Watch this, watch this.

581
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,620
 Are you sad?

582
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,700
 (congregation laughing)

583
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,540
 You look sad.

584
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,620
 That's how I always thought that's what he was saying,

585
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,180
 you know, like Jesus is just coming after him.

586
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,980
 But in Mark, hey, listen, listen, listen.

587
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,260
 In Mark, that's important.

588
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,280
 In the Gospel of Mark, okay?

589
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,220
 In the Gospel of Mark, it adds this detail

590
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,860
 that's not in any other Gospels.

591
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,820
 It says this.

592
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,780
 Teacher, he declared, "All these I have kept

593
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,660
 "since I was a boy."

594
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,400
 And it says Jesus looked at him and loved him.

595
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,660
 So Jesus looks at him, he's like,

596
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,060
 "No, you don't understand.

597
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,300
 "I just want you to surrender."

598
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,600
 That's what this is, friends.

599
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,200
 This right here in this text,

600
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,200
 this is Jesus giving him an invitation to surrender.

601
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,520
 Will you surrender everything to me?

602
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,740
 Will you leave everything behind and follow me?

603
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,380
 But it says when he heard this,

604
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,140
 he became very sad because he was very wealthy.

605
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:02,500
 He wasn't ready to surrender 'cause he had some stuff.

606
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:08,020
 He had some trinkets and some treasures and some things.

607
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,000
 To understand if you've surrendered,

608
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,220
 I want you to examine your ambition.

609
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,980
 Okay, your ambition is your drive,

610
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,220
 it's what you're aiming for.

611
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,140
 And the reason I use that word ambition,

612
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,140
 because this was an ambitious guy.

613
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,900
 The thing that he didn't want to lose was his money.

614
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,640
 The thing that he loved more than following Jesus

615
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,960
 was his great wealth.

616
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,760
 The text goes out of its way to show us that.

617
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,760
 This man didn't follow Jesus because he wanted things.

618
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,860
 And he didn't want to leave those things behind

619
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,940
 to follow Jesus.

620
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,620
 Now what is it that you don't want to leave behind

621
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,780
 to follow Jesus?

622
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,620
 Is it a relationship?

623
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,940
 Is it an engagement?

624
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,500
 I talked to a young woman right out there yesterday

625
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,580
 and she just said, "You know what?

626
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,300
 "I just called off my engagement."

627
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,980
 I said, "Man, that's so hard."

628
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,640
 She said, "Yeah, he knew God,

629
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,220
 "but he didn't follow Jesus."

630
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,620
 To which I might say, "He didn't know God."

631
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,340
 And you did the right thing and I know it was costly.

632
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,420
 Invitations go out, everyone's looking forward to it,

633
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,060
 you feel embarrassed.

634
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,560
 It's so worth it.

635
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,260
 It's so worth it.

636
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:25,060
 And you're here and you're like, "Man, yeah, I've got drive.

637
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,900
 "You know, I want to be a millionaire before I'm 30.

638
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,300
 "I want to change the world.

639
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,540
 "I want to go Elon Musk on this place.

640
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,860
 "Like, let's go, you know?

641
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,080
 "I got me a little Dogecoin, it's gonna be awesome, right?

642
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,880
 "I'm watching, yeah, I get it, I get it, you know?

643
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,300
 "I'm a wise investor."

644
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,560
 What do you love more than Jesus?

645
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,340
 Like, what is it if he asks you to give it up,

646
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,600
 you'd be like, "No, I can't do that.

647
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,200
 "Don't, please, please,

648
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,200
 "don't convict me too much right now, please.

649
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,140
 "I'm nervous, this isn't fun anymore.

650
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,500
 "Like, let's go back to the dance party.

651
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,480
 "I don't stop this, okay?

652
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,600
 "What's next?"

653
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,700
 Ambition is what you're aiming for, right?

654
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,260
 This guy, he's aiming for wealth.

655
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,160
 That's what he desires in this world.

656
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,660
 I want to ask you, do you believe that Jesus

657
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,260
 has something better than what you're holding onto?

658
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,700
 Like, do you really believe that

659
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,780
 at a heart and hands level?

660
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,820
 'Cause this is what it says in Mark, again.

661
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,580
 Chapter eight, verse 36 in the Gospel of Mark.

662
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,060
 "What good is it for someone to gain the whole world

663
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,060
 "and yet forfeit their soul?"

664
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:49,300
 There's an Olympian rifle shooter, Matthew Emmons.

665
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,900
 And I'm not sure if you've heard of him.

666
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,180
 Here's a picture of him.

667
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,980
 He's the most decorated rifle shooter in history.

668
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,220
 Multiple medals in the Olympics, right?

669
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,740
 He is the best.

670
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,700
 He's kind of like the Michael Phelps of his day,

671
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,540
 if you will.

672
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,740
 Like, he's by far the best at this sport.

673
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,340
 So what happens, and I know a lot of you are like,

674
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,700
 rifle shooting, my favorite.

675
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,980
 But people would come to see him from all over

676
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,580
 because he was so good at what he did.

677
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,340
 And he had already had a medal in the Olympics

678
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,860
 and he's there in his second event,

679
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,680
 but this particular event is the one that he's the best at.

680
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,300
 And so everybody's there watching him

681
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,580
 because he's a phenom.

682
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,260
 Like, he's the greatest at this event.

683
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,180
 Like, he just shoots right in the middle of the bullseye

684
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,980
 and he's already had one great shot

685
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,420
 and all he needs to do is hit the target to medal.

686
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,220
 And so there he is, he takes aim at the target

687
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,740
 and everybody holds their breath as they watch

688
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,820
 and he shoots the target

689
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,200
 and he hits right dead center of the bullseye,

690
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,140
 but the crowd responds very different and he's confused.

691
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:59,500
 And then he realizes he aimed at the wrong target.

692
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,600
 He shot the target left to his target,

693
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,980
 which means he completely missed his target.

694
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,700
 And while he hit a bullseye, it wasn't the right bullseye.

695
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,020
 I think there's a picture of those targets, the results.

696
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,140
 So that's him, the second one, it's blank.

697
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:22,200
 And had he just hit the target, he'd have left with the medal

698
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,700
 but it's the realization that he aimed at the wrong target.

699
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,220
 Some of you are here right now

700
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,380
 and you're aiming at the wrong target.

701
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,260
 If I sat down with you and we said,

702
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,020
 "Hey, what do you most want?"

703
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,060
 You'd be like, "White picket fence,

704
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,380
 "German shepherd, two kids, with silly names."

705
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,860
 I've got this Pinterest, it's amazing.

706
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,540
 "What do you most want, man?"

707
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,140
 I just really wanna get and climb the corporate ladder,

708
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,780
 get to the top, own a company.

709
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,500
 I got this GoFundMe thing happening,

710
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,060
 it's gonna be amazing, we can take it public, IPO.

711
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,340
 "What do you most want?"

712
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,180
 I really just, like a shack on the beach,

713
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,780
 take it easy, surf all day.

714
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,860
 That seems, "What do you most want?"

715
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,440
 Avoid hard things.

716
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,300
 "What do you most want?"

717
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,700
 Him to ask me out, her to say yes.

718
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,300
 "What do you most, what are you aiming for?"

719
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,780
 And I hope in just a few minutes,

720
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:24,740
 what you're aiming for is I want my entire life,

721
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:29,700
 all of my being to go all in 100 with Jesus.

722
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,140
 Like 100%, I'm all in Jesus,

723
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,980
 you can take anything from me and I'm gonna follow you

724
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,340
 'cause we're gonna be dead soon

725
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,940
 and what's it gonna matter then?

726
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,580
 And I'm just gonna tell you again,

727
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,180
 I'm gonna remind you I'm sober,

728
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,120
 I'm of sound mind, and I'm just telling you it's worth it.

729
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,940
 That anything that you would give up to follow Jesus

730
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,700
 is absolutely worth it.

731
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,960
 Verse 24.

732
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,960
 "Jesus looked at him and said,

733
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,960
 "'How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God.

734
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,960
 "'How hard it is for those in America,

735
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,600
 "'in the comfortable church, with the comfortable chairs,

736
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,700
 "'in the central air and heat, carrying their Bibles,

737
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,360
 "'singing worship to amazing bands,

738
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,440
 "'how hard it is for them to enter the kingdom of God.'"

739
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,320
 Remember, this guy's Christian 18, okay?

740
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,440
 "And indeed, it is easier for a camel

741
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,600
 "to go through the eye of a needle

742
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,120
 "than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."

743
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,300
 Now maybe you've heard, like people try to speak that away,

744
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,800
 like, oh, the eye of the needle's like a gate in Jerusalem

745
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,920
 and camels, no, no, no.

746
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,600
 He's speaking in hyperbole.

747
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,320
 He's talking about a giant animal

748
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,800
 getting through a tiny little hole

749
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,440
 and he's saying it's that hard for someone

750
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,780
 who is so well-resourced and distracted by the world

751
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,840
 to understand their need for Jesus.

752
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,400
 That's why this text is in your Bible.

753
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,040
 It's a wake-up call.

754
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,800
 He's saying, hey, this is really hard.

755
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,240
 So he's speaking in hyperbole.

756
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,920
 He's like, hey, it would be easier to out-style JD,

757
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,720
 you know, something crazy like that, right?

758
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,720
 He's saying, hey, this is almost impossible.

759
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,520
 That's why they respond the way they do, okay?

760
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,360
 That's why they say, well, who then can be saved?

761
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,720
 And he says, what is impossible with God,

762
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,760
 or what is impossible with man is possible with God.

763
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,500
 I've said it like this before.

764
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,840
 It's like he's saying, hey, you wanna get into heaven?

765
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,800
 You gotta be fast.

766
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,940
 And they say, well, how fast do you have to be?

767
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,240
 And he says, you know Usain Bolt?

768
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,460
 Like, yeah, 'cause he's not fast enough.

769
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,960
 So then they're like, whoa,

770
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,640
 well, who then can get into heaven?

771
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,760
 Because remember, this guy was seen

772
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,940
 as the Christian black belt, the A-team.

773
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,460
 Like, everybody's looking at him and saying,

774
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,740
 man, if we could only know God like he does.

775
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,340
 And then Jesus says, this guy, he's not gonna get in.

776
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,760
 And they're like, whoa, hold on, wait, wait, wait, why?

777
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,740
 'Cause he can't surrender.

778
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:12,740
 See, he's got just enough God and just enough world

779
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:17,620
 to never really have all of God, okay?

780
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,900
 So he's not getting in.

781
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,640
 And that's why he leaves sad.

782
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,140
 And that's why Jesus has compassion on him.

783
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,840
 And that's why Peter says, wait, wait, wait,

784
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,060
 hold on, hold on, Jesus.

785
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,200
 You know, we've left all, we had to follow you.

786
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,420
 And truly, Jesus says, truly, I tell you,

787
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:38,700
 no one who has, and this is important, really important.

788
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,500
 No one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters

789
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,100
 or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God

790
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,980
 will fail to receive many times as much in this age

791
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,020
 and in the age to come eternal life.

792
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,660
 And what Peter is saying is,

793
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,500
 Jesus, it's been all cost for us.

794
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,940
 We did it, man.

795
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,580
 We walked away from our jobs for you.

796
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,940
 We walked away from our relationships for you.

797
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,180
 We walked away from our families for you.

798
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,300
 We did it.

799
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,540
 Jesus is like, you hadn't walked away from anything.

800
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,340
 I've taken it, I've multiplied it,

801
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,420
 and I've set it in front of you.

802
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,660
 You're walking toward it forever and ever.

803
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,100
 Don't you understand, Peter, you're gonna be dead soon.

804
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,980
 Nobody gets up to God like, hey, man,

805
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,220
 why didn't I get married?

806
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,880
 Where was my German shepherd?

807
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,760
 No, no, no, no.

808
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,920
 Whatever you sacrifice for my sake,

809
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,520
 I'm guaranteeing with my blood, it will be worth it.

810
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,160
 And I know some of you are like, yeah, yeah, okay, okay,

811
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,400
 but I get married, right?

812
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,080
 I don't know.

813
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,920
 Probably.

814
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,080
 Probably.

815
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,280
 But I do know it won't matter 100 years from now.

816
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,640
 I do know that.

817
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,360
 And that's crazy to think about.

818
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,240
 That's wild to think about.

819
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,280
 You gotta have that eternal perspective.

820
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,280
 And that's my third and final point.

821
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,040
 Understand, if you've surrendered,

822
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,000
 I want you to examine your perspective.

823
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,600
 How do you see the world?

824
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,360
 Are you living with an eternal perspective

825
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,680
 or a worldly perspective?

826
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,040
 Because there's so much in this world

827
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,760
 that's just a distraction.

828
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,500
 You'll start to think this is all there is

829
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,760
 and that you have to actually live

830
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,080
 with an atheist worldview, which is like, okay,

831
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,640
 I die and I get put in the ground

832
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,600
 and nothing happens to me.

833
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,960
 Worms just eat me.

834
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,160
 And so I need to cram in as much fun

835
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,280
 and as much pleasure and as much attention

836
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,520
 and as much affirmation, right, and rewards

837
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,800
 and all the things in my little 76 years here.

838
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,920
 And that is antithesis to the gospel.

839
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,680
 Like, that's the thing is there's so many people

840
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,640
 in the church on a Sunday morning

841
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,840
 living with an atheist perspective,

842
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,400
 calling themselves Christians,

843
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,560
 raising their hands at songs,

844
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,880
 but actually living with an atheistic perspective,

845
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,880
 not a biblical perspective, not an eternal perspective.

846
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,280
 They're just living for this world.

847
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,560
 And that will keep you from surrendering

848
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,920
 because you'll start to want to make a home here.

849
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,720
 Peter's like, we left it all.

850
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,640
 Jesus is like, no, you haven't.

851
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,840
 When I was in college, we were,

852
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,840
 I ran with this group and we all would go wakeboarding

853
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,460
 and we were coming home from the lake.

854
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,400
 We're coming home from the lake

855
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,760
 and I was riding with my buddy in his Tahoe

856
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,480
 and right there on the console,

857
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,200
 so I'm in the passenger seat, he's driving,

858
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,920
 and right there on the console is this check.

859
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,400
 In his name, for $23,000.

860
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,080
 Now in college, I had never in my life

861
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,320
 seen a check for $23,000,

862
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,440
 other than like on TV kind of stuff, right?

863
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,000
 Press, Price is Right kind of stuff.

864
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,920
 But the first time in my life to see a check for,

865
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,720
 and I've got no money in college.

866
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,520
 Like, I'm poor as can be

867
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,140
 and I see this check for $23,000 and so I stole it.

868
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,980
 No, I didn't, I'm kidding.

869
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,720
 And so I, I'm just joking.

870
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,880
 Just making sure you're paying attention.

871
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,880
 And so I'm like, whoa, buddy, what is that?

872
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,480
 And he's just driving down the road.

873
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,800
 He's like, oh, that's that, that's this,

874
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,240
 this check my grandma gives me every month.

875
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:35,540
 (congregation laughing)

876
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:39,760
 Wait, wait, you say your grandma gives you every month?

877
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,440
 Yeah, man, it goes into this account.

878
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,080
 I can't get it until I'm 30.

879
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,100
 Okay, does she need some more grandkids?

880
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,920
 Like, can I apply for this position?

881
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,080
 Like what's, I was just like,

882
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,840
 I was, I was so dumbfounded in this moment.

883
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,880
 I'm like, you get $23,000 every month

884
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,440
 that goes into an account that you have access to

885
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,900
 when you're 30?

886
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,400
 Bro, how do you have a bad day?

887
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,240
 You know what I mean?

888
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,120
 Like, like, I mean, whatever happens, you lose your job.

889
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,120
 You're like, it's okay, 'cause I'm loaded.

890
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,400
 You know, you like ask a girl out,

891
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,960
 hey, would you like to go on a date with me?

892
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,800
 And she's like, no.

893
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,040
 And you're like, that's okay,

894
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,480
 'cause I got $23,000 this month and you didn't, you know?

895
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,320
 (congregation laughing)

896
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,960
 I'm like, like, how, how do you have,

897
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,360
 how could you ever be sad?

898
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,240
 Like, I just, like, if I'm ever sad, I'd be like,

899
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,400
 oh, but one day, you know, I'm gonna be 30,

900
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,600
 30 and flirty, right?

901
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,560
 That's what I was like, what, like, what,

902
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,880
 like, what is really going on here, you know?

903
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,720
 And I'm like, I tell him,

904
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,160
 I'm like, you're a trust fund baby, bro.

905
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,020
 Like, you're a straight up trust fund baby.

906
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:50,920
 You're a trust fund baby.

907
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,400
 Don't you get it?

908
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,280
 $23,000, that's a joke.

909
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,760
 That's what they paved the streets with there.

910
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,280
 You hear me?

911
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,120
 Like, that's a joke.

912
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,960
 Like, you have eternal riches,

913
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,320
 glorious riches at his right hand forever and ever

914
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,840
 and ever and ever, more than any money can buy

915
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,560
 when you are adopted as daughters and sons

916
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,940
 to the most high king through the blood of his son

917
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,760
 by trusting in his death and resurrection

918
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,360
 for the forgiveness of your sins,

919
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,480
 not trusting in you not being a sinner,

920
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,160
 but trusting in you being made righteous

921
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,180
 because of his righteousness being imputed on you.

922
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,420
 And I know those are some, like, big seminary words,

923
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,120
 but that's the way that it works.

924
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,680
 Like, in that moment, God says, why should I let you in,

925
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,080
 which I don't think it happens that way,

926
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,360
 but if he did, right, you could point to your resume,

927
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,320
 right, I'm proficient in Microsoft Word,

928
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:50,320
 or you could point to Jesus's resume, I'm perfect, right?

929
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,240
 That's the option that you have.

930
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,960
 You can go all in by trusting in his works right now.

931
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,800
 You don't even have to go anywhere,

932
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,640
 you don't have to do anything,

933
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,800
 you don't have to change your clothes,

934
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,880
 you don't have to put a gi on,

935
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,600
 you don't have to do nothing, right?

936
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,060
 You just, I trust Jesus died for my sins.

937
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,280
 God raised him from the dead.

938
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,800
 Okay, but then how certain am I that I'm gonna go to heaven?

939
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,920
 You're certain.

940
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:20,600
 What if I, what if you, anything,

941
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,640
 because it's everything to do with his works,

942
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:28,640
 that's the gospel, that's the gospel, that's the gospel.

943
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,040
 Like that, like, you know, that guy on TikTok is like,

944
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,040
 that's what I wanna do right now, right?

945
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,320
 That's the gospel, you know?

946
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,720
 Like, that's what I'm trying to say.

947
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,220
 It's his works, not your works.

948
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:47,220
 You are not gonna out-sin the crucifixion.

949
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,180
 You're not.

950
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:53,300
 That's what he's calling you to, right?

951
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,580
 If you don't have Jesus, this is as good as it gets.

952
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,380
 But if you have a relationship with Jesus,

953
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,100
 if you've surrendered your life to him,

954
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,680
 this is as bad as it's ever going to be.

955
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,380
 And I want you to know, because I know some of you,

956
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,660
 you've experienced some of the last few days,

957
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,860
 like following Jesus is an adventure.

958
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,980
 Like, it's amazing.

959
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,340
 Like, I'm telling you, I have sinned in epic proportions.

960
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,980
 You do name it, what are we talking?

961
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:24,180
 Molly, we talking weed, you know, whatever.

962
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,860
 We're getting drunk, hugging toilets, strip clubs,

963
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,260
 right, the whole deal, pornography,

964
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,020
 things that if I told you, you would be so uncomfortable.

965
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,580
 You're like, I'm never listening to that guy again.

966
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,500
 It's all there.

967
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,700
 You don't ever have to listen to me again

968
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,360
 'cause it's all there.

969
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,980
 It's all there and it's all been covered.

970
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,260
 And it doesn't mean, like, right,

971
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,860
 I'm not afraid to talk about it

972
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,180
 because he set me free from it.

973
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,500
 I'm not walking around all like full of shame.

974
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,900
 I'm like, no, he set me free from it.

975
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,220
 I can boast in the Savior.

976
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,660
 I can boast in the Savior, Jesus Christ.

977
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,900
 (congregation applauding)

978
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,060
 That's what he's done.

979
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:01,860
 But he's calling this guy to the adventure of a lifetime.

980
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,020
 And this poor guy, right, like Jesus is like, follow me.

981
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,100
 Like, he could have been the 13th disciple.

982
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,600
 Somebody we name our children after,

983
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,380
 like Matthew or John or Luke.

984
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,940
 But he's like, I don't know, man.

985
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,180
 See, I got a lot of stuff.

986
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,380
 But he's talking to the guy with all the stuff.

987
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,660
 The cattle on a thousand hills are his.

988
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,300
 All the stuff is his.

989
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,220
 This dude's just got it on loan.

990
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,180
 This guy's king of the universe.

991
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,020
 And he's like, I don't know

992
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,860
 if I really want to follow you, right,

993
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,380
 'cause I'm a rich young ruler.

994
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,820
 You're a joke, right?

995
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,860
 Today, dude's not rich.

996
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:36,860
 He's no longer young and he's not ruling anything.

997
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,740
 He missed out, right?

998
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,700
 We don't even know his name.

999
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,700
 Just three little adjectives.

1000
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,900
 Some of you are here and your aim is,

1001
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,980
 well, I want to be rich.

1002
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,380
 I want to stay young.

1003
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,260
 I want to be in charge.

1004
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,620
 It's exhausting.

1005
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:14,100
 And the enemy's gonna come around you

1006
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,380
 and tell you you can't.

1007
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,180
 And here's what I want you to do.

1008
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,540
 What jujitsu does is it uses

1009
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,900
 your opponent's strength against them.

1010
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,060
 That's kind of how it works.

1011
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:23,940
 It's like they come at you

1012
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,340
 and you just use their strength against them.

1013
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,060
 So that when the enemy says, hey, you can't,

1014
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,020
 say, you're right, but he can.

1015
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,380
 He's gonna come in and he's gonna say,

1016
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,660
 hey, listen, you're not good enough.

1017
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,340
 Say, oh, I know.

1018
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,580
 I know.

1019
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,540
 But he is, right?

1020
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,540
 And he's gonna say, hey, don't you remember prom night

1021
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,900
 or last night or last week?

1022
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:51,780
 You know, don't you see how great a sinner you are?

1023
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,300
 And you just say, absolutely.

1024
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,780
 But I have a great Savior.

1025
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,540
 I have a greater Savior.

1026
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,660
 You just use his strength against him.

1027
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:02,020
 Jujitsu that guy.

1028
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,100
 What's up, you know?

1029
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,540
 Guillotine, right?

1030
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,060
 And you just tap out.

1031
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,940
 I don't need to wrestle anymore.

1032
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,900
 Jesus did the work for me on the cross.

1033
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,380
 I'm gonna tap out, right?

1034
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:24,740
 So surrender your trust, your ambition, your perspective.

1035
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,860
 Examine those things.

1036
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,820
 I'm gonna end with just some good news.

1037
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:33,740
 Maybe we do know who this guy is.

1038
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,860
 Really interesting things when you start studying

1039
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,300
 church history.

1040
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,340
 Who's the rich young ruler?

1041
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,580
 We don't know his name.

1042
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:45,980
 Yeah, man, I kinda stumbled upon some things

1043
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,140
 that are pretty fascinating.

1044
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:52,140
 For 1,500 years, it was believed

1045
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,980
 that the rich young ruler was actually Mark,

1046
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,580
 who wrote the Gospel of Mark.

1047
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,740
 And let me just see if I can get you there,

1048
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,260
 'cause I've been in it, right?

1049
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,420
 And it's okay if you don't agree with this,

1050
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,460
 but for a long time, people did.

1051
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,940
 And I think it's fascinating.

1052
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,220
 Remember, Mark's the one who said

1053
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,220
 he looked at him and loved him.

1054
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,980
 He added that detail.

1055
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,460
 And there's something that only shows up

1056
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,100
 in the Gospel of Mark.

1057
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,760
 And it's this guy who's naked when Jesus is arrested.

1058
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,420
 There's someone there who doesn't have any clothes on,

1059
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,500
 which is weird.

1060
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,140
 It's a weird detail to add.

1061
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,260
 Like, if I was Mark, I'd just have skipped that detail,

1062
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,780
 'cause everybody else did, right?

1063
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,620
 But he adds it in.

1064
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,540
 It's Mark 14.

1065
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,300
 A young man wearing nothing but a linen garment

1066
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,740
 was following Jesus when they seized him.

1067
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,360
 He fled naked, leaving his garment behind, right?

1068
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,140
 And so, like, they come up, right?

1069
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,280
 And all he has is like this, you know,

1070
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,120
 kind of like a robe.

1071
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,700
 And they grab the robe, and he's just like,

1072
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,620
 "Take the robe," you know?

1073
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:48,200
 And he's in his, like, you know, birthday suit,

1074
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,620
 just running down the road.

1075
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,740
 And it's like, why did Mark add that detail?

1076
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,200
 Well, because for 1,500 years of church history,

1077
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,540
 that was believed to be Mark,

1078
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,980
 also believed to be the rich young ruler,

1079
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,700
 who sold everything that he left sad,

1080
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,980
 and then he came to his senses,

1081
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,980
 and says, "Okay, I'm gonna sell it all,

1082
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,100
 "and I'm gonna follow Jesus."

1083
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,700
 So maybe he was one of the 12.

1084
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,900
 Listen, this is what Richard Wurmbrand said.

1085
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,140
 The Greek word, eutheos.

1086
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,460
 Eutheos means straightaway.

1087
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,500
 It's really interesting that this word

1088
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,420
 is repeated more in the gospel, a lot more,

1089
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,100
 multiple times more in the gospel of Mark

1090
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,040
 than anywhere else.

1091
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,840
 Eutheos, it shows 40 times in Mark.

1092
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,300
 We see the word, eutheos.

1093
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:36,460
 The Greek word, eutheos, translated in Luke 14, verse five,

1094
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,080
 as straightaway or immediately,

1095
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,780
 is the most characteristic word of Mark's gospel.

1096
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,500
 It is found more often in Mark

1097
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,800
 than in all other gospels combined.

1098
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,060
 Wow.

1099
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,260
 The reason is as follows.

1100
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,220
 Tradition identifies Mark as the rich man

1101
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,060
 to whom Jesus said that in order to be perfect,

1102
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:58,660
 he should sell everything he had and give to the poor.

1103
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,380
 It seemed to him that at that time, too big of a price,

1104
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,140
 and he left the place with sadness.

1105
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,940
 Later, he repented and fulfilled the commandment of the Lord

1106
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,780
 and there remained remorse in his heart

1107
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,620
 for the time lost in disobedience.

1108
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,940
 Therefore, he repeats continually in his gospel

1109
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:16,620
 the word, eutheos, straightaway, immediately.

1110
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:20,900
 What is good must be done straightaway, immediately.

1111
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,520
 Only this moment is ours.

1112
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,100
 The next moment might belong to death,

1113
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:29,420
 even if we are young and in perfect health.

1114
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,780
 So maybe you're here and you're like,

1115
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,220
 one day, one day I'm gonna tap out.

1116
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,620
 One day I'm gonna surrender.

1117
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,420
 One day I'm gonna give it all up.

1118
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,700
 That's how I was.

1119
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,860
 I mean, I was raised in church my whole life.

1120
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,420
 Right?

1121
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,780
 But I stumbled into this place

1122
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,460
 and this guy told this story about this horse.

1123
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,140
 It's such a silly story, but I was like hungover,

1124
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,900
 had a headache from the night before at a club, you know?

1125
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,900
 And he just talks about this horse

1126
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,300
 that just wanted to be free.

1127
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,780
 And in his desire for freedom,

1128
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,700
 he had to hunt for food and hunt for water

1129
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,060
 and find shelter from the elements

1130
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:03,900
 and all these people were trying

1131
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,620
 to capture this beast of a stallion.

1132
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:09,780
 One day there was a drought in the land

1133
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,980
 and the horse got weak and a cowboy successfully

1134
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:15,580
 came alongside it and got a rope around his neck.

1135
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,280
 He took it home and he put it in a fence,

1136
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,260
 but he loved him and he cared for him and provided for him.

1137
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,500
 He broke him.

1138
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:26,580
 The horse surrendered to him.

1139
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,020
 He was able to lead him to food and lead him to water.

1140
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,060
 And it was this line right here

1141
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,020
 where the Holy Spirit just rushed into my heart.

1142
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:36,800
 It wasn't until he was fully submissive to his master

1143
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,460
 that he truly experienced freedom for the first time.

1144
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,600
 Okay?

1145
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,420
 That is the paradox of the Christian faith.

1146
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,740
 That freedom comes through submission

1147
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:51,280
 and victory through surrender.

1148
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,700
 That's what's crazy about Christianity.

1149
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,540
 Let me say it again.

1150
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,220
 Freedom comes through submission

1151
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,580
 and victory comes through surrender.

1152
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,580
 That when you, it's like, hand up, winner!

1153
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,620
 You get a kingdom!

1154
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:05,540
 That's different, man.

1155
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,300
 You don't see that anywhere in the world.

1156
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,400
 That when you're like,

1157
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,340
 if you're at this place,

1158
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,400
 especially like if you were one through nine

1159
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,380
 on that little exercise, which hundreds of you were, right?

1160
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,220
 If that's where you were,

1161
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,060
 you were one through nine on that exercise

1162
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:22,900
 and you just like wanna surrender,

1163
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:23,740
 you just do it right here.

1164
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,540
 Just go, tap out.

1165
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,820
 Just like, hey, I'm all in.

1166
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,300
 And if you're at this place, right?

1167
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,380
 And this is, I'm speaking to all of you now.

1168
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,220
 Where you're like, you know,

1169
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,460
 I just realized there's parts of my life

1170
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,860
 that I haven't surrendered.

1171
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,920
 Would you just do that?

1172
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,060
 Would you just tap out right now?

1173
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,380
 You can just do it right now in this place.

1174
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,940
 Just say, all right, I'm tapping out.

1175
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:42,780
 I'm tapping out.

1176
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,380
 Okay?

1177
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,440
 Does anybody here just wanna surrender everything to him?

1178
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,780
 Jesus' place, you're like, you know what?

1179
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,620
 This is my moment.

1180
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,880
 I wanna surrender everything to him.

1181
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,100
 Is anybody in that place?

1182
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,140
 There's gonna be a moment.

1183
00:50:59,140 --> 00:50:59,980
 You're in that place.

1184
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:00,800
 Stand up for me, sir.

1185
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,420
 Glad, thank you for being here.

1186
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,420
 Yeah, you're in that place too?

1187
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,380
 Thank you.

1188
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,620
 Anybody else in that place?

1189
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,860
 (congregation applauding)

1190
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,860
 You're in that place too?

1191
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,140
 Praise God.

1192
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:13,960
 Praise God.

1193
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,300
 You guys stay standing 'cause we're about to move

1194
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,900
 into singing and I'm just gonna pray over you.

1195
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,460
 Anybody else I need to pray over?

1196
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,540
 You're at that place where, hey, I just wanna,

1197
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,460
 I see you up there.

1198
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,660
 I see you guys up there, right?

1199
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,020
 Anybody else, you're right there?

1200
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:23,860
 I'm just gonna pray over you.

1201
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,700
 You're in this place, you're like, man,

1202
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,520
 I just wanna surrender.

1203
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,060
 I know it takes courage to stand up

1204
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,540
 and it feels like everybody's looking at me,

1205
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,180
 but this is a, what in a way to end the conference

1206
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:32,020
 at this place where it's like,

1207
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,360
 I just wanna surrender everything.

1208
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,200
 I wanna surrender.

1209
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,180
 I wanna go all in with Jesus.

1210
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,260
 I'm ready to surrender my life to him.

1211
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:42,680
 I believe on the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ

1212
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,700
 for the forgiveness of my sins and nothing else.

1213
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,220
 Father in heaven.

1214
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,300
 Father in heaven.

1215
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,260
 Father in heaven.

1216
00:51:53,260 --> 00:52:00,160
 Father in heaven, have mercy on us.

1217
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:06,260
 We know that you sent Jesus to die for our sins

1218
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,220
 and we needed him because we've sinned.

1219
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,180
 We've ran from you, God.

1220
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:13,760
 We've done what we wanted to do.

1221
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,940
 You know all the sins.

1222
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,900
 The enemy wants to rub our face in them,

1223
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,620
 help us to just do jujitsu.

1224
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:22,060
 You're like, yeah, I did it, but Jesus died for it.

1225
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,140
 Help us to know that.

1226
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,880
 At a heart level, help us to believe that.

1227
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,220
 Even the believers in the room,

1228
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:31,980
 like we need the gospel preached to our heart every day.

1229
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,300
 Help us to know that.

1230
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:38,340
 Father, would you turn our hearts to you?

1231
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,180
 Help us to see the cross

1232
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:42,460
 that you sent him to die for our sins,

1233
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,820
 that you raised him from the dead, defeating death,

1234
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:47,100
 giving us the hope of eternal life.

1235
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:51,060
 And Father, we love you so much.

1236
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:53,540
 We love you so much.

1237
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,700
 Thank you for all that you're doing in this place,

1238
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,060
 for the way that you're at work in this place.

1239
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:02,540
 Thank you for the fun that we've had,

1240
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,380
 the laughter that we've had.

1241
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,260
 Forgive us for our sins, protect us from evil.

1242
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,220
 Lead us not into temptation, God,

1243
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,220
 but deliver us from the enemy.

1244
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:14,940
 If he seeks to tempt us, help us to stand strong

1245
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,100
 by the power of your Holy Spirit.

1246
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,180
 We leave our sins in this room

1247
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,840
 like they were left in the tomb.

1248
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:26,540
 We go back to our lives different, new,

1249
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:30,420
 a reflection of you and who you are and all you've done.

1250
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:36,020
 In the name of your Son, Jesus Christ, amen.

1251
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,180
 - Amen. - Amen.
