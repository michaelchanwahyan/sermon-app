[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [Music]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.020]   [Music]
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.020]   [Music]
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.020]   Porsche, let me hear from you, how we feeling tonight?
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.020]   Yeah, let's go.
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.040]   Hey, I have thought about it over the course of the last week
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.040]   and I think I am in on this Tuesday thing.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.040]   I think I will keep coming back week after week.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.040]   How do y'all feel?
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.040]   Y'all feel good about that?
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.040]   Hey, we have some very special friends joining us, not only
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.040]   here in Dallas but also from around the nation.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.060]   We have some friends tuning in, Porsche Live locations, Boise,
[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.060]   Indy, Greater Lafayette.
[00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.060]   So glad you are jumping in with us tonight.
[00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.060]   Hey, I am excited for this evening.
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.060]   I am excited to continue our series ins and outs.
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.060]   But before we get into the meat of what we have for tonight, I
[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.060]   want to start off with a simple question.
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.060]   But I need your participation.
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.060]   So quick show of hands.
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.080]   Who in the room wants to find fulfillment in life?
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.080]   Show of hands.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.080]   Show of hands.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.080]   Show of hands.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.080]   Keep them up.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.080]   Keep them up.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.080]   Now just take a look around.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.080]   Like what you see as you gaze around this room is it's all of
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.080]   us.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.080]   Like it's not just you.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.100]   You are not the exception in your pursuit of fulfillment.
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.100]   Everybody in this room is searching for it.
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.100]   Which reminds me of a story.
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.100]   It reminds me of the time that I lost my Aggie ring.
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.100]   So every Thanksgiving my family gets together and we play a
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.100]   backyard football game.
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100]   Anybody else do that with your families at Thanksgiving?
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.100]   We do this every single year.
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.120]   And over the course of the years the game has gotten increasingly
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.120]   competitive as my cousins and my nieces and nephews have gotten
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.120]   older.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.120]   And so we're playing this last year and what is happening is
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.120]   we're in the backyard and it's fourth quarter and my team is
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.120]   down a couple of scores.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.120]   And we're getting pretty heated.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.120]   And so I do the only sensible thing that an honest competitor
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.120]   would do.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.140]   I look at my 8-year-old nephew and I bench the guy.
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.140]   Hey, man, I have to play quarterback now.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.140]   You can't do this anymore.
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.140]   I need to do it instead.
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.140]   Because we have a stage to come back and we start doing it.
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.140]   Like I'm throwing passes, dishing the ball.
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.140]   We've got deep fades and out routes and stop and goes.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.160]   Like we're making our way back into the game until we're only
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160]   at the fourth and it's the final possession of the game.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.160]   And so knowing that we've got an opportunity here, my brother, he
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160]   streams down the left side of the field and I launch a ball
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.160]   his direction.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.180]   And in the process I launch my Aggie ring.
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.180]   Now in a moment like that you realize what you truly value in
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.180]   life.
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.180]   And what became immediately clear to me is that my ring meant way
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.180]   more to me than that game.
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.180]   Because I immediately shut the thing down.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.180]   Stop!
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.180]   Like no more.
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.180]   We can't play.
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.180]   And I recruited my entire family to help.
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.180]   Help!
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.200]   Like everybody get over here.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   Oh, my God, what happened to you?
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   I lost my Aggie ring.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   Okay.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.200]   I'm sure it's around here somewhere.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   Don't worry.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.200]   And so we go through the process of walking the yard and just
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.200]   trying to see if we can find it.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   No luck.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   And so we get strategic.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.220]   We get together and we form a line and we start to sweep the
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.220]   yard together to see if we can find the ring.
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.220]   Still nothing.
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.220]   And so I then make everybody get on their hands and knees and
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.240]   scour through the grass trying to see if they can pick out my
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.240]   ring, my Nana included.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.240]   It's still nothing.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.240]   Like we had no luck whatsoever.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.240]   And so I can feel like the cold chill of panic, like a wet
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.240]   blanket just falling over me.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.240]   That I'm not going to find this thing until I realize I still
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.240]   had one, one more solution in my back pocket.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.240]   I could go buy a metal detector.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.240]   So I did.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.260]   I got in my pickup.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260]   I drove to academy and I got one off the shelf.
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260]   Immediately ran back home.
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.260]   Unboxed that thing.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.260]   Started working through the intricacies of treasure hunting
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.260]   and started making my way across the yard to find my Aggie ring.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260]   And you know what I found?
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260]   Gold.
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260]   Because here it is.
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.280]   Now why do I tell you that?
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.280]   Because I think a lot of us are searching for fulfillment in
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   the same way.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.280]   Like we're moving through the proverbial backyard of 2024 and
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.280]   we're on the hunt for fulfillment.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.300]   And now we may be varied in our intensity during that hunt.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.300]   And yet nonetheless we're still looking for fulfillment.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.300]   The reason I know this is the case is because last week we
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.300]   talked about how statistically the research shows this year we
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.300]   are in for three things.
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.300]   We are in for self-acceptance, self-fulfillment and
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.320]   self-reliance.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.320]   And so this is something that we have prescribed as being the top
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.320]   of our list.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.320]   This is what we are in for more than anything else.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.320]   So if this is what we're hunting down, it begs the question.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.320]   How do we find it?
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.320]   Well, how do you find anything in life?
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.320]   You ask someone that's found it before.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.340]   Right now I'm on the great mission of figuring out what the
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.340]   best Mexican food restaurant is in Dallas, Texas.
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.340]   If you have any recommendations, come talk to me afterwards.
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.340]   But I'm asking the question.
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.340]   I'm talking to my team.
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.340]   I'm trying to understand where is the best Mexican food in the
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.340]   area.
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.340]   And the reason why I'm asking them is they have already
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.340]   gathered the insights that can help me to learn quicker where
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.360]   to go.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.360]   They know better than I do.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.360]   You see, personal experience isn't the best teacher.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.360]   Someone else's experience is.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.360]   Why should I spend the money when they've already spent it?
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.360]   I'm trying to ask them how do I find what it is I'm looking for?
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.360]   What we see tonight in Psalm 73 is the story of a guy that
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.360]   actually did find fulfillment.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.360]   He goes by the name of Asaph.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.380]   Asaph is a worship leader.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.380]   He was appointed by David as the worship leader over the
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.380]   tabernacle choir.
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.380]   And what we see as we jump into Psalm 73 is he knows how to
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.380]   find fulfillment.
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.380]   But he doesn't know how to find fulfillment.
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.380]   It's not where we might be expecting.
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.400]   If you have a Bible, turn with me to Psalm 73.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.400]   If this is your first time, I alluded to it but we're in a
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.400]   brand-new series called Ins and Outs.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   What we know about this series, we're asking the question, do my
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.400]   goals line up with God's will for my life?
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.400]   Here's what you need to know.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.400]   Cards on the table up front.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:30.420]   He's just in on you finding it somewhere specific.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.420]   Psalm 73, this is what it says, starting in verse 1.
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.420]   It says...
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.420]   Right out of the gate it's pretty clear, our guy Asaph, he
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.420]   isn't fulfilled.
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.420]   He's discontent.
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.420]   He feels some sense of frustration.
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.420]   It says so in verse 1.
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.420]   He says...
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.420]   He starts praying, God is good.
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.420]   But then he gets honest.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.420]   And he says...
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:17.420]   You see, Asaph, he knows that God is good.
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.420]   He has no doubt in his mind that God is in fact good.
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.420]   The question for Asaph is whether or not God is good to
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.420]   him.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.420]   This is the question in Asaph's mind.
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.420]   In verse 2 it says...
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.420]   He looks around and you know what he sees?
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.420]   What so many of us see.
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.420]   Everybody else has everything they want.
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.420]   They've attained and achieved and amassed for themselves all of
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.420]   the things that they want in life.
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.420]   Asaph feels that way.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.420]   Even for the wicked.
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:09.420]   And yet it doesn't feel like that's the case for him.
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.420]   That could not be further from his reality.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.420]   You see Asaph is going through the ancient equivalent of a
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.420]   quarter-life crisis.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.420]   What some of us are familiar with.
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.420]   And psychologists define as a period of uncertainty and
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.420]   questioning that typically occurs when people feel trapped.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.420]   Uninspired.
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.420]   And disillusioned during their 20s and 30s.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.420]   This is a feeling some of you can relate to.
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.420]   Like you graduated college.
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.420]   You moved to the big city.
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.420]   You got the job you wanted.
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.420]   You got the big checks and you picked up the guy or the girl
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.420]   you were aiming at and you started living in the high rise
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.420]   and everything looks the way you wanted.
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.420]   And yet on the other side of it you woke up one day and you
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.420]   realized this isn't at all as fulfilling as I thought it would
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.420]   be.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.420]   I'm not nearly as satisfied with all of the trappings of a
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.420]   successful life like I thought I would be.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.420]   I feel empty.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.420]   Does that sound like your experience?
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.420]   This is Asaph's.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.420]   This is what he's feeling.
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.420]   He's saying, man, I played by the rules.
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.420]   I've checked all the boxes.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.420]   I've crossed the T's and done everything the way you're
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.420]   supposed to do it and yet I'm still missing something.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.420]   He feels frustrated.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.420]   He feels out of gas.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:36.420]   He feels winded from all the work.
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.420]   He feels disappointed.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.420]   Which is good.
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.420]   You may not be thinking that that is the case.
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.420]   And yet what we know in order to find fulfillment is we actually
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.420]   have to first and foremost identify what triggers our
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.420]   disappointment.
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.420]   If you want to find fulfillment, you must identify what triggers
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.420]   your disappointment.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.420]   At first that feels like a bait and switch.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:07.420]   Dude, I came here expecting to meet some people and have a
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.420]   great evening and spend time with my friends and here you talk
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.420]   about fulfillment.
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.420]   Sounds like an awesome night.
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.420]   And now you're talking about disappointment.
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.420]   So glad I came.
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.420]   Here's why we need to talk about disappointment before we get
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.420]   into fulfillment.
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:31.420]   Because in order to figure out how to make something right, you
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.420]   must first understand why it is wrong.
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.420]   Like you can't make something right unless you first know
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.420]   what's wrong.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.420]   This is why it's really important, fellas.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.420]   If you're trying to date a beautiful young lady, you need
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:51.420]   to listen to her whenever you've upset her.
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:56.420]   Listen to her as in comprehend the words she's speaking.
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.420]   Because she's telling you, hey, this is what's wrong.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.420]   That way you can make it right.
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.420]   You can't simply do it by way of offering flowers, buying
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.420]   chocolates, taking to dinner.
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.420]   You have to understand, comprehend what is wrong in the
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.420]   situation before you can effectively make it right.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.420]   Author Brene Brown said really well, disappointment is unmet
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.420]   expectations.
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.420]   And the more significant the expectations, the more
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.420]   significant the disappointment.
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.420]   It's kind of like the idea of an appetite.
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.420]   Like when you get hungry, what's the natural response?
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.420]   To find some food.
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.420]   Which you expect to find because you went to the grocery store
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.420]   and stocked up like a responsible young adult.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.420]   How do you feel when you swing open the pantry and nothing is
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.420]   in there because your roommate ate all of it?
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.420]   You're triggered.
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.420]   That's what happens.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.420]   You immediately become disappointed.
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.420]   Like you had expectations of what would be there and yet
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.420]   those expectations didn't pan out.
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.420]   So you go from hungry to hangry.
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.420]   You turn into a monster.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.420]   You become a different person.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.420]   And yet it's sensible because a discouraged heart produces a
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.420]   distorted perspective.
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.420]   Like your outlook on life, it becomes bleak because your
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.420]   expectations have gone unmet.
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.420]   So how do we know what's discouraged our heart?
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.420]   How do we identify what triggers our disappointment?
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.420]   What source is behind our discontentment in life?
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.420]   How do we figure that out?
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.420]   Look at verse 3.
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.420]   For I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.420]   prosperity of the wicked.
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.420]   For they have no pangs until death.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.420]   Their bodies are fat and sleek.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.420]   They're not in trouble as others are.
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.420]   They're not stricken like the rest of mankind.
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.420]   Friends, if you want to identify what triggers your
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:57.420]   disappointment, then you need to recognize what evokes your envy.
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.420]   If you want to identify what triggers your disappointment,
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.420]   then you need to recognize what evokes your envy.
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:09.420]   If you want to identify what triggers your disappointment,
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.420]   then you need to recognize what evokes your envy.
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.420]   This is what happens for Asaph.
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.420]   Like his struggle with discontentment, it started the
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.420]   minute he looked away from God and started looking at everybody
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.420]   else around.
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:30.420]   And what you find is he just starts -- he starts casually
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.420]   scrolling on ancient Instagram.
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.420]   And he finds, man, hey, the prosperity of the wicked.
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.420]   They're wealthier than me.
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.420]   They have no pangs until death.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.420]   They're healthier than me.
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.420]   Their bodies are fat and sleek.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.420]   They're prettier than I am.
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.420]   They lack any kind of trouble.
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.420]   They're smarter than me.
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.420]   He saw they weren't stricken like the rest of mankind.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.420]   They're happier than me.
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.420]   You think the Bible reads relevantly?
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.420]   Like Asaph deals here with what you deal there.
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:05.420]   He's wrestling with feelings of insecurity and inadequacy and
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.420]   insufficiency.
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.420]   No different than we do.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.420]   The problems are the same.
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.420]   But that's good news because the solutions are too.
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:19.420]   You see what happens to Asaph, which happens to so many of us,
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:24.420]   is we walk unknowingly into the trap of comparison.
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.420]   Teddy Roosevelt, he famously said that comparison is a thief
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.420]   of joy.
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:33.420]   And when he was in the plane, turned that up a notch, he said
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.420]   that comparison is the death of joy.
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.420]   And the Bible has its own spin.
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.420]   In Proverbs 14.30 it says...
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:54.420]   The Bible wants you to know comparison is toxic to joy.
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.420]   It rots the bones.
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.420]   That's the nature.
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:03.420]   It's more than just looking and wanting what other people have.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.420]   It's resenting them for it.
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.420]   They have what I want.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.420]   And so I hate them.
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.420]   I want so badly to be where they are.
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.420]   And so I resent them.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.420]   This is what happens to us whenever we take our eyes off of
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.420]   God and lay them upon other people.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.420]   We stop looking for fulfillment in the right places.
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:31.420]   And what we find is disappointment instead.
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.420]   Friends, if you want to find fulfillment, then first you need
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.420]   to identify what triggers your disappointment.
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.420]   Where are you bitter in life?
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.420]   Like what consumes your head space?
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.420]   Even tonight.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.420]   Because you walked in.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.420]   What's clouding your judgment?
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.420]   Blurring your vision?
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.420]   That's what Asaph does.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.420]   He tries to understand himself.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:59.420]   He wants to get under the layers of why is it that I'm so
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.420]   embittered against all of these other people.
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.420]   And so he says in verse 16...
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.420]   But when I thought of how to understand this, it seemed to be
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.420]   a wearisome task.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:16.420]   Until I went into the sanctuary of God.
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.420]   Then I discerned their end.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.420]   Truly you set them in slippery places, you make them fall to
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.420]   ruin.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.420]   How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away utterly by
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.420]   terror.
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.420]   Like a dream when one awakes, oh, Lord, when you rouse yourself
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.420]   you despise them as phantoms.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.420]   You are shrewd and ignorant.
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.420]   I was like a beast towards you.
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.420]   The second step towards finding fulfillment after you identify
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.420]   what triggers your disappointment is you have to
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.420]   keep eternity in perspective.
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.420]   You have to keep eternity in perspective.
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.420]   It's interesting.
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.420]   When you go and you study through Psalm 73, you'll find
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:57.420]   that it actually breaks down in a mirror form.
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.420]   It's what scholars call a chiastic structure.
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.420]   The first half of the psalm mirrors the second half of the
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.420]   psalm.
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.420]   The first half of the psalm talks about Asaph's old
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.420]   perspective on life and the second half talks about his new
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.420]   perspective on life.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.420]   And any time you see a chiasm, the way you understand what the
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.420]   main point or one of the most significant elements of that
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.420]   psalm or that narrative or that epistle is, the way that you
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.420]   learn is you look at the hinge point.
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.420]   What's the dead center of it?
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.420]   That's verse 16.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:33.420]   And what it says in verse 16 is that Asaph went into the
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.420]   sanctuary of God.
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.420]   That's what changed his perspective.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.420]   That's what solved his disappointment.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.420]   He got close to God.
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.420]   Psalm 97 says...
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:57.420]   Just take that into consideration.
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.420]   The mountains melt like wax.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:04.420]   Like Everest in all of its glory and greatness.
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.420]   Melts away the minute God shows up.
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.420]   Like the transcendence of God.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:15.420]   It waxes away our greatest disappointments.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.420]   This is what Asaph learns.
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.420]   He learns that God's presence, it brings new perspective.
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.420]   Like his disappointments, they had hypnotized him into
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.420]   thinking all hope is lost.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:30.420]   And the minute he gets close to God, he snaps out of it.
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.420]   He realizes it's not as bad as I thought.
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.420]   Things are not as grim as they seemed.
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.420]   Because with God what you learn is that the realization of what
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.420]   you want pales in comparison to the reminder of what you
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.420]   already have.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.420]   The realization, the attainment, the achievement of what you
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.420]   want, it pales in comparison to the reminder of what you
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.420]   already have.
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.420]   Namely who you already have.
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.420]   Like this is what Asaph does.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.420]   He looks forward.
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.420]   He considers the future.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.420]   Verse 17 says...
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.420]   That's a long ways out.
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.420]   He starts thinking about how all of this plays out in eternity.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.420]   And you know what it gives him?
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.420]   The minute he adopts an eternal perspective, it gives him
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.420]   clarity.
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.420]   It gives him clarity.
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.420]   Clarity specifically about those he envies.
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.420]   That they're set in slippery places.
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.420]   That unless they come to know God, they will fall to ruin.
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.420]   And then it's gone.
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.420]   The next.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.420]   And he also gets clarity about the condition of his own heart.
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.420]   He realizes and honestly admits...
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.420]   When my soul was in bitter.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.420]   When it was.
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.420]   Past tense.
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.420]   When I was pricked in heart.
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.420]   I was brutish.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.420]   And ignorant.
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:47.420]   I was like a beast towards you.
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.420]   Asaph acknowledges.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.420]   I was ignorant.
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.420]   I was like a beast.
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.420]   I didn't understand.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.420]   I thought that fulfillment was found in all of these other
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.420]   places.
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.420]   I thought it was found in my job and in my relationship.
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.420]   And in my family being healthy with one another.
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.420]   I thought it was going to be found in a vibrant community
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.420]   here at Watermark.
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.420]   And yet what I learned is fulfillment is not found in any
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.420]   of those things.
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.420]   It's found in you, God.
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:20.420]   Fulfillment is found in you.
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.420]   Friends, in the same way that Asaph,
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.420]   he uses an eternal perspective to deconstruct his
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.420]   disappointment.
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.420]   We have to do the same thing.
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.420]   Like we have to get underneath our disappointment and
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.420]   understand, man, why does this bother me so much?
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.420]   And how can I be restored to hope?
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.420]   That way I can find fulfillment.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.420]   And the way you do it is you lock your eyes on God.
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.420]   You fix your gaze on him.
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.420]   Just like Davy said.
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.420]   You look to Jesus.
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.420]   You get your eyes locked upon his goodness.
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.420]   And you allow that to inform the way that you see the watching
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.420]   world.
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.420]   Lamentations 3, 37-38, it tells us why this is valuable.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.420]   Why when we look to God he can be trusted.
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.420]   It says...
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:15.420]   So friends, to the disappointment you feel because
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.420]   you're not as far along as you want to be in life.
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.420]   An eternal perspective would look at that and say,
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.420]   my God is good.
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.420]   And his plans are in fact better for my life than my own.
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:31.420]   Like to the disappointment you feel because it keeps feeling
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.420]   like God is unnecessarily complicating your life.
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.420]   An eternal perspective looks at that and says,
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.420]   my God is kind.
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.420]   And with him my pain is never pointless.
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.420]   But always has purpose.
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.420]   And to the disappointment you feel because the world has led
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.420]   you to believe you're not enough.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.420]   You're not pretty enough, smart enough, funny enough,
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.420]   popular enough, likeable enough, desirable enough.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.420]   You'll never be successful enough.
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.420]   To all of that, an eternal perspective says,
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:04.420]   my God is perfect.
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.420]   And I'm nothing less than he wants me to be today.
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:12.420]   I'm exactly who and exactly where he wants me to be.
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.420]   I'm exactly who and exactly where he wants me right now.
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.420]   We're going to move forward.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.420]   We're going to get better.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.420]   But that happens as I walk with him.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:24.420]   Not because the world tells me so.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:30.420]   Listen, if God is withholding some things from you,
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:34.420]   it's because he wants something else for you.
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.420]   If God is withholding some things from you,
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.420]   it's because he wants something different for you.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:46.420]   Namely, more of himself.
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:54.420]   I guarantee you, he always wants more of himself for you.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.420]   This is the story of the scriptures.
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.420]   This is what the entire Bible is pointing to.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:03.420]   God wanting to be close, near and known by us.
[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.420]   He will always work for that.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.420]   And that's exactly what Asaph finds.
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.420]   As you keep reading, it says in verse 23...
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.420]   Asaph gets close to God and his perspective changes.
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.420]   It shifts.
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:43.420]   And what he finds is that God is continually with him.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.420]   Holding him by his right hand.
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:49.420]   Guiding him with counsel and ready to receive him into glory.
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:53.420]   You see, even when Asaph had lost sight of God,
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.420]   God never lost sight of him.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:25:00.420]   Even when Asaph walked away and moved towards the world,
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:04.420]   God stayed exactly where he was last left.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.420]   The same is true for you.
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.420]   God has not walked away from you.
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.420]   God has not abandoned you.
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.420]   He's not overlooked you.
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.420]   He's not forgotten about you.
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.420]   And some of you feel like the exception to that rule tonight.
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.420]   And yet that could not be further from the truth.
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.420]   God, he sees you as you are.
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:28.420]   And he's wanting you exactly as you are tonight.
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.420]   This is the Lord's heart.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.420]   Asaph comes back and he says, God, you're still here.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.420]   You never left.
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.420]   I thought you forgot about me.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.420]   But God, you didn't.
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.420]   You stayed here the entire time.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.420]   I walked off and I got distracted by the world.
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:50.420]   I allowed the strength of my heart and my portion to be fulfilled by other things in life.
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.420]   Like I thought the strength of my job would fulfill me, God.
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.420]   But it didn't.
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.420]   I thought the strength of my relationship would fulfill me.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.420]   I thought the strength of my good reputation would fulfill me.
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.420]   But God, none of those things did.
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.420]   You're my portion.
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.420]   You're my portion.
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:08.420]   Not just today and not just tomorrow and not just the day after that or the week following, the month after that.
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:14.420]   You're my portion forever.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.420]   You never left me, God.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:26.420]   Which is why I now know that I depend on you for the fulfillment I seek.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.420]   And that's the third point.
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:35.420]   If you want to find it, you must depend on God for the fulfillment you seek.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:45.420]   You see, fulfillment in life is found through contentment in God.
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.420]   That's what Asaph is writing in Psalm 73.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.420]   That's what he wants you to take away tonight.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.420]   It's not something you achieve.
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.420]   It's something you receive from the Lord.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.420]   Which I know really bothers some of us.
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:04.420]   Like we were talking as a staff earlier, but tell them what they need to do to get it.
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.420]   That's not how contentment works.
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.420]   That's not what you do.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:15.420]   Contentment is a satisfaction not in doing for the Lord but in being with the Lord.
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:21.420]   It's in registering not what I don't have but in what I do.
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:26.420]   That God, you're all I need.
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.420]   And so I can wait with you.
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.420]   I can sit with you.
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.420]   I can listen to you.
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:35.420]   I can come close to you, God.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:42.420]   You see, the reason why I think that bothers us so much is because we've mistaken what fulfillment actually is.
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:50.420]   You see, when we talk about searching for fulfillment, often what I think we're looking for is something full of feeling.
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:54.420]   We've mistaken fulfillment as something full of feeling.
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.420]   And that's not what it is.
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:03.420]   Like we think that, man, I've got to find something that's going to gratify and satisfy every need in my life.
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:08.420]   And so what we do is we start looking for ways to achieve that end.
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.420]   We want a nicer job.
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.420]   We want better friends.
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.420]   We want another beer.
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.420]   We decide that we need to take another trip.
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.420]   Like we do all of these things.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.420]   And here's the thing that's so tricky about it.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.420]   This is what the enemy loves to do in our life.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:26.420]   He loves to scratch the itch.
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:30.420]   So that way you come back for more.
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:35.420]   He wants you to find some sense of satisfaction.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:41.420]   But once it wears away, return like a dog to its vomit.
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.420]   This is what the enemy wants.
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:48.420]   And yet what the Lord wants is he wants to satisfy you not just today but forever.
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.420]   And this is God's heart.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:54.420]   You see, Paul, he talks about this in Philippians 4.
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:57.420]   He says, I know what it is to be in need.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.420]   Like I know what it is to have plenty.
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:06.420]   Like he's saying I know what it's like to be empty inside and I know what it's like to be full inside physically.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:11.420]   I've learned a secret of being content in any and every situation.
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.420]   Whether I'm well fed or I'm hungry.
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.420]   Both ends of the spectrum.
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.420]   Whether I'm living in plenty or I'm living in want.
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.420]   Paul says that finding fulfillment is like learning a secret.
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:25.420]   And the secret is that fulfillment is found through contentment in God.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.420]   That's what he's pointing towards.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:29.420]   Psalm 34.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:38.420]   It says the young lions, which sound like young adults, they suffer want and hunger.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.420]   We want for so much.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:46.420]   But those who seek the Lord, they lack no good thing.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:58.420]   Translation, those who seek the Lord, those who are content with God are always fulfilled.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:03.420]   Friends, this has been heavy.
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:10.420]   But I didn't want to pull punches because I love you enough to speak what needs to be spoken.
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.420]   We are all looking for fulfillment in here.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.420]   We outed ourselves at the beginning of this night.
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.420]   If you're like, it doesn't apply to me.
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.420]   Sorry, it does.
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:25.420]   You admitted at the beginning of this thing that this talk is for you.
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.420]   And yet I love you enough to say this.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.420]   And I prayed earlier, God, should I?
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:40.420]   And I think it's right for me to say that if fulfillment is found through contentment in God.
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:50.420]   You are never more unfulfilled than you are tonight if you do not know Jesus.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:56.420]   Some of you are searching the world.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.420]   You're trying to find it.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:05.420]   And yet what you need to know is fulfillment can't be found.
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:13.420]   Because fulfillment found you.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.420]   Because Jesus Christ is God.
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:25.420]   Colossians 1.19 tells us...
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:30.420]   Jesus Christ is not only God, he also forgives sins.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:40.420]   John 1.16 says...
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:44.420]   But he's not only God and not only capable of forgiving sin.
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.420]   He also gives life.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:59.420]   Which is what it says in John 10.10...
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.420]   You need to know that you are not only seeking the fullness of God, you are seeking the fullness of the fullness of God.
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:07.420]   Friend, are you seeking for fulfillment tonight?
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:14.420]   Then you need to know fulfillment has already sought after you.
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:24.420]   You walked in here tonight no doubt frustrated, discontent, dissatisfied with your job, with your relationship, with whatever it may be.
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:28.420]   You fill in the blank.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:38.420]   But the truth you need to hear is the resolution of that problem will only leave you searching still.
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:52.420]   But the one that has resolved our greatest problem, our separation from God, he will fulfill you forever more.
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.420]   Do you know him?
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:33:03.420]   If you don't, then the fulfillment you seek is waiting in him.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:09.420]   If you do, then I would ask you the question...
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:15.420]   Are you living life or are you living it to the full?
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:28.420]   Because Jesus has not just come to save you from your sin, he has come to save you for so much more.
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:32.420]   Friends, Jesus is wanting for you.
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:36.420]   That's what this all says.
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:42.420]   The question is, how much of him do you want for yourself?
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.420]   Let me pray for us.
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:34:12.420]   (Praying)
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:21.420]   Father, there is no life apart from you.
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:25.420]   And there is no life worth living apart from you.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:38.420]   You God have come to give us life, but you've also come God to give us the fullness thereof.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:42.420]   I pray God we would know that this evening.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:50.420]   But not just know it intellectually God.
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:54.420]   But know it God deep into our bones.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:58.420]   Feel it God instinctively from within.
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:09.420]   And let it drive us God to pursue an intimacy with you forever.
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:18.420]   God I know what it's like to search the world and come up empty.
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:27.420]   I've run God that direction and I've found it to be so fruitless.
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:36.420]   Would you God by your spirit tonight speak to each and every one of us God in the way that only you can God.
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.420]   The way that you so distinctly can.
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:46.420]   Would you speak to us and say life is not found out there, it's found right here.
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:51.420]   You will not find joy elsewhere.
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.420]   You'll find joy right here.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.420]   Come to me, come to me, come home to me.
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:04.420]   I've never left you, I've never lost you, I've never forsaken you, I've waited for you all along.
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:06.420]   Come back to me God.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.420]   I pray we would respond to that call tonight.
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:14.420]   Believer and those that do not believe God.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:22.420]   I pray like let this evening God be one where we awaken to the reality that there is no life that is fulfilling apart from you God.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:29.420]   No, in fact, we've never lived more unfulfilled than when we're apart from you God.
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:40.420]   And so quicken our feet, incline our hearts, inspire God our souls and draw us back to the one thing that matters.
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.420]   It's you God.
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:49.420]   It's you like you've come God to save us from sin but to new life.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:54.420]   You God, you're the one that gives a life and a life worth living.
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:37:04.420]   Fulfillment is nowhere else to be found but only found right here.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:15.420]   Friends, if you're in the room tonight and you do not know Jesus Christ,
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:22.420]   with just a loving urgency, I want to look at you and say,
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:29.420]   everything you're searching for, it's found in him and him alone.
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:36.420]   If you want to place your faith in Jesus, if you want to declare him as Lord of your life and receive the free gift of salvation,
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:44.420]   that gift which saves you from your sin and your eternal separation from God but brings you close to the source of life,
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:47.420]   all you have to do is receive it.
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.420]   That's the beauty of the good news.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:53.420]   It's a gift.
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:38:02.420]   For others of us here tonight, we may hear this and it may feel like old news.
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:09.420]   But I want to remind you it's still good news.
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:15.420]   Restore to me the joy of your salvation, God.
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:19.420]   And let me burst forth, God, in the praise that you deserve.
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:26.420]   Father, we give these next moments to you and we pray, use them as you may.
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.420]   It's in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:39.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
