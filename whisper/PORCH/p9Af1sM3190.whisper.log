[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.560]   - Well, good evening friends here in Dallas
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.000]   and Fort Worth, Houston and around the country
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.820]   as you listen in.
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.060]   It's so great to be with you tonight.
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.100]   If we've never met before, my name is Garrett.
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.360]   I typically spend my Tuesday nights
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.460]   about 40 miles west over in Fort Worth.
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.800]   I don't know if you knew this.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.800]   Somebody knew that.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.540]   And so I don't know if the rest of you,
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.400]   the majority knew this,
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.480]   but there's an invisible section of seats
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.360]   that's here every single Tuesday.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.160]   And it's just a little bit west of here in Fort Worth
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.920]   that meets over in the Ridgely Theater.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.480]   I actually wanna start tonight by telling you a story
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.320]   about something that happened there about three weeks ago.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.880]   Three weeks ago, three or four weeks ago now,
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.600]   I lose count, January 26th, a few weeks ago.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.080]   Oh my gosh, we're up to five or six weeks now.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.120]   January 26th was the first porch of the year.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.960]   And so we take off around Christmas break.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.520]   And so there's like a six, seven week break.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.840]   Some of you kind of get a little antsy
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.760]   because it's time for porch to start back up again.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.600]   And so that starts to happen a little bit.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.360]   And then finally on January 26th,
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.480]   we load up and we're ready for the first porch of 2016.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.480]   Something you wanna know about the experience in Fort Worth.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.920]   We typically stream the message.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.060]   By stream, I mean it comes through on the internet
[00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.920]   on a flat screen.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.720]   So whoever's in three dimensions with you here in Dallas
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.080]   is in two dimensions over in Fort Worth on the screen.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.520]   All right, and so that's what's normal.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.920]   That is obviously dependent on technology.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.480]   So January 26th, we all load up in the Ridgely Theater.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.960]   No exaggeration, I just want you to feel
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.180]   for what that moment was like.
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.100]   Seven weeks of pent up energy, lots of excitement.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.900]   We're all ready to go.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.640]   Just so that you know, there's more people in the theater
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.360]   than we've ever had on a Tuesday night before.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.360]   It's very exciting.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.560]   And so the stream comes on.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.720]   We move through the worship set.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.560]   So there's a band there that leads us live
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.920]   and worship there in Fort Worth.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.480]   And we move through the worship set.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.680]   And then on comes the stream, the sermon time.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.700]   And it has no audio.
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.680]   So there's no sound coming.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.160]   It's like JP's mouth is moving
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.480]   and you can tell it's animated.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.980]   I mean, there's this going on.
[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.920]   And so that's happening.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.200]   And so we're watching 1920s movie kind of thing.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   And then, but good news, we have a backup.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.920]   And so I left my seat and I kind of went back
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.840]   to the AV booth to see how my friends were doing.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.280]   And so we switched to the backup feed.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.480]   And wouldn't you know, it's also dependent on technology.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.100]   And so that one starts to click, click,
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.520]   it goes off, black screen.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.800]   And you hear an audible, oh.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.640]   (congregation laughing)
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.320]   And my friend who serves on the AV team,
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.860]   who has an answer for everything on this one,
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.980]   his answer was to look up.
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.340]   He looked at me, we made eye contact.
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.220]   It felt like an hour.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.820]   I know it was a two second interaction.
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.100]   And he said, you're on.
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.940]   And he pointed to the stage.
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.380]   I'm like, oh boy.
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.700]   Okay, so I got between here and the stage
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.460]   to come up with something.
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.620]   And I just wanna tell you,
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.560]   we were together for a normal 35 minute sermon.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.360]   And the best part about that sermon is that it's over.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.620]   (congregation laughing)
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.220]   You're not gonna find that sermon anywhere.
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.180]   It's not on the podcast.
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.980]   It's like not in the resource center.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.820]   It's not on the app.
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.300]   You can look for it, like it won't be there.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.140]   It's done.
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.740]   And so we did survive.
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.780]   We did make it.
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.860]   And my countenance personally,
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.780]   as this was going on was just a sense of dependence.
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.060]   Like, okay, God, I mean,
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.860]   who could be in control of this except you?
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.020]   We've got great technology.
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.140]   We've got the best and brightest personnel
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.740]   that you can possibly imagine
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.060]   that put this thing together.
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.120]   And we were ready to go.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.060]   And so if something went wrong, it's gotta be you.
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.980]   And so that was kind of my posture.
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.900]   And then all of a sudden I came off,
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.620]   off of that moment, 10 o'clock hits,
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.180]   we locked the doors, I go home.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.940]   And my posture starts to change dramatically.
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.960]   Now, I just would want you to know this about me,
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.960]   honest confession.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.120]   I've sometimes been accused of being a little bit intense
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.980]   and kind of like, mm.
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.100]   And so you heard of type A?
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.300]   Like type A hole, okay,
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.700]   is like what I've been accused of every once in a while.
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.540]   And so.
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.960]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.940]   I'm just gonna be,
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.060]   I'm gonna start on the real foot with you guys.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.940]   I'm just gonna be honest.
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.140]   And so that, I have that downside.
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.500]   And so all of a sudden after the message,
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.940]   whereas I didn't feel like I needed answers beforehand,
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.780]   all we just needed to do,
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.100]   what was God wanted us to do,
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.940]   all of a sudden afterward,
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.420]   I felt like I really needed some answers.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.880]   I felt like, okay, was it man?
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.720]   Was it machine?
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.540]   Was it a mistake that someone made?
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.460]   Or was it a box that's broken?
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.380]   I mean, what's the deal?
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.340]   And so my need for answers continued to rise.
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.900]   And instead of all of a sudden feeling like the stream
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.220]   and the experience that we get every single Tuesday night,
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.140]   instead of remembering that that's a privilege,
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.060]   all of a sudden that itself and all the answers
[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.180]   that pertain to that particular situation
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.540]   started to feel like rights.
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.360]   Rights to me that I was losing and having to part with.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.220]   And so a couple of days later, this does not lift.
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.180]   This darkness does not lift.
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.140]   It's not from God, by the way.
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.060]   I'm not condoning this.
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.260]   I'm being honest with you.
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.220]   And so the next Wednesday was not a good day.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.940]   On Thursday morning, I'm driving over to work.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.900]   Again, and it still has not, I have still,
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.420]   what I've got from a team, which just to be clear,
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.660]   the team is best, brightest in the land,
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.980]   in the business, period.
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.320]   Like they're working on it.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.580]   That's what I'm getting is they're working on it,
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.000]   which should bring comfort.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.900]   But instead, I was so lost in my own entitlement
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.220]   to what I thought were rights, namely information,
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.100]   that I was so frustrated.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.900]   I got into a traffic jam on Thursday morning
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.780]   and I thought I was gonna be late.
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.220]   And the lateness doesn't normally bother me so much,
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.720]   but I felt my fist,
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.420]   I felt my hand form into a fist
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.540]   and I brought it down twice on my console
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.440]   and it was broken,
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.380]   which is why no one needs to interrupt this sermon tonight.
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.080]   I'm not kidding.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.140]   I broke my car.
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.740]   I literally, like my console was broken.
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.140]   Like the latch broke.
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.060]   I mean, one, two, the latch is broken.
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.860]   It's like up and it's just laughing at me.
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.340]   And so what happens is it's like,
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.060]   it's open and it won't close.
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.080]   It's like the middle console, it's like hanging open.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.980]   And I'm like, I'm looking for something to hold it down.
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.100]   All I got is my Bible.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.940]   Great.
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.760]   And so I like,
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.820]   I've got my Bible holding down my broken car console
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.660]   that I broke in a fit of anger.
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.740]   And so here's the deal.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.080]   We're not talking about anger tonight
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.300]   because I'm convinced that anger
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.220]   is actually just this outworking, the symptom,
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.740]   the outward fruit of what my real problem was.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.500]   And so I wanna tell you what that specific problem was.
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.940]   And then we'll go into tonight.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.180]   That problem I'm convinced was entitlement.
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.160]   Entitlement.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.780]   And I'm gonna give you a definition of entitlement
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.620]   before we go any further
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.260]   so that you know exactly what we're talking about.
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.340]   Entitlement is the belief that your privileges,
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.300]   namely an experience on Tuesday night,
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.380]   an answer about what happened on Tuesday night,
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.460]   anything like that,
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.420]   your privileges, namely things you don't deserve
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.160]   are actually your rights.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.640]   It's believing that the things that are your gifts,
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.100]   your blessings, the kindnesses to you
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.660]   are actually things that you've merited,
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.900]   actually your rights,
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.440]   and you will not part with them easily.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.840]   That's what entitlement is.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.180]   And so I appreciate you getting to chuckle at mine,
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.340]   but let's let you have a go.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.980]   And so from our team to you,
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.660]   let's take a little entitlement quiz tonight
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.500]   and we'll see how we're doing.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.780]   All right, so here we go.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.620]   Entitlement quiz number one.
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.140]   You are almost to the porch on time,
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.740]   but the parking line is slow.
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.100]   No.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.540]   How done are you?
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.400]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.880]   A, done.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.580]   B, so done.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.120]   C, will you forgive me for flipping you off at church?
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.260]   That's the laughter of the guilty right there.
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.120]   Number two, you're working hard for a promotion
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.200]   only for a coworker to get it instead.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.960]   Ouch.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.960]   Your reaction is, I'm overqualified.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.120]   I'm too good for this job.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.980]   B, who did they suck up to?
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.260]   C, I quit, I'm leaving, I'm quit.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.220]   I need a new job, I'm out of here.
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.860]   All right, number three.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:49.940]   Oh boy, close to home.
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.580]   You've been single after college long enough
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.280]   to be counting in years instead of months.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:06.460]   I wish you the best.
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.300]   All right.
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.840]   When asked why, you say, I'm too intimidating.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.140]   These people are scared of me.
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.640]   That sounds like something mama would say, right?
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.760]   They're scared of you.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.640]   B, life sucks.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.060]   C, I need a new church.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.320]   I am out of here.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.160]   I am out of here.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.640]   Six more months of not getting asked out
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.680]   and I am leaving and I'm gonna make sure they know.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.560]   It's gonna be on social media.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.260]   I'm gonna tell 'em.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.860]   We know some of you think that.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.680]   Oh, it's so easy.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.800]   It's so easy in our day and age, in our culture,
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.000]   to sink into this idea of entitlement.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.880]   It's just, there's just breeding grounds for it everywhere.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.980]   The gas pump, it's like you pull up to the gas pump,
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.620]   the buttons don't work, the pump clicks,
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.220]   the receipt doesn't come out.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.800]   It's like, the horror.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.060]   I think I might have to go inside.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.600]   I think I'm gonna have to deal with a person.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.020]   Oh no.
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.160]   It's like, this is the reason.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.520]   Entitlement is the reason.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.480]   This confusion between privileges and rights,
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.840]   this is the reason why the hashtag firstworldprobs exists
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.280]   and it's hilarious.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.220]   This is the reason right here,
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.400]   because the people who have the most
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.360]   seem to have the most problems, which is amazing.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.560]   It's like the pizza, oh, some of you had this.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.140]   The pizza delivery guy comes.
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.280]   There's no ranch.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.480]   You're like, I can't even eat this.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.240]   I can't even deal with this anymore.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.720]   And we hate it, oh, we hate it.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.800]   We hate it when we see it in other people.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.760]   We can't stand it.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.720]   It's like the person's in line at the grocery store
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.640]   in the express line, 15 items or less,
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.320]   and they got that whole cart, and you were like,
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.920]   mm, that right there,
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.500]   that's the problem with humanity right there.
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.640]   And then you get in the express lane in the tollway
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.360]   and you're just going by everybody in traffic like, ha ha.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.200]   Just taking care of entitlement.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.520]   And some of you, I know what you're thinking.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.060]   I paid, it's the tollway.
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.080]   Which tells me you think that you bought your entitlement,
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.520]   you're really not gonna let it go.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.240]   This confusion between privileges and rights
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.280]   is a dangerous thing.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.440]   So here's the good news.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.860]   Jesus knows about this.
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.920]   He knows that we are apt to get our privileges
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.880]   and our rights confused.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.680]   He knows that we are very likely to get confused
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.640]   between what we deserve and what we don't.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.600]   And he knows that we're gonna disappoint ourselves
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.960]   greatly and unnecessarily and cause pain
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.920]   to our relationships and ourselves
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.280]   when we get confused about that.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.920]   And so he told a story once, Matthew chapter 20.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.800]   Matthew chapter 20 is where we'll be tonight.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.120]   He told a story once that discusses this particular idea.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.660]   He speaks very clearly to this particular issue.
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.760]   It's fascinating, it's called a parable.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.160]   So if you don't know what a parable is,
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.520]   it's just a fictional story, one made up story
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.560]   that's designed to illustrate, designed to show one idea.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.760]   So Jesus is going to tell a little made up fictional story
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.600]   about a vineyard, about workers who go into a vineyard
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.800]   and it discusses very clearly entitlement
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.280]   that I'm gonna explain as we go.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.120]   Matthew 20th chapter, that's the first book
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.120]   of your New Testament, first verse of the 20th chapter.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:10.960]   Here we go.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.600]   First one, for the kingdom of heaven
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.300]   is like a master of a house.
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.920]   The master of the house, so that everyone knows,
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.200]   is God and the story represents God in the story,
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.960]   who went out early in the morning
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.680]   to hire laborers for his vineyard.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.820]   Now early in the morning is a specific phrase
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.800]   that means something.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.100]   They were on a specific clock.
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.120]   Like they never had the conversation
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.680]   about, whoa, what are your hours?
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.880]   Are you like normal eight to five?
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.720]   Do you work weekends?
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.560]   Do you work nights?
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.520]   They would have never had that.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.960]   It's like daylights when you work.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.600]   So everybody worked from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.640]   It was a 12 hour shift, roughly 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.600]   And they would count the hours from six
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.600]   and they would go through the day.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.480]   So a 12 hour shift, that was understood.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.040]   And so at 6 a.m. the master of the house
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.040]   goes to hire laborers for his vineyard.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.800]   He's looking in the marketplace for people who can work.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.680]   Says, after agreeing with the laborers, he found some,
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.000]   that were available for hire for a denarius a day,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.160]   he sent them into his vineyard.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.740]   Now you wanna know what a denarius is?
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.600]   That's just a normal day wage for a day laborer.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.920]   So that's like standard wage for day labor.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.160]   So just so that we've got a number,
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.920]   a US dollars number that we can throw in there
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.400]   so that we've got at least a mental picture
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.960]   of how much money this is.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.000]   Call it a little more than a minimum wage,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.040]   $9 an hour, 12 hours, do a little rounding,
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.480]   call it a hundred bucks.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.320]   All right?
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.160]   So the deal is you work for me 12 hours,
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.800]   I'll give you a Benjamin, that's the deal.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.560]   And so they cut this deal to work all day.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.480]   And they go, it says in verse three,
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.720]   and going out about the third hour.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.760]   So remember they start at 6 a.m. and count.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.600]   So the third hour is 9 a.m.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.040]   The master goes back out and he saw others
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.600]   standing idle in the marketplace.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.320]   More people who had zero purpose,
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.360]   they had zero employment, they had nothing to do.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.360]   And he sees them standing idle in the marketplace
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.420]   and he says to them, you guys go into the vineyard too.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.760]   And whatever is right, I will give you.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.640]   Interesting, nonspecific agreement.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.080]   Did you notice that?
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.280]   Did not tell them what they were going to get.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.720]   The first guys, really clear.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.080]   Hey, 6 a.m. people, go work 12 hours,
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.720]   I will give you a Denarius.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.440]   Next group, 9 a.m., hey, you guys go into the vineyard,
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.760]   whatever's right at the end of the day.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.440]   I'll do the math and I'll give it to you.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.280]   Nonspecific.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.160]   So they went.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.440]   Going out again about the sixth hour, that's noon.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.000]   And the ninth hour, that's 3 p.m., he did the same.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.280]   And then the 11th hour, think about this.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.040]   The 11th hour, it's 5 p.m., the workday's almost done,
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.200]   it's almost over.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.680]   About the 11th hour, he goes out
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.640]   and he finds others still standing.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.640]   And he hires them, he says,
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.060]   hey, why do you stand here idle all day long?
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.400]   They said, no one's hired us.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.900]   No one gave us anything to do.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.240]   And he said to them, the master said to them,
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.400]   you go into the vineyard too.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.600]   And so now we got a pack of guys
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.100]   working together in a vineyard.
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.840]   They've been stomping on grapes all day.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.920]   It's hot out there.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.340]   And they have joined,
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.800]   they have been joined into this group in stages.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.120]   And so imagine you're the 6 a.m. crew.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.160]   Imagine you're the guys who have endured the heat of the day,
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.920]   you're the guys who have worked the hardest
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.200]   and earned your keep,
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.520]   and you guys had the guarantee of what was coming to you.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.360]   And all of a sudden, you're out there working at six,
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.600]   and then some more guys come,
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.680]   and then some more guys come,
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.800]   and then some more guys come.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.520]   At some point, this is going to cross your mind.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.600]   You're gonna think, who are these guys?
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.000]   Did the master hire them?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.540]   And whose pay exactly are they gonna cut into?
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.280]   Because you wanna make sure
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.160]   that your part of the deal is preserved.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.760]   You wanna make sure that the agreement that you had
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.920]   is absolutely honored, but you make room for them.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.720]   And on and on and on the day goes
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.960]   until finally 60 minutes before time to quit,
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.300]   even more people come.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:45.880]   So with question marks everywhere, finally at six o'clock,
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.100]   time to quit and go see the boss.
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.000]   So here they come.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.880]   And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.080]   said to his foreman, call the laborers
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.480]   and pay them their wages.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.680]   Here's where it gets interesting.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.780]   Beginning with the last, the people who worked the least,
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.440]   the 5 p.m. crew that worked for an hour,
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.520]   up to the first who worked all day, those first hired.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.800]   And when those hired about the 11th hour came,
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.560]   each of them received a denarius.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.320]   Okay, picture this moment.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.720]   We got all these guys lined up in reverse order
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.960]   that they were hired in.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.600]   The first guys come up, it's time to get paid.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.880]   Everybody likes to get paid, it's payday.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.720]   And so he's standing right here
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.040]   and he gets paid a denarius, okay?
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.260]   And nobody knows where they're getting paid
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.440]   except the guys in the very back.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.940]   They're the only ones who know what they're getting paid.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.360]   So it's presumable that the first group to be paid
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.600]   is gonna get a 12th of that
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.280]   'cause they worked a 12th as long.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.760]   Instead, they receive a denarius.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.760]   Well, here's what happens.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.400]   The guy who's second in line is bound to be looking over.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.640]   I mean, there's no way that he wouldn't be.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.960]   And so the next group is kinda looking
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.000]   and they see that this starts to happen and people talk.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.800]   I've heard a saying, three people can keep a secret
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.320]   as long as two of them are dead.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.600]   I believe that that's true.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.680]   And so here's the deal.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.400]   Like people are going to talk,
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.640]   people are going to share, people are gonna talk.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.720]   And so all of a sudden they found out,
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.120]   hey, these guys got a denarius for their hour.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.240]   And that news trickles back into the line.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.680]   And that creates a dangerous little thing
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.680]   called entitlement, hope, expectation.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.360]   All those things.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.800]   And so that starts to rise the farther the line goes.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:30.000]   Verse 10, now when those hired first came,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.120]   when they were hired, those who had hired earlier,
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.480]   worked the longest, worked the hardest,
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.880]   they thought they would receive more.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.360]   There's your entitlement.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.440]   They thought they would receive more.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.840]   Not they hoped, not, oh, that would be a privilege
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.760]   that I would like.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.120]   They thought, they thought they would receive more.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.960]   They were convinced that they would actually receive more.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.840]   Can't you hear them?
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.200]   12, one denarius for an hour.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.680]   Does that mean we're gonna get 12?
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.560]   Does that mean we're gonna get to pay $1,200 for this day?
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.760]   But each of them also received a denarius.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.400]   And on receiving it, they grumbled
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.760]   at the master of the house,
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.880]   who just kept his end of the deal, to be clear,
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.720]   saying these last worked only for an hour.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.200]   They worked for one hour.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.760]   Can you feel the outrage in that?
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.880]   They worked for one hour.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.760]   They gave, you gave them what you agreed to for us.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:27.280]   And you have made them equal to us,
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.680]   who have borne the burden of the day
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.320]   and the scorching heat.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.440]   In other words, there's a little problem here
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.800]   between what was given and what's being received.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.760]   You are not giving me, master, what I deserve.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.160]   You are not giving me the things that I bargained for.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.400]   And so they forgot a really key piece of information.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.520]   It's in verse 10.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.720]   They thought they would receive more.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.200]   They forgot what they deserved.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.720]   They completely forgot what they actually deserved.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.640]   That is a dangerous thing to do, by the way.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.920]   And so our first point tonight is remember what you deserve.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.280]   Remember what you deserve.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.600]   Now you gotta be careful there,
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.600]   because that sounds a little bit like entitlement, right?
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.360]   I'm gonna assert what I deserve.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.560]   What I mean by that is,
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.160]   what I mean by remember what you deserve is,
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.040]   I mean, remember what you actually deserve.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.520]   What you biblically deserve.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.880]   What you really should get.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.040]   What you're entitled to.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.400]   What your rights really are.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.240]   So let's take a look at this.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.400]   Romans 3, 23, very famous verse.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.560]   Many of you have seen it before.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.840]   All have sinned.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.760]   By all, I'm gonna pause on the story just for a second,
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.520]   and I'm gonna see what we actually deserve,
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.480]   and then we're gonna go back.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.440]   So it says in Romans 3, 23, all have sinned.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.160]   By all, of course, it means every human being
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.240]   who's ever lived, and by sin,
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.640]   it means lived in a way that's contrary to God.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.880]   Lived in a way that's offensive to God.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.800]   Lived in a way that puts a spiritual,
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.680]   obscene gesture in God's general direction.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.680]   Every human being who has ever lived has lived that way.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.280]   Every single person is a sinner.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.280]   That's where we are.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.160]   The news does not get better.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.040]   Romans 6, 23.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.400]   The wages, interesting word there.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.280]   That's like an entitled to word.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.600]   That's like a deserve word.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.640]   It's like a what we should get word.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.360]   The wages of sin is death.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.640]   The wages of sin is death.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.600]   So in nine or 10 words right there,
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.160]   the scripture has made it really, really clear.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.640]   Those are taken out of their verses,
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.880]   that's why there's dot, dot, dot,
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.160]   but they're not taken out of context.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.360]   This is what they mean.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.160]   They mean that every human being who's ever lived
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.240]   and ever had a life actually has sinned against God,
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.640]   and that there's a wage for that,
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.440]   there is an entitlement that comes with that,
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.960]   there is a payment that comes with that,
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.040]   there is a what you deserve that comes with that,
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.880]   and it's death, and by death,
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.000]   it means separation from God,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.280]   separation from the life giver,
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.800]   separation from everything that reminds you of life.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.160]   The Bible has a word for it, hell.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.600]   That's what we deserve.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.840]   If you have a pulse and you can hear my voice right now,
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.360]   that's what you deserve.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.480]   That's the biblical truth.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.800]   Which is why you wanna be very careful
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.160]   about asserting what you deserve in this life.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.520]   That's why you wanna be very hesitant
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.960]   to speak really broadly and really boldly
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.640]   about what you think you should get.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.160]   You might wanna remember what these workers forgot
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.360]   in the parable, they forgot what they actually deserve,
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.880]   it led to lots of heartache for them.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.640]   You would do well to remember,
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.760]   well to remember those little verses
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.920]   of what you actually deserve from God.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.000]   You wanna thank God tonight that he is not fair.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.840]   God is so much better than fair.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.680]   If you want God to be fair,
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.400]   I mean, check out Hinduism, I wouldn't encourage it,
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.480]   you can check out karma,
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.280]   you can check out any other ideological system out there,
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.600]   you're probably gonna find some false idea of balance.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.520]   God is so much better than fair.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.920]   He is better than fair.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.400]   If you are alive right now,
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.160]   you are getting better than you deserve
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.760]   from God today, right now.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.480]   Think about this with me.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.960]   Five million people or so woke up today
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.720]   in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.720]   Not one person deserved it, nobody.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.120]   We woke up today and you know what we got?
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.840]   All of us, sinners, saints, thieves, criminals,
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.480]   rapists, murderers, people doing everything they can
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.840]   to glorify God and people who are doing everything they can
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.280]   to run as fast as they can from God.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.920]   Everybody got the same exact thing, precipitation.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.000]   And half of us were mad about it
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.800]   'cause we're so entitled to our food.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.480]   It says in Matthew 5:45,
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.040]   "God sends rain on the just and the unjust.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.480]   "He makes his sun rise on the evil and the good."
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.920]   God gives grace that's common to everyone,
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.280]   namely the fact that you can breathe right now.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.240]   So if we're gonna talk about what we actually deserve,
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.280]   we gotta lower the bar way down
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.880]   because we don't deserve anything good from God.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.480]   We deserve less than nothing from God.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.000]   These guys made the mistake.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.400]   They forgot what they deserve.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.840]   If you are struggling to remember what your due is,
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.920]   it's simply, this is gonna be redundant,
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.520]   it is simply because you forgot what you deserve.
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.840]   You completely forgot what it is that you deserve from God.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.720]   Entitlement cannot get a foothold
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.360]   if you don't allow that to happen.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.600]   It always starts here.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.760]   Forget what you signed on for,
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.360]   you just forget what you deserve.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.400]   They forgot that in this story,
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.160]   and now they've gotta deal with the master.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.920]   Verse 13, Matthew 20.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.160]   "But he replied to one of them, 'Friend.'"
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.400]   Isn't that gentle for someone who forgets what they deserve
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.080]   and then come falsely given a charge
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.280]   and falsely given an accusation?
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.960]   You did us wrong when you did no,
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.280]   when he did no wrong,
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.960]   when the master actually did no wrong.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.000]   But look how gently he replies,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.880]   "Friend, I'm doing you no wrong.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.680]   "Did you not agree with me for a denarius?
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.040]   "Did you not agree with me for a denarius?"
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.320]   Side note, I think I would have added,
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.480]   and you didn't even have a job.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.840]   Let's just talk about how you did not have a job.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.480]   You were like gainfully unemployed
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.240]   before we got into this arrangement.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.000]   "Did you not agree with me for a denarius?
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.840]   "Take what belongs to you and go."
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.960]   And look at these words.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.160]   You can't blame him for being unclear.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.000]   This is clear.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.960]   "I choose.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.880]   "I choose.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.600]   "I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you."
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.440]   Listen, friend.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:34.200]   Am I not allowed to do what I choose
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.760]   with what belongs to me?
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.680]   Would you wanna hear that from God?
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.520]   Come here, friend.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.360]   Let's have a little talk.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.080]   [congregation laughing]
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.160]   Do I not get to pick?
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.200]   Don't I pick?
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.760]   Don't I choose?
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.960]   My second point tonight is God distributes everything.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.880]   God distributes everything.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.800]   Everything that's valuable in the universe,
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.440]   God distributes.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.440]   He owns it, it's his, and he distributes it as he sees.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.920]   So everything, that means talent,
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.360]   that means success, that means relationships,
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:22.360]   it means money, it means kids and families and cars,
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.080]   it means houses, it means addresses
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.360]   where those houses are placed,
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.800]   it means titles, promotions, approval, and a lot more.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.320]   God owns it all.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.360]   He owns everything, and he distributes it as he sees fit.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.240]   Psalm 24, one says, "The earth is the Lord
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.600]   "and all that fills it."
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.520]   The earth, the whole thing, is the Lord's
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.160]   and everything that fills it.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.680]   "The world and those who dwell therein."
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.440]   Even the people, God owns the people.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.400]   He owns everything, and he distributes everything.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.000]   I love this, because this will always be
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.580]   the response of Jesus to entitlement.
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:08.040]   This will always be the response of Jesus to entitlement.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.000]   You're not gonna catch him being rough with you.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.940]   Hey, friend, he's gentle.
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.360]   But he's also not gonna lie to you and say,
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.240]   you know what, yes, yes, I have done you wrong.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.200]   I guess it's never gonna happen.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.320]   Here's the shortest conversation between you and Jesus ever.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.800]   It's the one where he lists the things
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.920]   that he did you wrong.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.000]   [congregation laughing]
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.960]   That is a short talk, shortest sermon in porch history.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.120]   All the ways God did you wrong.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.600]   Let's close in prayer, it's done.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.420]   [congregation laughing]
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.420]   You have never been done wrong by God, ever.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:40.660]   But we still come with suspicion, don't we?
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:41.600]   Don't we come?
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.360]   Don't we come with accusation?
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.360]   Let me try some on, I'm just gonna make these up.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.300]   I've been following you for a decade of singleness, God.
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.140]   A decade.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.960]   That person has been following you for about eight months.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.320]   And it looks like they've got a God-fearing relationship
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.720]   that's gonna go towards marriage.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.760]   And see, I didn't understand, I didn't understand
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.220]   that you were gonna be so confusing
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.120]   in the way you distribute these things.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:11.800]   Someone else gets a car, someone else gets a job,
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.840]   someone else gets a promotion,
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.120]   someone else comes to the job later
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.840]   and then runs away with all the opportunity
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.640]   and oh, we come with the accusation.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.960]   You didn't give me what I deserve.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.960]   I endured it, I endured more.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.800]   I'm the harder worker, I'm the one who's done more for you.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.720]   Jesus says, okay, hard worker, let me remind you of something
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.020]   friend, I've done you no wrong.
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.840]   He is kind, if you wanna know how he's gonna handle
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.560]   your entitlement issue, he is kind,
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.760]   he is clear and he is honest.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:49.760]   Here's kind, friend, here's clear, I did you no wrong.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:55.760]   Here's honest, I choose, I choose, I do.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.020]   And I know you don't like that if you don't trust me,
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:02.120]   but if you do trust me, you love it, you'll love it
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.520]   'cause I'm watching you too.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.920]   And then if that weren't enough,
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.520]   Jesus asked the last penetrating question
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.760]   and it is the most difficult to read
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.500]   if you get caught in an entitled moment.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.280]   Listen to this question from Jesus.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.440]   Or do you begrudge my generosity?
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.160]   Do you begrudge my generosity?
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.240]   In other words, hey, are you mad at me
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.540]   'cause I was nice to them?
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:29.400]   Can you imagine that conversation between you and Jesus?
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.440]   He has done you no wrong.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.000]   He has never done you any wrong.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.600]   He's never done your family any wrong.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.800]   He's never done, because after all, we know what we deserve.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.160]   And so he has never actually given you what you deserve.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.340]   He has consistently for every day of your entire life
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.560]   given you better than what you actually
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.880]   and biblically deserve.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.680]   And you come in with the accusation
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.600]   because of what he's given somebody else
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.440]   and he looks at you and says,
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.360]   hey, you gonna be mad at me
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.740]   'cause I was kind to that person, friend?
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.000]   He didn't have to yell.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.080]   That's so heart penetrating.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.920]   I mean, what does he have to do?
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.640]   He could whisper that and you would melt.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.880]   Hey, you gonna be mad at me
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.500]   because I was nice to that person?
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.320]   You gonna be mad because that imperfect self
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.260]   got more than your imperfect self?
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.480]   Can we just remember for a second
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.820]   what everybody here deserves?
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.520]   I did you no wrong.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.080]   Do you begrudge my generosity?
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.320]   And then this last statement tells me
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.160]   that he is trying to warn us.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.280]   He's trying to warn us.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.280]   Don't miss this last bit.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.000]   He is trying to show us
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.240]   that it is not going to make sense
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.360]   if you try to observe what everybody else
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.760]   is being distributed to and what they're receiving.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.960]   It is not going to add up in your sight
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.720]   if you choose to try to look left and right
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.120]   and decide in what order you should go
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.640]   and in what order the promotion should come
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.440]   and in what order the spouse should come
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.160]   and in what order the money should come
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.920]   or in what order, comparatively speaking, at all.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.920]   It's like he's trying to warn us away from this
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.840]   and so he says, so the last will be first
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.600]   and the first last.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.060]   In other words, in your eyes, in your eyes,
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.060]   whenever we line up to get payday,
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.120]   first, why don't you remember
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.600]   that you don't really want payday
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.960]   because payday's bad for you.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.120]   You don't want what you deserve.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.360]   But when you line up to receive grace from me,
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.680]   when you line up to receive the things
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.000]   that you don't deserve from me,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.880]   when you line up to receive privilege from me,
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.360]   let me warn you about something.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.400]   If you watch what other people receive,
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.080]   it might not seem to go in order to you.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.680]   I just wanna warn you ahead of time.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.800]   The first will be last and the last first.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.160]   And I know I could've cleared all this up
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.040]   if I just paid everybody like a normal person.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.560]   But that's not the way I do things.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.720]   It's going to be different.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.720]   The math won't work, your powers of observation
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.440]   will not work, your ability to piece together
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.560]   what God's doing won't work
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:39.960]   because it's just simply on a canvas
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.040]   that's bigger than you can see.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.160]   And so let me just warn you,
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.120]   don't begrudge my generosity to other people.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.280]   And I just wanna let you know ahead of time,
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.280]   the last will be first and the first will be last.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.560]   Comparison will kill you.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.000]   So my last point tonight is that comparison
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.120]   fuels entitlement.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.320]   Comparison fuels entitlement.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.960]   These guys were fine.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.320]   These guys were fine until they saw
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.120]   what the other people got.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.080]   Like what if they had been blindfolded and earplugged
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.120]   and then they got to the front
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.160]   and then it was let there be light
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.000]   and they got paid their denarius.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.880]   I bet they went home fine.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.240]   They would have gone home just fine,
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.880]   wouldn't have been a problem.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.600]   But see, there's something about that awareness.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.840]   There's something about that vision
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.120]   into what other people are getting from God.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.440]   And we know it's from God.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.080]   We know deep down that the one who is behind the choices
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.880]   and the one who is behind the blessings
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.080]   that other people receive, we know it's God.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.280]   And if we start to compare,
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.400]   we are gonna be really, really in danger.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.440]   Just simply by virtue of the knowledge
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.840]   we'll be really in danger of assuming
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.240]   that we deserve a fraction or in proportion
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.560]   to what that other person received.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:51.040]   And it can lead to confusion and certainly entitlement,
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.800]   the confusion of what is deserved versus what is not.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.960]   So let me give you two ideas as we finish up tonight.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.800]   Two ideas.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:01.640]   So you're like, so what do I do?
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.600]   Like what can I do about entitlement?
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.560]   I got two ideas for you.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.000]   You can choose which one you are.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.280]   And so if you happen to be a Jesus follower,
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.360]   if you identify tonight, you're like, I'm a Christian.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.200]   Yes, that's me.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.040]   I follow him.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:12.960]   I believe in him.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.440]   I believe that he actually is the son of God
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.760]   that he proclaims to be,
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.120]   that he literally died and literally rose again,
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.960]   that that's a real thing that happened in a real place
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.040]   at a real time and that he is alive today
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.000]   and that he is God and I'm giving him my whole life.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.780]   If that's you, I have a simple exercise for you.
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.160]   I did it earlier today, in fact.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.000]   I would love for you to try to do this.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.240]   Take a pen and put it on the paper
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.920]   and write down 100 things.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.360]   This feels like school, 100 things.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.800]   So write down, pen on paper, 100 things
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.580]   that are your privileges but that you tend to forget
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.080]   and think they're your rights.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:53.860]   So find 100 things, 100 things that you think,
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.960]   like on your worst day, when you wake up
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.280]   and you get angry and you're like,
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.280]   there's never a car console around here when I need one
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.200]   because I am upset right now.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.560]   [congregation laughing]
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.760]   It like falls in waves.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.160]   I thought you guys weren't with me for a second.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.400]   I didn't know everybody laughed.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.280]   [congregation laughing]
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.360]   On your worst days, those things that you think
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.640]   are your rights, those things.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.620]   Write them down and just simply remind yourself,
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.740]   this is it, these are privileges.
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:24.000]   These things, these are privileges.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   I'm not owed anything on this list, not at all.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.620]   Every one of these things is a gift.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:36.880]   Just reclassify them and remind yourself.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.000]   I did this earlier today and so here it is.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:39.840]   It took me half an hour.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.020]   This is not a long assignment.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:43.040]   So I did this in half an hour.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.660]   And so I wrote down, I know you're like,
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.760]   how do you even read that?
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.960]   And so I wrote down, there's everything on here
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.060]   from my relationship with God, my access to God.
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.720]   That was number one, my access to God.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.040]   And so I just started to write.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:59.440]   And everything is on that list from my fiance's smile
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.140]   to my ability to practice hygiene.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:04.440]   Like everything is on that list.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.080]   Everything that I could possibly think of.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.000]   And I would get stuck.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   I'm like, socks, shoes, shoelaces, shoe cleaner.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.140]   You know, it's like, you just get stuck.
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.200]   I mean, you start to have fun with it.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.320]   It's like, oh my goodness.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.560]   And so I looked at that piece of paper
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.040]   and I thought that could have gone for a very long time.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:26.280]   And all of a sudden, I just have a little more joy today.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.520]   You know why?
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.260]   Because instead of assuming that the things
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.640]   that are right here, instead of assuming
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.480]   that the things right here are
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.520]   because of my intrinsic meanness,
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.480]   all of a sudden I remember this is just
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.760]   'cause I'm loved by God.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.960]   Everything I have, every relationship in my life,
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.800]   every person, a lot of these are names, ton of 'em.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.180]   Family, yes, family.
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.840]   Right?
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.520]   Everything on there is not owed me.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:53.360]   So why don't you do that?
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.480]   If you count yourself a Christ follower,
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.840]   why don't you try that on?
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.900]   If you are not, if you would say, hey, I don't know, man.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.040]   I don't know.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.160]   I'm not really a God person.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.200]   I'm not really a Jesus person.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.520]   I'm not really the religious type
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.040]   or however you might self-describe.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.400]   Let me give you something.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.800]   This passage was actually written for you.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.800]   Matthew chapter 20, verses one through 16, I think it is,
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.220]   is written for you.
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:21.000]   The primary thing that Jesus is trying
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.800]   to communicate with this story is in fact not a tip,
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.100]   a trick, or a technique about how to fight entitlement,
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.040]   although it is clearly useful for that.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.800]   His goal is to communicate that no matter
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.560]   where you are in your life, no matter where you are
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.240]   in your relationship to God right now,
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.800]   you can have a connection with him that starts today.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.120]   You, it is not too late.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.640]   You have not wasted so much time
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.320]   that God will not come to the marketplace
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.560]   or whatever place you're in and call you
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.160]   to be a part of what he's doing.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:50.920]   There is no such thing as a situation
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.500]   that you've created for yourself
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.400]   that God will not approach you and say, hey, come with me.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.440]   I got a place for you.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.280]   I wanna call you friend.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.560]   Let me explain how this works.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.080]   The passage is for you.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.880]   And don't misunderstand.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.800]   It's not there so you can say, oh, goody,
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.320]   I'll wait till the last hour.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.620]   It might be the last hour.
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:13.560]   This might be the last time Jesus calls clearly to you.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.400]   It might be your 5 p.m.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.360]   And so if you don't happen to follow Christ,
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.760]   why don't you spend some time with us afterward
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.000]   and let us just talk with you.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.560]   We won't force you to do anything,
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.280]   but we'll share with you what the truth is
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.640]   and the kind call of God that he wants
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.880]   to give you purpose and call you friend.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.060]   That's what the passage is designed to do.
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:36.500]   (pages rustling)
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.460]   Love to close with a story.
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.820]   A couple weeks ago, my girlfriend, then girlfriend,
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:45.700]   and I decided to go to Palo Duro Canyon.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.060]   Shout out, West Texas.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.660]   (congregation cheering)
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:50.660]   Shameless.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:51.500]   All right.
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:54.820]   West Texas, all right.
[00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.740]   And I thought, I've been to Palo Duro Canyon before.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:57.700]   She's not from Texas.
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.380]   She just got here as fast as she could.
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.180]   And so she's never seen it.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.100]   I'm like, okay, Palo Duro,
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.300]   it's kind of this big hole in the ground
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.300]   and I've seen it before, but you know what,
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.500]   happy boo, happy you.
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.700]   So I'm like, all right, here we go.
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:16.220]   She's listening in Fort Worth right now
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.820]   and she's very nervous, I promise.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.180]   Okay, so we go out to Palo Duro Canyon.
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.140]   It's beautiful.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.020]   It's more beautiful than I remembered.
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.360]   I'd love to show you a picture of it, in fact.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.300]   So there we are.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.620]   It's so great and all.
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:30.300]   And so just like two feet farther away from the camera
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:31.140]   and we're done.
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.940]   So we just got our feet hanging off right there.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.100]   But it is a beautiful spot.
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:34.920]   We're loving it.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.020]   We just handed my phone to a guy that was passing by
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.840]   and I thought, this is beautiful.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.180]   So I think we're gonna just propose right here.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.380]   So this is what's about to happen.
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.580]   So that actually happened.
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.540]   And so a few minutes later,
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:44.780]   we handed my phone to another guy.
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.180]   He was like walking by.
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.380]   I was like, hey man, will you take our picture?
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.820]   And I did it kind of rudely, kind of abruptly.
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:49.900]   I was like, hey man, will you take a picture?
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:50.980]   And he was like, yeah, I guess.
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:51.820]   And he saw me go like this.
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.700]   He was like, oh, and he started fumbling with the phone.
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.260]   But he got it pointed in the right direction.
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.320]   Thank you, thank you.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.100]   So there we are.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.940]   And we are happy.
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.640]   Okay, those are happy people.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.980]   All right, we're excited to marry each other.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:13.100]   Like, I think it's gonna go great.
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:13.940]   I really do.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:14.760]   She's my better half.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.660]   I'm her other half.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.100]   Like, this is gonna go really great.
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.140]   So that's where we are.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.700]   Now, look, let's just be honest with you for a second.
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.460]   I know that that's a lot of fun.
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.340]   But you think entitlement, is it like,
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:26.180]   look at those two people.
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.320]   You think entitlement's in there anywhere,
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.720]   in those two people's minds?
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:34.300]   Oh yeah, it was there.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:35.900]   You think I expected a yes?
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:39.180]   You're not gonna insult me, come on.
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.380]   (audience laughing)
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.980]   You think I expected a yes?
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.020]   I'm not exactly the kind of guy
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.820]   who goes to the jeweler on a whim, all right?
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.300]   We had talked about this.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.480]   I was expecting a yes, all right?
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.320]   What about her?
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.980]   You think she was expecting a ring?
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:53.880]   You think she felt entitled to a ring?
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.660]   I don't think I pulled out a diamond
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:58.700]   and she thought, this guy is a pioneer.
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:37:59.540]   What a--
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:06.360]   What a creative.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.700]   This guy digs deep, wow.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:16.540]   I really doubt, I really doubt that happened, okay?
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.340]   And there's plenty, I mean, the smiles are genuine.
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:21.020]   I mean, there's plenty of happiness there.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:22.180]   But imagine with me for a second,
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.560]   imagine this with me for a second.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.160]   What if there was like no entitlement?
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.620]   What if there had been zero?
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.380]   Truly, and I know that's hard to get there, right?
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.300]   Because you just expect,
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.440]   like we have these cultural expectations.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.540]   But imagine just for a second,
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.220]   like what if moments like this,
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.980]   not just moments like this, but any moment,
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:42.700]   what if that could have been experienced
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.940]   with zero entitlement whatsoever?
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:47.860]   I'm talking about like there has never been
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.540]   a person proposed outside in nature before ever.
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:51.880]   Like there's just no knowledge of that.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.440]   There's never been a ring involved in this deal ever.
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.580]   There's like all kinds of credit coming in all over the place
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:00.500]   and so like nobody has any entitlement whatsoever.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.420]   You think the joy rises?
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:05.700]   Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:10.060]   So here's why I'm telling you that.
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:15.060]   Your joy will be capped by your own expectations.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:21.400]   Your joy will be limited by your own sense of entitlement.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.840]   You know why?
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.640]   Because when you get the things you want,
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.240]   you'll just say, "I had it coming to me."
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.820]   And when you don't, you'll just be mad.
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.640]   That's what entitlement does.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.160]   When entitlement rises,
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.480]   it takes away your ability to enjoy anything
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.880]   because the things that you get,
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.040]   "I just had it coming to me.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:38.960]   "That's what I deserved anyway.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.760]   "It's really more of a paycheck than anything."
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.100]   And the things you don't get, you are frustrated about.
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:43.940]   You can't stand it.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.400]   You end up punching your car.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:53.040]   So what happens is as your entitlement minimum rises,
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.400]   your joy maximum falls.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.080]   Does that make sense?
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.600]   And it is possible to be so entitled, in fact,
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.100]   that you run at a deficit.
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.000]   You're frustrated.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.160]   You don't love your life.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.320]   In fact, you hate it
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.360]   because you think God gave you a raw deal when he didn't
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:11.340]   because of the confusion called entitlement.
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:14.040]   I'll say that one more time.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.440]   If you don't have a minimum entitlement,
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.480]   you will have no maximum joy.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.360]   What if you woke up tomorrow rejoicing about your roof,
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:28.360]   your AC, your hot water, your car, your job, your boss?
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.240]   Yeah, I went there, your boss, even your boss, okay?
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.640]   Like what if you rejoiced about every single thing
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.740]   in your life, everything?
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:40.600]   You would feel like you were moving around in God's theater
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.920]   watching the movie play and you would enjoy it.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.760]   That's what would happen.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.080]   You're fighting for your joy tonight.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.600]   I don't want you to embrace some false reality.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.520]   A lack of entitlement is not embracing some false reality.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.960]   I'll fake myself out like I don't deserve anything
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:54.920]   and then I'll be happy.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.440]   No, no, no.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.640]   It's not that.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:01.360]   It's remembering that you actually don't deserve anything.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.280]   It's not some false humility idea where it's like,
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.780]   okay, just lower my expectations.
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.200]   Like I don't think something good
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.480]   is gonna like should come my way.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:11.120]   It's no, nothing good should come your way.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.160]   That's the reality.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.200]   And if you can embrace that,
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.040]   you will be a joyful, free, faith-filled person.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:22.000]   Let me pray that that's who we'd be.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.060]   Thank you, Jesus, Son of God,
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.480]   that you did not grasp the things
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.660]   that you could have grasped for,
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.200]   that you did not leverage the things
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.160]   that you could have leveraged.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.640]   You were never confused about what you deserve.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.000]   In fact, you deserved everything and you gave it all up
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.040]   for the sake of connecting us to God.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.120]   Thank you, thank you.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.560]   God, will you make it possible,
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.200]   will you make it possible, God,
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.920]   that we would connect to you through faith
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.680]   in a way that receives that as one who is rejoicing,
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.160]   as one who is receiving what's not deserved,
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.540]   every gift, whether it's proposal
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:01.160]   or just waking up from a nap, it does not matter.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.300]   Everything is from you, everything.
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:08.180]   Give us open hands, God.
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.520]   You can place in and you can take out.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.280]   You can place in and then you can move it
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.560]   to somebody else's hand.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.120]   You are in charge, you distribute everything.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.500]   We deserve nothing.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:21.840]   Let us keep our eyes on you, the one who loves us,
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:25.760]   the one who cares for us, the one who calls us friend,
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.960]   even when we accuse.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:36.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
