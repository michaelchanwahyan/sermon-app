[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Here lies the old me.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   The kid my parents wanted me to be.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   All the ways the world hurt me.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Goodbye to my fears and anxieties.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   The reason why my ex left me.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Rest in peace to the old me.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   [Music]
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   All right, welcome everybody in the room, everyone up front.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   All the Forge Live locations, Indianapolis, North Houston,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Tulsa, Scottsdale, Cedar Rapids, Boise, wherever you are at, welcome.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   We are wrapping up this series, RIP, rest in peace to the old me.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Where we have been looking at what it looks like for Christians,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   those of us who have put our faith in Jesus, to live out the new life.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5, verse 17,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   "If anyone is in Christ, they are a new creation."
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   The moment you trusted in Jesus, you were not made better, you were made new.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   You were born again.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   And now the Christian life is living out who God calls us
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and who God says that we are.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   So we have been marching through that.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Tonight we are going to wrap up the series and talk about an issue that I think,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   candidly, if anything, the weight I carry is how to convince a room like this
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   of the enormous importance of what we are about to talk about.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Before I dive in there, let me invite you into my world.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I have got a 3-year-old daughter named Monroe.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Here is a picture of her.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   She is a princess for days.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   When you have girls like my son, and I have got another newborn son,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   but with her the contrast is so stark in that he wants to wrestle,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   wants to play sports, wants to punch things,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   and she wants to dress up like a princess and have tea parties.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   So we have tea parties.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   We sit down and we walk through and she will make--
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   if you have a 3-year-old--this is going somewhere--
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   the tea party does not look quite like this one,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   but it does involve a little miniature set.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   She will sit there and she is like, "Daddy, would you like some tea?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I will make you some tea."
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   She puts in the fake sugar.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   She is like, "Would you like some cream?"
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Because she does not say cream.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   She says cream.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Then her older brother comes in and is like, "It is cream, Monroe."
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I am like, "I will spank you so hard."
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   She can say cream until she is 23 if she wants to.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   It is the greatest thing ever that she cannot do her R's.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   We will sit there and she wants to just do tea parties.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Now what does it have to do with what we are talking about tonight?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Well, we are talking about RIP to the subject of gossip.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   There is an expression that we use as it relates to gossip
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   that is directly related to tea parties.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   It is spill the tea.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   The reason it is kind of a genius analogy that people understand
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   is that just like with tea, you have this thing where you sit down
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   and historically tea time, tracing all the way back to Europe and England and London
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   where people would sit down and over a cup of tea,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   people would get together and discuss the royals and discuss the latest gossip
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   and discuss the latest drama and they would sit there.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Even today we embrace some of the language of like,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   "Oh, that is some boiling hot tea.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Woo, this is so hot."
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Or, "Man, the tea, it is brewed, it is fresh and let me spill it to you."
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   What do they mean by that?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   They mean, "Have you heard about what she did?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Did you know?"
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Man, you can't--don't tell anybody else I told you this.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   But I found out and we spill the tea and we gossip
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   and we take that and we pass on gossip.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Now, what could be the problem with that?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Well, just like in that situation,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   if I was to pass on a cup of tea to somebody out here,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   it inherently depends on what you're consuming.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And if it's poisonous, which the Bible says that gossip is,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   it's going to have some significant consequences for those who take it in.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And the Bible also says that it doesn't just have consequences for those who take it in,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   it has consequences for those who pour it out.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   And I want to talk about why God says this is such a big deal for the next few minutes.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   But before we go there, let me define gossip.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And in order to do so, I want to go to the fountain of all human wisdom, Urban Dictionary.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Urban Dictionary says this, "What is gossip?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It is something nasty people do when they are bored, have no life, or are really stupid.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   It's nasty because a lot of the time you never hear about it
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   and people are way too PC to admit and are nice to you to your face,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   but spread nasty gossip behind your back.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And you never know what happened when someone suddenly hates you and for no reason,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   or some people start threatening you for no reason,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   or become some losers with no life or brain decided gossip
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   because they're too stupid to have any hobbies or real social life
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   or any shred of conscience whatsoever."
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Gossip is what happens when you get a knife in your back.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Man, I don't know who you are, Clueless Furball,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   but someone clearly hurt you back in November.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Now gossip, even that definition, and how great is Urban Dictionary
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   that just anybody can write it up, everybody gets to play,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   but that is a reflection of clearly someone who's been hurt by gossip.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Now let me give a more narrow and accurate, concise definition.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Gossip is talking negatively or spreading negative information about someone not there.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Gossip is spreading negative information or talking negatively about someone
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   behind their back or not there.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   In other words, a lot of times people think gossip is not gossip if it's true.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Yes, it is.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Gossip is talking negatively about someone behind their back
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   who is not a part of the problem or the solution.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And I'm going to unpack exactly what I mean by that.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And this is an issue that as I started, I feel a burden that, honestly,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   there are some of you that no matter how hard I plea with how deadly and destructive
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   and if you participate and allow gossip to be a part of your regular life,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   it's going to be for the rest of your life.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   God says in Proverbs 6, he lists out six things that he hates,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   and one of them is directly related to gossip.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   In other words, God says, "Let me give you the six things that I hate."
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   One of them is somebody who murders. One of them is somebody who lies.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   And then he says this in Proverbs 6, 16 and 19,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   "There are six things the Lord hates, seven that are detestable to him."
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Verse 19, someone who pours out lies and a person who stirs up conflict in the community.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   In Romans 1, the apostle Paul writes out and he lists behavioral characteristics
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   of people living in direct rebellion to God.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And he includes some very fascinating things and the things we would assume,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   like murderer, and he includes gossip.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   He says this, Romans 1, 29 and 30,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   "Those living in rebellion to God are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant, boastful.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   They invent ways of doing evil," and he continues the list.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Why would God say it's such a big deal?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   It's just spilling the tea, it's just catching up,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   it's just me venting a little bit of what's going on.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Why would that be such a bad idea?
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Because as we're going to see, like few other things,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   gossip has the ability to destroy relationships,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   to destroy some of the closest of friendships,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   to destroy and create toxic work environments, toxic families.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   And so God writes over and over and over about when it comes to believers in Jesus,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   gossiping and talking negatively about someone who is not present
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   is not to be a part of our lives.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   So I want to walk through quickly in the next 30 minutes the reasons why we gossip,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   the results of that gossip,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   and then what Scripture says is the remedy or the way that we remove gossip inside of our life.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And some of you guys, you're tuning me out right now,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   and this makes up 70% of what you talk about.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Like if you were to remove all gossip from your conversations in life today,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   you would have said like seven words.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   You'd have been like, "It's cold," or "It's hot."
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   It's how you bond at work.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   It's how you catch up in community.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And it is an offense to God.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And it's something that, candidly, as a bigger brother,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   I am pleading with you to listen to the instructions that God gives us
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   so that you can experience the type of relationships, unity, peace,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   that in your heart of hearts you want and so few people experience.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   So we're going to look at the reasons, the results, and the removal.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   So number one, the reasons why we gossip.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Let me read this proverb from Proverbs 18, verse 8.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Proverbs written 3,000 years ago by the wisest man who ever lived.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   And he's talking about gossip.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   "The words of a gossip are like choice morsels or delicious desserts.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   They go down into the inmost parts."
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   So Solomon says, "Hey, gossip, it tastes good."
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   The reason why we gossip is it feels good.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   There's all kind of different connecting things to why it feels good.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Oftentimes, it's directly related to an insecurity that I have,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   that I feel better about myself.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And when I talk negatively about someone who I'm a little bit jealous of
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   or someone who makes me insecure,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   or the fact that just I am insecure in general,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   and it's a self-esteem boost for me to put that other person down
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   and I can't believe it.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Did you see the car that he drives?
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Did you see the picture that she posted on Instagram?
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I mean, she's a great girl, but unbelievable.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And I feel better.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And Solomon says, "That's because gossip, man, it tastes good on the lips,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   but it's doing something to your soul.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   And it goes down deep and buries into the person who listens to it
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   and who pours it out."
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   That gossip, all the reasons why are not good reasons.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Other times, we do it because we've just been hurt.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Like, candidly, some of you guys gossip about people
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   who aren't even the ones who hurt you,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   but they remind you of somebody who hurts you.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   And so it just feels good to, "Man, I know their type,"
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   or, "I know what they're always like."
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   And you don't even know them.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   And yet we gossip.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Other times, it's just pride that I feel more self-righteous
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   if I can identify things in your life that are off
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   because it makes me feel better about myself.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And all the reasons and all the ways that it makes us feel good
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   have one thing in common.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   None of them are good or godly.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Other times, we just gossip because I kind of want to be the person
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   with the insider information, have you known?
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   And that really just reflects, I need the approval of another person.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   I need affirmation.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   And Solomon says, "Man, the reason why people gossip is that,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   man, it tastes good, it feels good to spill the tea,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   but it does something deep into your soul."
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   That's what the inner parts he's reflecting are.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   And it's a really brilliant analogy because he says,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   "Man, they're like desserts that you eat."
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   And what happens with desserts that you eat?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   All of these different chocolates, cakes, cookies have one thing in common.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   They taste amazing.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   And they have another thing in common, I guess, as well,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   that they last a moment on the lips and a lifetime on the hips.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   [laughter]
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Because they stick with you.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   And if you eat them and you consume them, they may taste good for a moment,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   but they are going to be sticking around, if you will.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   And if you were to eat all of them, it's going to make you sick.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And this is Solomon's point.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   "Man, you think you're just consuming the tea, and you heard about her,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   and did you know that they did this, and they slept together.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Can you believe that?"
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   And it goes down in a moment, but it goes deep into your soul.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   And it impacts the way that you see them.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   It impacts a deep soul level to you that it's just a moment on the lips,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   but it's going to stick.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And Solomon said it goes deep into the heart of a person.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   The second reason the Bible says that you and I gossip
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   is not just because it feels good,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   but because it leads to toxic stuff being poured into our heart,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   is Jesus says it's ultimately an issue of the heart.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   That a person, when they gossip, just like with anything that they say,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   it's not an issue of the mouth, it's an issue of the heart.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   He says in Matthew 15, starting in verse 18,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   "What comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart."
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   If you've got a word problem, you've got a heart problem.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   And this is what defiles a person.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   "For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   sexual immorality, false witness, slander, or gossip."
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And he says ultimately, if somebody's a gossip, they think,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   "Oh man, I just need to make sure I don't say that about her,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   or I need to not say that again."
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Jesus would say, "No, you've got a heart problem."
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   When a friend of ours bought their first house, a married couple,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   they moved in and they decided they wanted to put French doors
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   in the back of their house.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   And so they knocked down part of the wall and began to open it up
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   to put these French doors that were in, or these double doors.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   And they realized when they opened up the walls and they knocked that down,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   they could see in the walls, and it was infested with termites everywhere.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Thousands and thousands of dollars would have to be spent
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   in order to remove the termites,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   because it was literally rotting on the inside.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   And the picture Jesus gives of somebody who gossips
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   is there's a part inside of their heart that is rotting on the inside.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   And he's going to tell us how to remove that,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   and how he can be a part of removing that.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   But that's ultimately what it is.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   I mean, you think that you just don't like her because of the thing
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   that she posted, or because of the way that you interacted with her.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   And ultimately, the reason why you don't like her is because
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   she's in a dating relationship, and you've been single for a little bit,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   and you hold that against her.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   And you have jealousy that's in your heart.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Or you think that you just don't like him because he was rude,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   or he just puts off a vibe that you don't like.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   And ultimately, he reminds you of somebody who hurt you
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   or bullied you in your past.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   He reminds you of maybe some affirmation that you didn't get
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   from parents or something there.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   And I'm not trying to pick on you.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   I'm saying Jesus says whenever something's coming out of the mouth,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   it's coming from the heart.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   And a person who needs to find affirmation or who lives a life
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   and puts people down, talks negatively about them with them not there,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   has something rotten in their heart.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   And there's a way he prescribes for us to remove that.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   But it comes because it feels good or tastes good, Solomon would say,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   and because of an issue in the heart.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Then the results of gossip,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   which I think reflects why God is so passionate about this.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   In point two, the results of gossip.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Proverbs 16, verse 28 says this.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   "A troublemaker plants seeds of strife, of conflict."
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   I want you to listen to these next five words, six words.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   "Gossip separates the best of friends.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   That Solomon says gossip is such a powerful force
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   that you and that person that's your bestie,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   I mean, we are closer, thick as thieves, ride or die.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Gossip has the potential to get into that relationship
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   and completely erode it to where your best friend and you
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   are no longer even on talking terms.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   And it all happens through just seeds of distrust.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   And did you hear, and I can't believe,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   that it has the ability to divide like few other things the Scripture say.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   I don't know if there's another example in Scripture where it says,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   "Hey, you know what can divide the best friends out in the world?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   This, other than gossip."
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And God, who's for you and loves you and loves man,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   wants to know, the results of gossip is broken relationships.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And you think that you're just talking or you're just speaking off the cuff,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   and you're kind of just flippantly, and it's not that big of a deal,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   but it has the potential to destroy relationships in your life.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Because gossip can bring about and separate and divide.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   There was a saying in World War II that loose lips sink ships.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Basically, that saying originated from U.S. and U.K. or British naval fleets
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   who were trying to prevent German intelligence from listening to Morse code
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   or listening to radio signals and getting a hold of information
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   of different naval carriers or different warships that were out there.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And so they would say, "Hey, loose lips sink ships.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Be very careful how you communicate because British intelligence could identify, locate,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   and because you said it out loud, now a torpedo is taking out the boat."
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   And the same thing is true today.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Loose lips sink ships.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   It'll sink friendships and relationships that you have the ability with your words
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   to erode and destroy--maybe it's not even your friends.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   It's the friendships and the relationships with other people.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   And the Bible says in so many places we don't even have time
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   that it is gossip that leads to conflict, that leads to arguments,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   that leads to dysfunction, that leads to disunity.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Some of you guys see this every single day at your workplace,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   that are some incredibly toxic environments where people just gossip,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   and, "Did you hear?" and, "I cannot believe." and, "Man, what are they doing at that happy hour?"
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   And that's an okay thing when it comes to people who don't know God.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   But for Christians, God says it's not to be tolerated.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   There was a girl that joined our team about six years ago,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   and she was coming on to basically be a part of an internship program.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   And we were told by somebody, "Hey, this girl is going to join your team for the next year,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   and she lives in Florida, and so will you guys reach out?"
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   And so my entire team got in a conference room, and we called her, and she didn't answer.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   So we left a voicemail, and it was, "Hey, Elena was her name. We're so excited.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   You're going to be on our team. It's going to be awesome.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Can't wait for you to be here and move here next month and meet you in person."
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Done.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   And we began to talk and began to joke in a way that, candidly, was not great,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   in that we began to go, "Man, I wonder what she's doing.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Well, she's in Florida. She's probably on a beach somewhere.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   She's wearing a bikini, and now we're going to work at a church."
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   And she's like, "Oh, I've got a margarita and a bikini and can't answer this phone call."
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   And we just began to totally throw this girl under the bus in a joking, playful way,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   which often is the case.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   And then out of nowhere, I hear, "To send your message, press 1.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   To erase and re-record, press 2."
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   And all of us went, "Oh!"
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   And I walked, and it slowly--like, those moments where you're like,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   "I've got to make sure I hit 2, not 1, at the last minute," and pressed 2.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   "Hey, Elena. Can't wait to meet you. See you soon. Boop!"
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   And I think back on that, despite the fact that even the intentions were lighthearted.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Imagine if you had heard that and you were her,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   how you would feel walking into this new environment where you know no one,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   how you would think people think about you,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   even though those thoughts and those words weren't even really accurate,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   and they certainly weren't fair.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   And yet this is what happens all the time with people--gossip.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   It begins to make sense why God is so passionate about,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   "My people are not to be marked by gossip, by talking negative about someone who is not there."
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   I mean, the second thing it leads to--so broken relationships--is a poisoned perspective.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Think about the power of a perspective change that you can have through someone's words to you.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   If somebody was to find you after the service and say,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   "You know what? I heard David. He's a real jerk. He's having an affair on his wife."
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Whether that was true or not true,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   even though it wasn't true, you would leave here and go,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   "I don't know if I can trust this place, and that's messed up that he would be doing that."
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   And it would be based off of a lie--gossip.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And now you're going, "I don't even know if I can trust people who are talking about the Bible."
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   Watermark is a good example of this.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Watermark gets shade thrown at it all the time and just crazy stuff that is said
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   that, tragically, if people listen to are going to say,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   "Man, I'm going to walk away with this."
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   If you were to go on Yelp, you type in "Number 1 Colton Dallas,"
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   you know what pops up? Watermark.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   [laughter]
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Let me just say, thank you all for your support in getting us to number one.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   [laughter]
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   It wasn't easy, and we kept fighting.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   But think about that. Think about if somebody actually believed that,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   and they were like, "Oh, man, they're crazy. They're doing snakes. They're drinking Kool-Aid.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   It's just nuts." And they were like, "Man, I'm not going to that church."
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   And it's gossip, and it's toxic.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   And you know what's crazy?
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Those words were not written by somebody who's not a Christian.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   There aren't atheists out there going like, "Oh, yeah, you know, it's a cult."
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Those are written by Christians who are hurt for whatever reason,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   and hurt people hurt people.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   And hurt people, God says, are called to move towards people,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   and to love people, and to listen to people, and to care for people,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   and to be united with people.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   And so it leads to a poison perspective, and then finally,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   it leads to a corruption of your character.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Proverbs 11, verse 12 and 13, "A gossip goes telling secrets,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   but those who are trustworthy can keep a confidence."
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   In other words, a gossip is someone who is not worthy of trust.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   If somebody is gossiping to you, you need to know they will gossip about you.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And you may feel like, "No, they wouldn't. We're so close."
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Yes, they would.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   They've revealed, according to the Scripture, they're not someone who's trustworthy.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   And it corrupts your character.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   The Scripture says that the first example of gossip was Satan.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Why do I say that? Well, a couple reasons.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   One, the first example of somebody talking bad about someone behind their back
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   was Satan in the garden with Adam and Eve, to Eve,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   when they're sitting by a tree, and he says,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   "You know, did God really say, 'Don't eat the fruit'?
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Are we sure that He doesn't have some other motive going on
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   and doesn't want to keep good from you?
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   I bet it's because He's holding out.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   He can't be trusted."
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Furthermore, do you know what the Greek word for the devil is
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   in the New Testament, written in Greek?
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Diabolos.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Diabolos.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   It's a word that literally means "to cut through."
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Its Greek translation is "slanderer."
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   In other words, you read literature of Aristotle or different people
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   that you read the cliff notes for in high school,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   you read their work, and the word that they use for slander is diabolos,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   which literally means "dia," "to cut through," "bolos," "to separate."
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   He's the one who comes to separate, to divide, to create division.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   And any time we gossip, that is exactly what Satan wants you to do.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Not talk to people, talk about them, create division,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   and destroy relationships, which is the result of gossip.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Finally, I'm going to move quick.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   We've got to do the removal of gossip.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   How do we remove gossip?
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Well, first, I think an important aspect of this is you've got to be able to recognize it,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   because a lot of Christians, it's hard to know, like, what's in bounds?
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   What's gossip? When am I gossiping?
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   How do I, you know, vent, seek counsel?
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   What am I supposed to do?
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Can I not talk to anybody about anything?
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   How do I do that?
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   And I want to unpack as best I can some of the aspects of what the Bible says is in bounds,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   out of bounds, what are the instructions as it relates to gossip.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   And to do so, I'll explain it like this.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   This past Sunday, I went to a Stars game with my son.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   First Stars game, all-time.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   There he is, hanging out with a puck, cloud nine,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   slept with the puck that night, true story.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   And we're there at the game.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   He's so pumped.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   And I'd never been to a hockey game before.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   I don't know, just being from Houston, it's not something we did.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And so I'm at the game, and they have all these rules.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   And I knew things existed in hockey that I didn't quite understand,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   but they begin to call these fouls, like, man, that's off sides.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   And somebody's yelling, like, icing, icing.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   And I'm like, what is--I know it's not on the cake, icing.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   There's something else going on here.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   And I asked somebody for an explanation of what are the different rules.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   What's inbounds? What's off sides?
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   What's all that mean? And they begin to explain.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   So maybe this is for the person in the room who, like me,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   doesn't understand hockey, doesn't understand the rules.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Here's what it means to ice. Here's off sides.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Off sides, you enter into the offensive zone before they're icing.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   You hit it all the way down when there's no one there.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Who made these rules? I don't know.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   But what's my point?
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   My point is that in order to play the game,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   in order to not be in the penalty zone,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   you've got to understand the rules.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   You've got to understand the instructions.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   And many Christians don't understand the instructions.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And so from the Scripture, I want to walk through four principles
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   as it relates to recognizing gossip and removing it.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   So let me give you a few questions before I give you those four
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   that may help identify, man, I think I'm in gossip.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Is your conversation with friends about another person
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   intended to prepare you for a productive conversation with that person?
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   If not, it's probably gossip.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   If you're seeking counsel from others on how to deal wisely,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   because that's the challenge.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   We're like, man, am I venting? I'm getting counsel?
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   What would you do?
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   If you're seeking counsel from other people on how to do wisely,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   do you attempt as best you can to keep the person's name a secret?
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   If not, it's probably gossip.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   Is the tone of your voice and the posture of your heart
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   humble, brokenhearted over sharing another person's sin?
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Or do you feel frustration and need to vent
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   and even a little bit justified in how could they?
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   If so, it's probably gossip.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Finally, are you talking to God about this person
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   more than you're talking to anyone else?
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   If not, it may be gossip.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   So let me give four steps as it relates to identifying and removing gossip.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Number one, Christians talk to people, not about people.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   That we talk to people.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   If you have an offense against someone in your life,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   in your friendship, in their believer,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   you go to them.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   You talk to people, not about people.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Ephesians chapter four says,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   "Do not let anything unwholesome come out of your mouth,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   "but only what is helpful,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   "for building others up according to their needs,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   "that it may benefit those who listen."
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   That I talk to them directly for the purpose
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   of communicating what was done, how I felt, what was hurt,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   for the purpose of building one another up
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   and strengthening, building that relationship.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   If I'm talking to somebody else about a hurt that I have towards Josiah,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   I am sinning if I'm not willing to go to my brother
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   and communicate that.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Christians talk to people, not about people.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Number two, we talk only to people who are part of the problem
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   or the solution.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   You talk only to those who are part of the problem or the solution.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   That if they're not a part of resolving that conflict
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   or resolving and addressing that hurt,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   then they shouldn't be a part of the conversation.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Maybe they're speaking into your life and they're providing wise counsel,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   which would mean they're a part of the solution.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   But I've got to make sure that when I'm going
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   and I'm seeking counsel on how to handle things,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   I'm looking for people who will give me a bigger perspective,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   not validate what I'm saying.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   I'm looking for people who go,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   "I know that he didn't call you when he said he was going to call you,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   "but perhaps there's something else going on,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   "and maybe you should seek more understanding on what happened there."
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Not the guy who goes, "Yeah, what a jerk, man.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   "Unbelievable. He didn't call you?
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   "You should delete his number right now."
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And that's not helpful, that I need people and you need people.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   And I can know if it's venting or I'm getting wise counsel.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   If everything that they say is valid, yes, and it's feeding the fire.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   We talk people who are part of the problem and the solution.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Jesus says in Matthew 18, verse 15,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   "You should be very calculated on how you handle dealing with offenses against you,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   "and you should be very narrow in the path that you take in terms of approaching it."
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   He says this, "If your brother or sister sins,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   "go point out their fault just between the two of you.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   "If they listen, you've won them over.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   "If they will not listen, take one or two others along
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   "so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   "If they still refuse, then widen the circle more to the church,"
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   or in that context would have been akin to a small group.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   "If they refuse to listen, then treat them as you would a pagan or tax collector."
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   How did Jesus treat pagans and tax collectors? He loved them.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   And so then you treat them like, "Man, I'm going to still love you,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   "but I'm calling you and I'm identifying something that,"
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   collectively we're going, "This was wrong and this was in sin,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   "and we're not going to hold you accountable if you don't want to be held accountable anymore,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   "but I'm going to go to you and I'm going to talk with people who are part of the problem or the solution."
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Jesus says, "Do it privately, repeatedly, and widen the circle only as necessary."
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   People will say this, and I have said it before, and it's wrong.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   They'll say, "Look, I'm saying this," and look, I would say this to their face if they were here.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   It's still gossip, even if you would say it to their face if they were there.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   And so you should not say it when they're not there,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   and you should go say it to their face when they are.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   And Jesus says, "We talk to people, not about people.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   "We talk to people who are part of the problem or the solution."
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   And if somebody comes to you and shares gossip, you should ask them this question,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   "Why are you telling me this?"
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   In fact, let me save that for a second and go to the third one.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   The third one is, "We ask forgiveness when we fail."
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Because there's going to be times where I accidentally brought something up,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   and I said, you know, "Sam, JD," or, you know.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   I mentioned a comment, and when that happens, I need to pick up the phone,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   or I need to go find them and say, "Hey, I just need you to know.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   "I said this behind your back, and I should have said it to you.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   "Will you please forgive me?"
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   That when we fail, we ask for forgiveness, and we will.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   That's why we need a Savior. That's why Jesus came.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   And number four, "We don't tolerate"--perhaps the most broadly important,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   widely applicable in the entire room is we do not tolerate gossip from other people.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   You know what gossip always has in common? Two people.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   And if you're listening to gossip, you're gossiping.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   You don't have to be the dispenser of the tea.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   If you're consuming it, you're gossiping.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   And as Christians, we can go, "I'm not going to be safe for your gossip."
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   You can bring that up, and I'm going to ask a question, "What do you want me to do with that?
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   "Do you want to go together and talk to them?
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   "Are you asking me to give you some counsel right now?
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   "Because I'm not going to sit here and allow this to poison the perspective that I have on that person."
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Because we don't tolerate gossip.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Titus 3--I don't have time to go into it, but Paul basically says,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   "A divisive person in church has three strikes."
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Correct him once, 3 verses 10 and 11.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Correct him twice. If he doesn't listen, then he should not be a part of the body.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   In Proverbs 26, it says, "A fire goes out without wood,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   "and gossip, without it, a conflict dies down."
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   He's basically saying, "Hey, Christians have a responsibility
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   "to not start the fire and be like a lighter.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   "We have a responsibility to be like a fire extinguisher."
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   And a lot of us in the room, like, "You're not just a lighter.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   "You are like a lighter fluid. You are a flamethrower on stuff.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   "And you're just stirring it up, and I can't believe."
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   And those of us who want to do what Jesus says have a responsibility.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   When somebody comes to gossip and they say,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   "Hey, I can't believe this happened," or, "Man, you're not going to believe what I heard,"
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   then we go, "Whoosh, whoosh, and I'm not going to tolerate it."
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   When I came to Watermark, I saw something modeled for the very first time
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   that I honestly had never seen before over a decade ago.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   I came on staff, and I said a comment one day.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   It's the first year of work, first maybe month of work,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   and I made a comment about the way somebody was or the way that they had hurt me.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   And the person I was with said, "Hey, let me stop you. Have you told them that?"
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   And I said, "No, you know, no."
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   And he said, "Okay, you've got 24 hours,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   "and if in 24 hours you haven't told them that, then I'm going to tell them that,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   "and we're going to go together, and I'm going to make sure that he knows,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   "that now I know, that he thinks that you've hurt him
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   "or you don't care about him in that regard."
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   And it did something really interesting on our staff.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   It made gossip not safe, because people began to go,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   "Oh, my gosh, can you believe that? Oh, no, oh, no, I don't want to go, I don't want to go."
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And people began to go, "I don't want to go do that."
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   In a beautiful, healthy way, people began to recognize,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   "Oh, man, gossip is toxic, it's poison,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   "and we have a loving responsibility to one another that I'm going to call you
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   "and remind you to do that."
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   So much of your life, sadly, and my life,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   has been lived through the lens of a poisoned perspective,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   that you listen to the words that somebody else said about someone else,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   and you believe that, and now you see them that way.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   And they may not even still see them that way.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   God says that followers of Christ have been adopted in the family of Jesus.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   When people, or if people were to talk bad about my children,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   I would have an emotional response of indignation or anger,
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   because, "How dare you talk about my princess daughter like that?"
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   It makes sense when you think God says that you are the sons and daughters of God.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Every time that you gossip as Christians,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   you are talking about one of the children of God.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   What response do you think a good, loving, heavenly Father would have?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   In conclusion, the reasons we gossip flow from the heart.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   The result is broken relationships, a poisoned perspective,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   and the removal happens one step at a time.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   There was one occasion, and I'll land the plane here,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   where Jesus prays something really unique,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   and he does so when he brings up you.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   And by that, I don't mean he brings up Carl or Kyle.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   He brings up future believers in the church,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   and he talks about you behind your back.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   And I want to look at what he says.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   It's in the context of John 17, and he prays,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   and he brings up praying for his disciples,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   and then he says, "I want to pray for anyone down the road who will ever believe."
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   And look at what he prays.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   "I'm not only praying for these disciples,"
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   verse 20 of chapter 17, John,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   "but also for all who will ever believe in me through their message, through the gospel."
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   That's the death and resurrection of Christ.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   That's anyone who is trusted.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Jesus died on the cross for their sin, paid for all of it, past, present, future.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   He came back alive, showing the check cleared.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Anyone who accepts that message, I want to pray for.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   That's what he just said.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   And look at what he prays next.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   "I pray that they will all be one.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   They will be united just as you, God, and I are," Jesus speaking.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   "As you are in me and I am in you,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   I pray that they would be in us so the world will believe you sent me.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   I've given them the glory you gave me so that they may be one as we are.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   I'm in them and you're in me.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   May they experience such," look at this, "such perfect unity."
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Why? "That the world will know you sent me," Jesus,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   "and that you love them as much as you love me."
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   God, would you allow them to be so united together
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   that relationships wouldn't be divided like the enemy wants to happen?
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   They'd be so united, so for each other, so pursuing each other,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   so believing the best about each other, so connected together,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   that the world would look on and go,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   "You guys are so different from everybody else.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Everyone else is in conflict. Everyone else is fighting.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Everyone else negatively interprets.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Everyone else assumes the worst.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Everyone else gossips behind their back, and yet you guys stand out."
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   The only rational explanation is the thing that you have in common,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   which is Jesus, and the world will see the Savior of the world.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   Gossip, ironically, it's the opposite of Christ-like love.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Gossip is saying, "And I hold their sins against them."
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Do you believe that? Do you believe what they did?
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Jesus says, "I don't hold your sins against you."
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   The gossip says, "Man, I am strong because they're weak."
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   And Jesus, in Christianity, says that as believers in Christ,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   we get to declare, "I am weak, but my God is strong."
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   And because of that, I'm not defined by what people think.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   I'm not defined by my past mistakes,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   and I'm not going to define you by yours.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   And I'm going to run towards you in love and truth and not gossip,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   because we rest in peace to gossip.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Let me pray.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Father, I thank you that you modeled perfectly.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   If anyone could have come up and shown, pointed out all the sins
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   and the wrongs and errors of people, it's the perfect Son of God.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   And yet, on this earth, you modeled patience, love, kindness.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   And I pray for anyone in the room who has not had a moment
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   where they stepped into that relationship with you,
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   that first and foremost, above any instructions on gossip,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   they would receive the gift that you offered.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   I pray that you would allow friends here who need to go ask for forgiveness from people
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   because they have gossips, to take that step.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   I pray for relationships that maybe haven't talked in months or years
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   would be restored and reconciled through the power of your Spirit,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   just working and softening hearts and moving people together.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   I pray that your church would be united
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   and that we would do everything as far as it depends on us
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   to be people who run towards each other in love and speak the truth and not gossip.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   We worship you now in song. Amen.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:29.500]   Amen.
