00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:15,040
 All right, what's up, friends of the room?

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,760
 Check, check, check.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,880
 Friends in Fort Worth, El Paso, Phoenix, Arkansas, wherever

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,560
 you are joining us from, glad that you are tuning in as we

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,280
 wrap up this self-care series.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,160
 Let's go.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,920
 Got a treadmill on stage, joggers on, game time.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,120
 Hey, any iPhone fans in this room?

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,440
 Love it.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,400
 Any Android people?

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:50,000
 You guys, you guys are dismissed right now.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,800
 That's how we're going to start.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,600
 You're ruining text message groups everywhere, OK?

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,320
 We can't-- and we're all upset about it.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,640
 So when this is done, you are putting your phone on this

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,040
 stage and getting an iPhone, because we

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,840
 want to be able to name our group texts,

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,040
 and it's really frustrating.

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,200
 I love this thing, man.

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,560
 I don't know.

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,040
 I've never actually used an Android,

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,760
 so I'm just going to speak as though they

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,680
 work kind of like an iPhone.

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,120
 But this thing is amazing.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,120
 I mean, the fact that we live in 2019

27
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,920
 has some serious perks to it.

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,720
 I mean, you think about days when

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,480
 you had the Razr, that huge car phone that you drive around.

30
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,960
 It's like a huge brick that people would answer and talk on

31
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,320
 or Zack Morris style.

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,080
 And just how the smartphone has so changed the game.

33
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,600
 Like, as I was just thinking through,

34
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,560
 the things that I can do while I'm standing in line

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,280
 at Walgreens are unbelievable compared

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,040
 to what you would have to log on to the internet.

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,640
 Remember dial-up internet?

38
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,680
 Anybody old enough to remember that?

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,800
 Where you would just wait for all the--

40
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,240
 I can't even emulate the sounds--

41
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,040
 to come online and America Online

42
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,200
 and all the different AIM.

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,280
 But today, you can be standing in line at CVS,

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,520
 and you could be like, man, I think I'm out of soap at home.

45
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,760
 And this soap is more expensive here.

46
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,160
 I'm just going to order Amazon Prime now,

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,560
 and it'll be there in two hours.

48
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,680
 Like, you can pull your phone out right now.

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,440
 You could have groceries waiting for you when you get home.

50
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,560
 Think about that.

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,840
 The fact that you get home, there's no food, no problem.

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
 You got Uber Eats.

53
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,280
 You got Favor.

54
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,480
 You got options.

55
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,520
 The fact that you have Waze app.

56
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,560
 Any Waze fans in the house?

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,800
 We are excited about Waze.

58
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,200
 Let's go.

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,600
 No traffic for you.

60
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,560
 The fact that, like, you can wonder, hey,

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,120
 what are the symptoms of measles?

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,400
 I don't have to wonder.

63
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,280
 I can look them up.

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,520
 WebMD, it's on my phone.

65
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,720
 I've got access.

66
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,560
 I can find out, hey, what position did Ryan Gosling play

67
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,600
 in Remember the Titans?

68
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,920
 I don't have to wonder anymore.

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,160
 I can just immediately-- it's all right here.

70
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,600
 Wherever you're sitting right now,

71
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,560
 you have access to that type of information.

72
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,160
 You want to know how to cook crawfish?

73
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
 Just YouTube it.

74
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,600
 You want to know what the best sushi place in town?

75
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,400
 Yelp.

76
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,960
 I mean, just all the different things

77
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,560
 that are at your fingertips, from just what's

78
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,120
 the population of Vermont to who invented the Oreo,

79
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,880
 it's only a couple clicks away.

80
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,000
 And I don't know--

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,560
 or I do know I am not the only one who loves this thing.

82
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,840
 Because if you pay any attention--

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,240
 like, just next time you're at a restaurant, look around.

84
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,960
 And if you see, like, a group of friends,

85
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,080
 what are they all doing?

86
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,680
 The same thing.

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,240
 Everyone is, like, sitting there like this,

88
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,560
 either talking to people around them or just looking up,

89
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,120
 like, hey, what's the best thing that the tips on Yelp

90
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,800
 is telling me to eat here right now?

91
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,320
 You drive around.

92
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,200
 I mean, the scariest thing is next time you're

93
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,480
 in the car during the day, look around.

94
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,080
 Everyone is driving and texting all the time.

95
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,000
 Like, everyone is on their phone.

96
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,280
 It's terrifying.

97
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,120
 But we're all constantly like, oh, man, I'm looking this up,

98
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,760
 or I'm checking my Instagram likes,

99
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,920
 or I'm checking on what's a faster way to get there,

100
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,000
 or just looking up random information on Wikipedia

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,400
 and the, like, vortex that you get sucked into there

102
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,200
 after click after click.

103
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,600
 But the crazy thing is as much as you're able to get done,

104
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,880
 as much as this is, like, added benefit to our lives--

105
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,160
 I know, at least for me, it comes at a real cost.

106
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,680
 Like, if I'm not careful, this thing

107
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,120
 will distract me from the people I'm around.

108
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,400
 It'll distract you from ever been, like, at a place,

109
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,800
 at a concert maybe, or you're at, like, an amazing,

110
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,600
 a beautiful place, a beautiful environment.

111
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,360
 And instead of focusing on the music and the concert,

112
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,480
 you're just trying to take a video

113
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,680
 to make sure that you can upload it to your Insta stories,

114
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,920
 or you're at, like, some beautiful,

115
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,800
 here's the Grand Canyon, instead of really, like,

116
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,400
 taking it in and, man, God, this is amazing.

117
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,440
 You're over there trying to choose

118
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,040
 what filter to put on it.

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,040
 As much as this thing adds to our life,

120
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,720
 it also comes at a cost.

121
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,960
 And I know for me, it comes at a cost

122
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,440
 of some pretty important arenas in life.

123
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,280
 Relationally, it can distract you

124
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,760
 from the people that you're around, from me,

125
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,840
 wife, children, from you, friends, relationships,

126
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,400
 family members, how much of your time,

127
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,960
 or of our time when you go home for family on vacation,

128
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,120
 are you spent just kinda, like,

129
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,520
 checking out what there is to do around you

130
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,520
 and what everyone else is doing?

131
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,880
 And the reason I start there is 'cause tonight,

132
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,400
 we're gonna talk about a subject

133
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,680
 about things in life that drain the life out of you.

134
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,760
 And I'm convinced, just after studying it,

135
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,720
 how much this is draining the life out of you.

136
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,000
 It allows us to get, really, sometimes,

137
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,720
 the most out of life while sacrificing

138
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,440
 the most important things.

139
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,920
 And so what I wanna do right now

140
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,880
 is have everyone in the room take their phone out,

141
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,080
 even the Android people.

142
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,440
 And I wanna challenge you to do something

143
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,360
 we've never done on the boards.

144
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,440
 I want you to turn your phone off.

145
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,920
 Not put it on airplane, I know,

146
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,560
 it just gasps, went out everywhere.

147
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,880
 It's like, what, oh my gosh, are you kidding me?

148
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,400
 What kinda church is this?

149
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,160
 Turn off the phone, it's gonna be a short message,

150
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,520
 like 30 minutes.

151
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,800
 And I know what you're thinking.

152
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,680
 Hey, I'm being serious.

153
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,800
 Take your phone out right now, turn it off.

154
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,120
 And you're thinking, as you're nervously moving around,

155
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,000
 there's even a phobia.

156
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Here's what's crazy.

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,960
 We all are panicked about, oh my gosh,

158
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,200
 what am I gonna do without my phone?

159
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,320
 There's even a phobia been named nomophobia.

160
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,680
 No mobile phobia.

161
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,920
 Here you go, here you go, here you go.

162
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,640
 But turn it off, and you're wondering,

163
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,920
 what if he texts me back?

164
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,760
 That text message is gonna wait for you

165
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,040
 when you turn it back on.

166
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,960
 What if your mom calls?

167
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,640
 There's gonna be a voicemail waiting for you.

168
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,760
 You can call her back.

169
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,560
 Whenever those things don't get lost.

170
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,000
 Jason Mraz, did you get my message?

171
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,160
 It is not a thing.

172
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,320
 They stay around and stay on the phone.

173
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,600
 You're probably even more likely thinking,

174
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,960
 what if you're boring, David?

175
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
 What am I gonna do?

176
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,000
 That's fair.

177
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,960
 And that may be a real challenge,

178
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,360
 but at least it's gonna be a shorter time.

179
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,240
 Or maybe you're like,

180
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,280
 well, what if there's a national emergency?

181
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,960
 We've thought through everything, folks,

182
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,720
 because Billy, our tech director,

183
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,320
 he's gonna keep his phone on so you don't have to.

184
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,520
 And we've got friends.

185
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,680
 (audience applauding)

186
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,600
 For your service, Billy.

187
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,120
 Outside of the room who are committed to letting us know

188
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,560
 if there's a national emergency,

189
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,280
 if the US decides to go to war,

190
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,400
 he's gonna let us know,

191
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,560
 and we'll make sure to pass that on to you

192
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,200
 for the next 30 minutes.

193
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,160
 I just want you to tune in as we talk about things

194
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,960
 that drain the life out of us.

195
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,200
 And the good news will be,

196
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,400
 you won't be draining the life out of your phone

197
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,200
 while you're doing that, 'cause it'll be off.

198
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,440
 But just like it is possible for a battery in your phone

199
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,040
 to get drained, many of us walked into the room tonight,

200
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,840
 and there are things, in addition to the phone,

201
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,240
 and our constant distractions that come from it,

202
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,280
 that are draining the life out of you.

203
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,920
 They're draining the joy out of you, the peace out of you,

204
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,360
 and it is not the way that God wants you to live.

205
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,000
 And so we wanted to wrap up this series

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,200
 by just covering some of the things,

207
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,440
 the most key arenas, or some of the most key arenas

208
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,760
 where your life is just being sucked out of you,

209
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,960
 because there is a solution,

210
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,880
 and God's word discusses how you and I can experience

211
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,320
 not being drained of life, but being filled with it.

212
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,280
 So tonight, we're gonna cover two drains,

213
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,440
 and then really one thing that if you and I commit to it,

214
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,320
 is the thing that ultimately fills

215
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,080
 and sustains us in life.

216
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,360
 And it's gonna come from a story

217
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,520
 that is found in Luke chapter 10.

218
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,400
 If you grew up in church,

219
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,040
 you may be familiar with this story.

220
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,440
 It's a story that involves two sisters.

221
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,360
 And inside of this story,

222
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,760
 one of the sisters gives us two examples

223
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,840
 of some of the things that still today

224
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,280
 drain the life out of you and drain the life out of me.

225
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,760
 And then the other sister gives us the thing

226
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,160
 that all throughout the Bible, really,

227
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,240
 it's indicated that if you and I commit to this one thing,

228
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,800
 you will consistently experience being charged,

229
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
 energized in life.

230
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,640
 No matter the circumstances that you face,

231
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,720
 no matter what you walk through.

232
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,760
 So we're gonna look at these two things that drain us,

233
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,900
 and then one thing that helps sustain us

234
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,620
 in the midst of that found in Luke chapter 10

235
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,680
 will be in verse 38.

236
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,600
 If you don't have a Bible,

237
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,640
 the verses will be up on the screen.

238
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,680
 If you do not own a Bible,

239
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,480
 there's Bibles out in the Welcome Center here in Dallas.

240
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,960
 They should be someone Fort Worth,

241
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,960
 and the rest of you guys are on your own.

242
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,080
 But there is an app for that,

243
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,640
 but you shouldn't be using your Bible app

244
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,800
 'cause it'll be up on the screens.

245
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,780
 I'm talking to you too and all the locations.

246
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,700
 Make sure that your phone is off.

247
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,900
 We'll start in verse 38.

248
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:58,160
 As Jesus and his disciples were on their way,

249
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,100
 he came to a village where a woman named Martha

250
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,140
 opened her phone to him.

251
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,320
 (laughing)

252
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,020
 Oh man, I can't go without the phone talking about it.

253
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,200
 (laughing)

254
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,400
 Opened her phone to Jesus.

255
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,200
 Martha, you are always opening that phone.

256
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,400
 Martha, Martha.

257
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,640
 That was for some of you.

258
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,480
 All right, I digress.

259
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,720
 Okay, a woman named Martha opened her home to him.

260
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,800
 She had a sister named Mary

261
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,160
 who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.

262
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,660
 But Martha was distracted by all the preparations

263
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,280
 that had to be made.

264
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,840
 She came to him and asked,

265
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,000
 "Lord, don't you care," this is Martha speaking,

266
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,680
 "that my sister has left me to do all of the work

267
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,240
 "while she's sitting there at your feet?

268
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,040
 "Tell her to help me."

269
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,720
 Martha, Martha, Jesus said.

270
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,220
 The Lord answered,

271
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,520
 "You are worried and upset about many things,

272
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,540
 "but few things are needed, or indeed only one.

273
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,380
 "Mary has chosen what is better,

274
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,480
 "and it will not be taken away from her."

275
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,240
 So if you grew up in church, you may have heard this story.

276
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,160
 Jesus goes through town, shows up,

277
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,400
 and Martha, who has this house,

278
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,280
 invites Jesus and all of his disciples into the home,

279
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,480
 and Jesus begins kinda teaching the disciples,

280
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,120
 and Mary, her sister, is not helping her put together,

281
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,440
 like, what are we gonna serve Jesus

282
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,120
 and his friends or his boys?

283
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,320
 Do we have some pita bread, some hummus?

284
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,520
 What are we gonna give these guys?

285
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,080
 Mary's in there just sitting at the feet of Jesus

286
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,840
 while Martha, who again owns the home,

287
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,560
 is the one preparing and going through

288
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,920
 all the different preparations that need to take place.

289
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,760
 Comes to Jesus and says, "Hey, what's the deal?

290
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,900
 "My sister in here is basically being a hippie

291
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,000
 "sitting at your feet, and I need some help in the kitchen

292
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,040
 "sweeping things up.

293
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,120
 "Will you tell her to help me?"

294
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,440
 Begins bossing Jesus around.

295
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,560
 Jesus says, "Hey, she's chosen something better

296
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,860
 "than all the things that are weighing

297
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,260
 "and distracting you down."

298
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,600
 When I read that story, initially,

299
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,880
 there's something about Martha that I resonate with,

300
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,760
 and probably a lot of us do,

301
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,000
 partly because we live in a world

302
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,160
 that everyone celebrates Martha,

303
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,840
 or celebrates not Martha in this story,

304
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,200
 but kinda Martha's in general.

305
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,040
 What do I mean by Martha?

306
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,880
 I mean like a go-getter.

307
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,120
 Like, Martha's the girl that you want on your staff.

308
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,860
 She's the girl that you wanna work with,

309
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,640
 work alongside, she's getting after it.

310
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,260
 I mean, she owns the home.

311
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,940
 She's got the mortgage, she's paying the bills.

312
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,240
 Mary's a freeloader sitting in there.

313
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,780
 (congregation laughing)

314
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,720
 There's a lot to respect about Martha.

315
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,920
 I feel like Martha's somebody that has drive and ambition,

316
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,020
 she's getting after it, and Mary's just over there

317
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,220
 like a wallflower, sitting around doing nothing.

318
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,940
 And I look at Martha, and I'm like,

319
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,640
 "Man, I feel for Martha."

320
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,640
 But the tragedy is that in trying to get

321
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,840
 all these different things done,

322
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,200
 she was distracted from the one who's most important,

323
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,160
 and it ended up costing her.

324
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,960
 And the same thing is relevant for you and for me.

325
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,160
 That although there's some things that are qualities,

326
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,560
 and the Bible here in the story,

327
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
 the point of the story is not that,

328
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,720
 "Hey, you shouldn't ever get things done,

329
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,160
 "and have drive, and have ambition for things."

330
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,840
 The point of the story is to not max out your life

331
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
 and miss out on what is most important.

332
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,320
 And Martha, we're told, the first adjective described of her

333
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,640
 was she was distracted by many things.

334
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,000
 The word distracted is the first thing

335
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,960
 I just wanna talk about, the first drain

336
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,720
 that is gonna come for you in your life,

337
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,760
 the first thing that's sucking energy out of you right now

338
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,640
 is the idea of you being distracted.

339
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,720
 What's distracted mean?

340
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,360
 It literally is a word that means pulled

341
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,920
 in many different directions.

342
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,800
 There's a French word for torture that was called,

343
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,660
 if they really wanted to torture someone,

344
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,080
 they would distract them, and they would tie ropes

345
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,880
 to each of their limbs, their legs and their arms,

346
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,040
 and they would have horses run in every direction

347
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,280
 and pull them apart, and it was called distraction.

348
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,120
 It means pulled in different directions.

349
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,560
 The first thing that is gonna drain

350
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,400
 and suck the life out of you is being pulled

351
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,240
 in a million different directions

352
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,200
 at the expense of something or the things

353
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,440
 that are most important in your life.

354
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,560
 The first thing I just wanna talk about

355
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,320
 is being drained from distractions.

356
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,240
 For Martha, what a tragedy that the Son of God,

357
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,760
 the most important person in all of human history,

358
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,120
 comes into her house, and instead of focusing on Him,

359
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,520
 she's distracted by, you know, I need to make sure

360
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,960
 that I'm cleaning the floors in here,

361
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,520
 getting something to eat, all the different preparations,

362
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,140
 and misses out on being around Jesus,

363
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,980
 the one that all of human history

364
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,080
 would restart the calendar around,

365
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,960
 because distractions, distractions that were draining

366
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,160
 and pulling at you, and here's where this is so relevant

367
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,460
 and more relevant than ever before.

368
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,040
 It's like you are constantly being distracted

369
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,120
 and gonna be tempted to be distracted away

370
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,200
 from focusing on Jesus, focusing on your faith,

371
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,280
 focusing on the things that really matter,

372
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,600
 because not only did you walk in here

373
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,160
 and social media's pulling at you,

374
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,320
 and there's a million different things

375
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,800
 that you should be checking right now,

376
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,220
 million different things you should be focusing on,

377
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,960
 some of you already turned your phone back on.

378
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,160
 You're like, ah, it's been a minute and a half,

379
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,120
 can't take it anymore, and they're pulling

380
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,220
 for all of your attention, and if that wasn't enough,

381
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,320
 there's just things in life that are gonna constantly

382
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,360
 be pulling for your attention.

383
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,840
 They're not even bad things.

384
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,100
 They're realities of things.

385
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,000
 Graham, you come up here, and I'll show you what I mean.

386
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,960
 There's things that all of us kinda came into the room

387
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,080
 and whether it's our job, whether it's where we work,

388
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,560
 they're gonna pull for our attention,

389
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,000
 and if you are not careful to focus

390
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,100
 in the midst of distraction, your life,

391
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,440
 on the things that matter most,

392
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,680
 you may max out your life, but you will miss out

393
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,900
 on the things that are most important,

394
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,360
 because you can only handle so much,

395
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,480
 and so the key, or the remedy, the solution

396
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,120
 for being drained from distraction is focusing,

397
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,000
 focusing your life not on the things

398
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,520
 that you need to get done, not on your to-do list,

399
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,400
 but focusing your life every single day,

400
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,600
 what are the things Jesus wants me to do?

401
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,960
 At the end of the day, I'm not responsible

402
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,200
 for getting every single thing that I need

403
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,600
 to get done on my to-do list and all my car registration,

404
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,720
 and when am I gonna do my taxes,

405
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,520
 and all the different million things

406
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,200
 that are fighting for your attention.

407
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,560
 If it comes at the expense of you doing

408
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,000
 what Jesus wants you to do, and I'm gonna talk about it

409
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,800
 in a second what those are gonna be,

410
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,480
 but in this scenario, I just had Graham jump on here,

411
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,240
 where this is a treadmill, and the treadmill represents

412
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,200
 kind of that all of the life, Billy,

413
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,640
 I don't think this is working.

414
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,200
 Okay, Graham's gonna run on a broken treadmill

415
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,920
 for a second, and if he begins to run,

416
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,000
 (laughing)

417
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,640
 hey, this guy is a Martha, I'll tell you

418
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,800
 that much right there, he is not settling

419
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,960
 for this thing not working, I don't know

420
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,860
 that it's gonna work, Billy, we good?

421
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,280
 (audience laughing)

422
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,760
 Okay, so here's what would happen, in life,

423
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,880
 let's say this treadmill is moving all at the same pace,

424
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,560
 or let's say it's moving, life in general,

425
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,560
 it's gonna move at five miles an hour, six miles an hour,

426
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,000
 it's not moving in general right now, thank you, Billy,

427
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 you saved us from war, but you didn't save the treadmill,

428
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,680
 and so Graham's gonna pick up different things,

429
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,640
 but he's limited in what he can carry,

430
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,960
 like he's gonna run, life is gonna run

431
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,880
 at the same pace for all of us,

432
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,080
 all of us have 24 hours a day,

433
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,000
 every single person in this room,

434
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,400
 including Graham, including Beyonce,

435
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,080
 everybody's got 24 hours a day and seven days a week,

436
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,800
 and so you've gotta decide, hey, what are the things

437
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,680
 that I'm going to carry, the things that I can handle,

438
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,080
 so Graham's, he's got his Bible,

439
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,420
 he's got a commitment to God's word,

440
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,740
 then he's candle, he's gotta put attention towards a job,

441
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,840
 there's his work represented, here's a relationship maybe,

442
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,980
 where he's got some box of chocolates and dating,

443
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,280
 and he's focused, hopefully he's got a girl,

444
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,800
 then he needs to be involved in church,

445
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,640
 and he's carrying that, and not,

446
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,360
 the relationship's falling apart already,

447
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,880
 and he's got his side hustle job here,

448
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,280
 then you need to have some sort of health life

449
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,760
 and fitness and maybe a social life over here,

450
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,800
 and then you got Topo Chico, not sure why that's in there,

451
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,720
 then we've got a dog, you gotta care for,

452
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,640
 and a million different things,

453
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
 and then on top of all of that,

454
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,880
 he's got social media that's gotta get his attention,

455
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,160
 Graham, if you could run a little harder

456
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,660
 and try a little harder, maybe that dating relationship

457
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,360
 would work out a little more in your favor.

458
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,360
 (audience laughing)

459
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,660
 Wow, and you saved the phone.

460
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,080
 (audience laughing)

461
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,560
 Way to go, isn't that life?

462
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,680
 Everything falls apart, but you hold onto the phone.

463
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,060
 Man, that illustration went perfectly.

464
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:01,360
 But here's the point, you can only carry so many things.

465
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,720
 You can only carry so many things,

466
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,220
 so the choice is what am I going to prioritize,

467
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,220
 what are the things that I'm not gonna let go of?

468
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,880
 Because if I try to carry too many things,

469
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,640
 you're gonna drop something,

470
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,160
 and often you either don't have a choice

471
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,040
 of the things that you drop,

472
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,080
 or you end up dropping the things that are most important.

473
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,320
 The first thing to go is your relationship with God,

474
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,240
 or maybe it's the connection to church or other believers,

475
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,720
 your relationship to people around you,

476
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,880
 and you have got to focus,

477
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,000
 not on all the things that you need to get done,

478
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,200
 but every day asking the question,

479
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,380
 Lord, what does Jesus want me to do today?

480
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,980
 What does it look like to live out or to fulfill the things,

481
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,400
 not all that's on my to-do list

482
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,660
 and everything hanging over my head,

483
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,860
 but just today, what does God want from me?

484
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,160
 Here's some of the things that God wants from you today,

485
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,760
 for you to walk in relationship with him,

486
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,920
 for you to know him, for you to spend time in his word.

487
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,280
 Here's something else that Jesus,

488
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,160
 oh, we all came into the room,

489
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,620
 and what, oh, we have all these different things

490
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,260
 we need to get done, and our side hustles,

491
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,200
 and we need to make sure that we're posting

492
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,720
 and keeping up with all the people around us,

493
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,360
 but what does Jesus want from me today?

494
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,720
 Not those things.

495
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,360
 He wants a relationship with you.

496
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,140
 He wants you focused on caring for people around you.

497
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,200
 Another thing Jesus wants, he wants you to sleep.

498
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,320
 He wants you to rest.

499
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,040
 Psalm 127, verse two says this,

500
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,440
 that it is in vain to stay up late into the night

501
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,160
 and rise early, toiling for food to eat,

502
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,300
 because God, that's he,

503
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,820
 some of you guys should memorize this verse,

504
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,040
 some of you maybe already have,

505
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,000
 he gives to his beloved even in their sleep,

506
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,380
 or he grants sleep to those who he loves.

507
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,400
 That at the end of the day, you've got a million things

508
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
 that are gonna fight for your attention

509
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,360
 in the question before you, in the question before you.

510
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,920
 Jesus, what do you want from me right now?

511
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,480
 'Cause my mind is racing of all the different distractions

512
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,440
 that are fighting for my attention constantly,

513
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,480
 and I have the choice.

514
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,920
 Here's where I'm at, empowered and have the choice.

515
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,980
 What am I going to give my attention towards?

516
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,840
 What am I gonna prioritize my attention?

517
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,960
 Am I gonna choose to prioritize,

518
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,800
 I'm not letting go of my relationship with God,

519
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,320
 I'm not letting go of my relationship with other believers,

520
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,480
 I'm gonna prioritize those things, even if it costs me,

521
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,100
 even if that means changing jobs.

522
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,600
 Because week after week, I talk with many of you

523
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,760
 who come down and you'll share about,

524
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,920
 hey, this is where I'm at in life,

525
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,840
 and you're working 80 to 90 hours a week,

526
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,920
 and you're like, I can't really serve,

527
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,280
 I can't get plugged into a church,

528
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,920
 I'm confident that the God who's there

529
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,720
 does not want you to live that life.

530
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,460
 And so you don't have to drive a certain car,

531
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,580
 you don't have to live in a certain house,

532
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,520
 there are things that God wants from you.

533
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,520
 And the question is, the way that you and I can have

534
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,040
 focus from distraction is by focusing

535
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,160
 not on all that needs to be done,

536
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,400
 not on everything around me,

537
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,320
 but what does Jesus want from me today?

538
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,280
 What does Jesus call me to today?

539
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,200
 It's not dissimilar to this, it's like,

540
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,380
 my wife will at times send me and say,

541
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,720
 hey, will you go to the store and we need you

542
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,840
 to go get diapers and wipes or food or whatever it is.

543
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,280
 And she'll give me a list of, hey, here's the things

544
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,320
 I gotta go, I'll go to Target, here I go, step in,

545
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,160
 I'm looking around.

546
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,400
 And if I was to take my list and I go to Target

547
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,380
 and all of a sudden, I'm just bombarded by like,

548
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,720
 oh, look at these, they've got, you know,

549
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,720
 a whole new Magnolia line and just these pants are on sale

550
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,960
 and those are pretty cool, Meroma, never heard of that.

551
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,960
 And I just begin to like, go through all the different store

552
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,920
 and I fill up my basket and I use my time

553
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,640
 not to get the things on the list,

554
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,880
 but things that I was like, I do need some more of that,

555
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
 I need some more socks, we need trash bags.

556
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,880
 And I fill up my basket with things that I think I need,

557
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,760
 but things that are not on the wants or on the list

558
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,900
 that my wife has given me, I've failed.

559
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,000
 I missed out on the purpose, the reason why I'm at Target

560
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,200
 in the first place, in the same way,

561
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,040
 how many of us go through life and you will fulfill

562
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,080
 all kinds of different things, you've got an amazing car,

563
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,080
 you've got a great job, you may have a great relationship,

564
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,000
 dating relationship, maybe you're listening online

565
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,160
 and you've got a sweet pad that you're living in right now

566
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,600
 and you are experiencing everything the world thinks

567
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,100
 you need and everything that maybe you're like,

568
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,800
 this is awesome, this is where life is found.

569
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,600
 And you're not reading and doing the things in the list.

570
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,880
 And you are failing and you are missing out

571
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,160
 on everything that God wants from you,

572
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,640
 you are missing out on the peace that comes

573
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,440
 when you would just simply say, I'm not gonna focus

574
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,800
 on what everything else needs to be done,

575
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,320
 I'm just gonna focus, Jesus, what do you want me to do?

576
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,640
 I promise, if you will begin to ask that question,

577
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,000
 focus your attention on that, you will experience peace.

578
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,580
 I didn't get everything there was to get done,

579
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,100
 my car registration is still in need of being changed,

580
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,960
 but I was faithful today, in this conversation,

581
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,800
 in this moment.

582
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,120
 One of the things that's gonna drain and suck the life

583
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,000
 out of you is a constant distraction

584
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,040
 from the things that matter most.

585
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,640
 And you will max out your life, but you will also miss out

586
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,600
 in life on the things that matter most.

587
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,400
 Francis Chan, who's gonna be joining us at Awaken,

588
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,980
 and is a good friend if you've been hanging around

589
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,040
 for the poor, or has been with us before, said this,

590
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,800
 our greatest fear should not be the failure

591
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,700
 of succeeding at things, our greatest fear should not

592
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,740
 be failure, but of succeeding at things in life

593
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,600
 that really don't matter.

594
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,760
 When I look around Dallas, the thing that I fear for most,

595
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,180
 the thing that, candidly, I fear for most of my life,

596
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,220
 or at the top of my list of the things that I fear

597
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,220
 about most, is spending my life focused on things

598
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,980
 that don't matter.

599
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,520
 Where I live, what house I drive, or what house I live in.

600
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,720
 Martha, stop opening that phone, Martha.

601
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,220
 The amount of money that I make, where my kids go to college

602
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,120
 and how many of us are gonna spend our life,

603
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,100
 and you're gonna be successful at everything

604
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,740
 except for what actually matters.

605
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,000
 What a tragedy.

606
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,580
 Am I saying that maybe some of you should change jobs?

607
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,420
 Yes.

608
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,620
 Am I saying that some of you need to get off dating apps

609
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,540
 because that's all you think about?

610
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,380
 Yes.

611
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,260
 Am I saying that some of you may need to stop

612
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,340
 your side hustle, your Etsy business, your side job,

613
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,180
 whatever it is, yes.

614
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,820
 If it is costing you on the things that matter most,

615
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,720
 so that you can focus your attention,

616
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,200
 and not get the most done, but focus on the things

617
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,000
 that matter most.

618
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,660
 The second principle that really we see from Martha,

619
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,380
 who is being drained, it says, 'cause she was distracted,

620
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,120
 pulled in all these different directions,

621
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,140
 is that she was anxious and overwhelmed.

622
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,960
 It says this, Jesus said in verse 41,

623
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,840
 "Martha, Martha, you are worried and upset

624
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,940
 "about many things."

625
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,100
 The same worried or upset, the same word there is troubled.

626
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,700
 The second way that really, like Martha, we can be drained

627
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,020
 is by being drained from distress,

628
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,220
 from carrying stresses and burdens

629
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,180
 that you were never meant to carry.

630
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,720
 All of us came into this room tonight

631
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,220
 carrying stress, things that are weighing you down.

632
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,340
 And the God who's there is saying,

633
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,380
 those things are gonna drain, just like an app,

634
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,900
 certain apps are gonna drain your battery

635
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,380
 more than other ones.

636
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,360
 Carrying those things is something

637
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,540
 you were never meant to carry,

638
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,740
 and they will drain the life out of you.

639
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,900
 And the God who's there doesn't want you to experience that.

640
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,740
 They will drain you to a point where it just feels like,

641
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,900
 I have no joy, I'm depressed, I don't even like where I am,

642
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,200
 I don't like who I am as a person.

643
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,700
 And the God who's there is inviting you,

644
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,260
 man, you're not meant to carry those things.

645
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,620
 For her, she was drained by all the stress

646
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,880
 of just stuff to get done.

647
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,340
 For us, I think it looks like getting anxious

648
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,940
 and distressed by a few things.

649
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,360
 Here's the three that I think of.

650
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,380
 One is comparison.

651
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,740
 Have you ever had that moment where you can feel anxiety

652
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,340
 over what you don't have but others do have,

653
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,700
 and you didn't even know that they had it

654
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,820
 until like five minutes, or until just like five seconds ago?

655
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,260
 You're like, oh, I pulled up on Instagram,

656
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,340
 they have this new car, I need a new car right now.

657
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,180
 And all of a sudden, I'm distressed and I'm anxious

658
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,740
 over the fact that they have this car,

659
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,780
 or they're always on vacation,

660
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,420
 I feel like I need a vacation.

661
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,340
 And I can, through comparison, about what others have,

662
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,000
 about what I don't, about how much he's making

663
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,640
 and where I should be in life right now,

664
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,780
 about how they have children and I should have those,

665
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,780
 or they're married already and I wish that I was,

666
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,500
 or they're in a dating relationship and I wish that I was,

667
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,100
 by comparison, all of a sudden, you can experience stress.

668
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,140
 The other way that we can experience,

669
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,940
 or you can be drained and take on burdens

670
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,980
 you weren't meant to carry is through sin.

671
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,820
 A lot of the most stressful situations

672
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,820
 that are weighing many of us down inside of the room

673
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,980
 is just related to sin.

674
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,960
 It's a stressful thing to hide pornography.

675
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,060
 It's a stressful thing to have an addiction,

676
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,960
 'cause you gotta feed that constantly.

677
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,580
 It's a stressful thing to have an STD.

678
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,380
 It's a stressful thing to live in a relationship

679
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,460
 or to be living with someone

680
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,020
 and you know they're not who God has for you.

681
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,700
 That is a stressful thing, and it kinda gnaws at you.

682
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:01,660
 And you're carrying a burden you were never meant to carry.

683
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,100
 And the third, really, arena of the burdens

684
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,980
 that we can feel in this life is just circumstances.

685
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,880
 And this is one that, if it's not affecting you right now,

686
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,300
 it's gonna affect all of us at some point,

687
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,560
 as long as, or if you live long enough.

688
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,340
 And that's just the fact of living in a broken world.

689
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,740
 Somebody's gonna get cancer.

690
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,560
 Somebody's marriages oftentimes don't always go,

691
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,960
 parents' marriages don't go the way

692
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,080
 that we hoped that they would.

693
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,040
 The company has a layoff and you lose your job,

694
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,680
 and you can feel burdened from carrying on

695
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,260
 just the circumstances and the stress

696
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,600
 that comes from living in a broken world.

697
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,440
 Here's the good news.

698
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,080
 Whatever burdens that you are carrying,

699
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,720
 they all have the same solution.

700
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,600
 Surrender those burdens to Jesus, to God.

701
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,600
 First Peter chapter five, verse eight says,

702
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,020
 "Cast all of your anxieties on him

703
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,080
 "because he cares for you."

704
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,120
 Cast all of your anxiety on him because he cares for you.

705
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,440
 I mean, how chill could Martha have been

706
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,680
 had she gone to Jesus and been like,

707
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,960
 "Hey, look, I'm a little worried about the food scenario.

708
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,500
 "You guys just showed up.

709
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,660
 "I don't wanna be that person,

710
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,200
 "but I got nothing in the pantry.

711
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,380
 "But I do know that, like, a week ago,

712
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,560
 "you took bread and fish and you fed 15,000 people,

713
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,700
 "so I'm pretty sure you can handle it."

714
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,480
 How different would her emotional experience have been,

715
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,780
 saying, like, "I'm not gonna carry this weight.

716
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,100
 "Jesus doesn't want me to carry this.

717
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,160
 "I'm just gonna bring it to him.

718
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,360
 "That's what he wants."

719
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,200
 Would've been a totally different story.

720
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,040
 Jesus doesn't need her to make him food

721
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,680
 any more than he needs you to reach that coworker.

722
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,300
 But Jesus says, "Man, will you cast all of your cares,

723
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,620
 "bring everything that's burdened."

724
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,760
 That's what I love the verse.

725
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,280
 It doesn't say, "Hey, cast all of your big worries on me.

726
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,560
 "Cast everything that's really big in your life on me."

727
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,940
 It says, "Cast all of the things that you care about

728
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,880
 "because I care about 'em, 'cause I care about you."

729
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,220
 Think about that.

730
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,120
 If you're inside of this room, you're like,

731
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,220
 "Man, I'm just worried.

732
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,440
 "I'm not sure that I'm gonna be able to,

733
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,160
 "I need to switch from an Android to an iPhone."

734
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,760
 God's like, "Hey, I care about that, 'cause you care about it.

735
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,440
 "I care about you."

736
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,480
 "Hey, I'm worried about, man, my dog is sick."

737
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,320
 Fill in the blank.

738
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,020
 Things that we don't even think, God, that he's up there,

739
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,460
 he's like holding the whole world together,

740
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,280
 and there's still starving children in Africa.

741
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,240
 I'm sure he doesn't care about that.

742
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,440
 He cares about it 'cause he cares about you.

743
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,280
 That's what the verse just said.

744
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,680
 Cast everything that you feel anxious about,

745
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,520
 bring it to God.

746
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,500
 Everything that weighs you down, pray to God.

747
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,120
 Everything that you're holding onto is a burden

748
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,360
 you were not meant to hold onto,

749
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,880
 and he says, "Will you bring those things to me?"

750
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,360
 The solution to every burden,

751
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,640
 all the things that are gonna drain you and weigh you down,

752
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,520
 is by surrendering those to him,

753
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,860
 bringing those to him through prayer,

754
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,200
 surrendering those to him.

755
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,120
 You know who the least stressful

756
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,220
 or stressed person in my life is?

757
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,860
 My three-year-old son.

758
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,740
 He's not worried about anything.

759
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,980
 We have to force him to take a nap.

760
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,640
 It's like, man, you don't know

761
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,160
 how much you're gonna want this someday, buddy.

762
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,000
 (congregation laughing)

763
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,280
 This is really unfortunate.

764
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,160
 I mean, he wakes up, he knows, like,

765
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,320
 hey, I'm gonna get provided for.

766
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,120
 They got apple juice in there, some applesauce.

767
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,960
 I mean, we're just, our cup overflows here.

768
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,480
 We got anything you need.

769
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,880
 The only thing he ever worries about is like,

770
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,600
 am I gonna get chocolate or not today?

771
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,020
 That's it.

772
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,800
 Last night, we went to the store to get M&Ms

773
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,760
 'cause we're out of M&Ms, and even then, it was like,

774
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,360
 all right, let's go to the store, get some M&Ms.

775
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,200
 Why is he not stressed about anything?

776
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,720
 He's not walking around being like,

777
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,680
 are we sure we're getting the best deal

778
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,640
 on this electric bill that we have over here?

779
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,040
 Do we know that, you know, TXU Energy,

780
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,040
 is that really best for us, or should we switch to Verizon?

781
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,320
 Is there something we should be doing different?

782
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,560
 How are we gonna pay for college, Dad?

783
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,280
 I've been really thinking about my portfolio.

784
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,780
 He's not stressed about any of that stuff.

785
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,880
 He's just like, man, my parents provide.

786
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,800
 Why does he think that way?

787
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,440
 'Cause he's around us all the time,

788
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,640
 and he sees that anytime he has a need,

789
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,400
 not necessarily a want, anytime there's a need

790
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,000
 that his parents provide for him.

791
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,800
 The Bible over and over and over again says

792
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,840
 that God wants you to see him as a heavenly father,

793
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,480
 that he wants you to come to him.

794
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,560
 He promises, I will provide for all of your needs,

795
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,880
 not necessarily all of your wants,

796
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,400
 but even bring all those anxieties,

797
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,720
 all the things that are weighing you down,

798
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,560
 and I want you to see me like a toddler sees his father.

799
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,880
 I'm a provider for you.

800
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,000
 I'm crazy about you.

801
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 Cast everything that you care about.

802
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Don't hold onto it.

803
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,600
 Give it to me.

804
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,560
 Bring it to me.

805
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,760
 It's too heavy for you to hold,

806
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,920
 and it will drain you as long as you're holding onto it.

807
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,960
 And the God who's there has cast everything

808
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,280
 that's weighing you down on me.

809
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,720
 I'm strong enough to hold it.

810
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,800
 The final solution that we see inside of the text,

811
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,560
 or the final thing that is not a drain,

812
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,600
 but it's really the positive example that we see from Mary,

813
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,880
 is that it is a devotion to Christ that brings life.

814
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,680
 And this feels like such a church Christian answer,

815
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,760
 like, yeah, of course, he's gonna say,

816
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,240
 devotion to Christ is what brings life.

817
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,080
 I get it, okay.

818
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,600
 Whatever you are facing right now,

819
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,720
 he don't wanna allow you to walk through

820
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,920
 the valley of the shadow of cancer,

821
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,280
 the valley of the shadow of job loss,

822
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,440
 the valley of the shadow of breakup.

823
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,960
 Whatever you're walking through will be a devotion to Jesus,

824
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,840
 that of everything in my life, he is my fixed focus,

825
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,040
 my first importance.

826
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,600
 I am committed to walking daily

827
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,840
 in a relationship with him like Mary.

828
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,160
 Look at the language that he's using.

829
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,920
 Look at the language that he's using, Mary.

830
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,960
 Look at the language Jesus says.

831
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,560
 Mary has chosen the better portion,

832
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,040
 the word better portion,

833
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,720
 it was essentially a food analogy.

834
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,960
 She has chosen the filet mignon,

835
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,680
 and I'm not taking it away from her.

836
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,760
 She has chosen the better thing.

837
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,240
 What is the better portion?

838
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,800
 Being with Jesus, knowing Jesus,

839
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,440
 sitting and learning from him,

840
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,200
 walking in a relationship with him.

841
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,640
 You wanna know what will allow you to sustain,

842
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,120
 to endure, to face whatever is ahead for you,

843
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,160
 and to walk in a relationship with him?

844
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,920
 It will be you walking in devotion to Christ.

845
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,560
 This is the only thing that continually gives life

846
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:50,320
 in a world that is broken,

847
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,560
 in a world that is fighting for your attention

848
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,960
 and fighting to drain you.

849
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,760
 As every day, so you've got it.

850
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,320
 First and foremost, you are my commitment,

851
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,480
 I am devoted to you,

852
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,560
 and I'm gonna walk in relationship with you.

853
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,280
 Think about what Martha missed out on

854
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,640
 when she was devoted first to Jesus,

855
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,360
 but devoted to her task list.

856
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,320
 Think about it.

857
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,400
 She has the son of God in her living room.

858
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,240
 Is there a more important person on the planet

859
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,000
 then and now?

860
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,480
 Is there a more important person in all of human history

861
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,600
 that has come over to her house?

862
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,760
 Think about the limited number of people

863
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,240
 who ever even met Jesus.

864
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,600
 How small was the number of people

865
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,560
 who had Jesus in their house?

866
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,440
 And what did Martha do?

867
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,280
 Did she spend time with him?

868
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,120
 No, she's like in the kitchen trying to sweep things up.

869
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,960
 Think about that.

870
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,240
 Think about what you're missing out on.

871
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,640
 You're afraid of missing out

872
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,240
 on all the different things that you need to get done.

873
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,120
 Martha, and the reality is you are missing out

874
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,880
 on the thing that is most important in life.

875
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,880
 So many of you are afraid.

876
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,320
 That's what drives us to fill our life

877
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,600
 with so many things that we need to get done

878
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,040
 and so many distractions all the time

879
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,360
 is you are afraid of missing out

880
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,560
 and you are missing out on the thing

881
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,880
 that matters most in life.

882
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,040
 And the choice like Martha had is yours.

883
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,240
 Am I gonna be devoted first to Jesus?

884
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,400
 Or am I gonna choose to miss out?

885
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,040
 I mean, think of, I don't know who your like favorite,

886
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,120
 most famous person you're like.

887
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,840
 If I could have anyone over to my house, it would be them.

888
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,680
 That would be amazing.

889
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,680
 Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa,

890
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,960
 Martin Luther, Moses, Cardi B.

891
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,160
 You do you, fill in the blank.

892
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,000
 Who would you be like?

893
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,320
 That'd be awesome if they came over to my house

894
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,320
 and got to hang out with them.

895
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,160
 Think about it.

896
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,980
 That person comes over to your house

897
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,120
 and you spend the whole time upstairs vacuuming and cleaning.

898
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,480
 That's what Martha's doing.

899
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,240
 That in her drive to get things done,

900
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,800
 she missed out on the Son of God and being in His presence.

901
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,200
 And she was devoted more to a task list

902
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,440
 than devoted to Jesus,

903
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,680
 devoted more to the things that she wanted to get done

904
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,520
 than to Him.

905
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,560
 In the same way, what is gonna fight for you

906
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,000
 every single day is for you to focus

907
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,080
 on things that are fleeting,

908
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,040
 on things that are meaningless,

909
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,880
 and you are gonna sacrifice your 20s.

910
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,480
 Some of you listening right now,

911
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,720
 some of you in this room right now,

912
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,520
 are you gonna give your 20s to things that are pointless,

913
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,720
 things that are meaningless,

914
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,240
 things that you won't even remember,

915
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,640
 not in 15 years, next week.

916
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,920
 Think about the last week that you had.

917
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,760
 Think about last week.

918
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,320
 Think about all the stuff that you got done.

919
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,280
 You can't even remember most of it.

920
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,860
 You're like, what did I do last week?

921
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,680
 It's hard to remember yesterday,

922
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,760
 especially when all of life is jam-packed

923
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
 with stuff that at the end of the day

924
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,160
 just really doesn't matter.

925
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,120
 And I have the choice, am I gonna fill my life

926
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,760
 with the things that have eternal significance

927
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,040
 or am I gonna give my 20s,

928
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,040
 which is one of the most significant decades that you have.

929
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,160
 Every major revolution in world history

930
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,120
 had at its epicenter the young adult,

931
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,000
 had people like you with passion and energy

932
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,060
 and youth on their side.

933
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,720
 There is no limit to what God can use you to do,

934
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,560
 and are you gonna decide,

935
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,080
 hey, I'm gonna give myself to the purpose I was created for,

936
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,740
 am I gonna give myself to just pursuing pleasure?

937
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:55,160
 And I'm gonna go to the bar scene and then the club scene,

938
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,800
 and you are wasting your 20s.

939
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,240
 And you may think, like, this is so fun.

940
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,920
 Think about how dull and monotonous the life that you live is.

941
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,720
 That's one of the things we talk about all the time.

942
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,640
 Sin robs you of creativity.

943
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,840
 You're not out living an adventurous life.

944
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,260
 You do the same thing every week.

945
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,100
 What are we gonna do?

946
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,520
 It's Thursday, we're gonna go to happy hour,

947
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,160
 and then we're gonna go to this next bar,

948
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,000
 we're gonna get buzzed.

949
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,920
 Hopefully we'll be not so drunk

950
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,200
 that I can't wake up Friday morning

951
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,480
 and be able to put it together at work.

952
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,360
 Then Friday night, I'm a weekend warrior,

953
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,160
 so I'm gonna, again, go out to the bar,

954
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,280
 I'm gonna get, I'm hoping I'm gonna find somebody

955
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,080
 I can hook up and go with home

956
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,120
 or bring them home to my house.

957
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,280
 And you're gonna do the same thing Saturday,

958
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,640
 and you hit repeat, you hit repeat, you hit repeat,

959
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,120
 and you are wasting your life.

960
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,960
 I wanna say that again.

961
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,280
 You're wasting your life, and you're missing out.

962
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,360
 You're missing out on the things

963
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,640
 that breathe peace into you.

964
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,200
 You're missing out on the purpose you were created for.

965
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
 Let me say it like this.

966
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,040
 This is a,

967
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,540
 this is a glove,

968
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,480
 in case you're not familiar with it.

969
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,280
 What is this glove made for?

970
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,960
 It's made to go in your hand.

971
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,200
 And it's made for cleaning, too, fair, touche.

972
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,600
 (congregation laughing)

973
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,880
 But it's made, like any glove,

974
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,920
 it's made to go inside of your hand.

975
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,160
 In other words, it's not made to go in your head,

976
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,120
 it's not made to go on your feet,

977
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,560
 not made to go on your toes,

978
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,680
 not made to, you know, just sit by itself.

979
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,880
 It's made for the purpose.

980
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,800
 Like, what was it created for?

981
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,640
 It was made to go in your hand.

982
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,040
 Well, how do you know?

983
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,940
 It's made in the image of a hand.

984
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:25,560
 This thing only fulfills its purpose

985
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,720
 when it's connected to the thing

986
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,280
 that it's made in the image of.

987
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,360
 When it's not connected to the thing

988
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,160
 that it's made in the image of,

989
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,080
 it fails to fulfill its purpose,

990
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,440
 it is empty, it is hollow.

991
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,200
 It may look pretty on the outside,

992
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,400
 it may be something that someone goes,

993
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,560
 oh, I know what that's for,

994
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,720
 but it is failing to fulfill its purpose.

995
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,200
 So are so many of you.

996
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,640
 Because unless you are connected

997
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,240
 to the thing that you are made in the image of,

998
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,360
 which is God, just like this thing,

999
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,640
 is made in the image of a hand,

1000
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,520
 that's how you know what it is for,

1001
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,840
 what it is to fulfill, what its purpose is.

1002
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,040
 So many of you are failing to live out

1003
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,880
 and experience your purpose

1004
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,320
 because you are failing to connect

1005
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,840
 and be connected to the thing that gives you purpose,

1006
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840
 the thing whose image you were made in.

1007
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,820
 And you have a choice.

1008
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,840
 How are you gonna spend your 20s?

1009
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,760
 How are you gonna spend your life?

1010
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,720
 Are you gonna wake up tomorrow

1011
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,280
 and just focus on the American dream

1012
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,920
 and the Dallas message of, like,

1013
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,000
 get more money wherever you live?

1014
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,880
 Move on to the next relationship,

1015
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,760
 try to find your value

1016
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,160
 and how many likes you get on a post

1017
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,560
 or what a guy says about you,

1018
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,640
 what some girl says about you,

1019
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,560
 or what amount you have in your bank account,

1020
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,120
 or you can experience your purpose,

1021
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,880
 but there's only one way to get it,

1022
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,600
 and that is to walk in connection

1023
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,680
 with the one whose image you were made in.

1024
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,320
 Mary knew that lesson.

1025
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,400
 Hopefully Martha learned it that day.

1026
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,080
 And the tragedy, and man, it, like, breaks my heart,

1027
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,200
 is so many of you, you're gonna give your life

1028
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,200
 to chasing more money for the rest of your life,

1029
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,320
 and hopefully I'll get some kids on a white picket fence,

1030
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,520
 and someday I'll be able to retire.

1031
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,680
 Someday I'll be able to, you know,

1032
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,320
 kick back and relax a little bit.

1033
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,600
 How crazy is that?

1034
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,900
 And you're gonna give the best years

1035
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,640
 or some of the best years that you have

1036
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,800
 to chasing what everyone else in the world around you

1037
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,960
 says you should chase after,

1038
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,400
 and not what Jesus says is where life is found,

1039
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,240
 what ultimately matters.

1040
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,140
 What a waste.

1041
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,100
 But it doesn't have to be.

1042
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,920
 In conclusion, the things that are gonna drain

1043
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,320
 and suck the life out of you

1044
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,340
 are being distracted by everything except for what matters,

1045
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,840
 being distressed and carrying burdens

1046
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,680
 that God who's crazy about you doesn't want you to carry,

1047
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,320
 and thinks he's gonna breathe life into you

1048
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,520
 is being devoted first and foremost to him.

1049
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,520
 I'm gonna walk in relationship with him.

1050
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,040
 If you have a phone, you can take it out

1051
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,440
 and you can turn it back on.

1052
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,480
 You know what you're gonna see when you turn it back on?

1053
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,940
 Whatever amount of battery life you had in there,

1054
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,400
 you still have.

1055
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,360
 If you had 50%, you got 50%.

1056
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,560
 It didn't drain anymore.

1057
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,320
 But you know what it didn't do?

1058
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,480
 It also didn't charge up to 100%.

1059
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,680
 Whatever you had is where you're still gonna have.

1060
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,760
 The only way for it to charge up fully

1061
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,040
 is for it to be connected to a source of energy,

1062
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,760
 of power, for you to plug it in.

1063
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,200
 Every second that it is away from that source of power,

1064
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,040
 in other words, every second that it's not connected,

1065
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,640
 plugged into the wall to a phone charger,

1066
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,340
 it's gonna just continue to drain.

1067
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:29,780
 This is how the Christian life is lived.

1068
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,240
 That you, unlike a phone,

1069
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,760
 are not meant to be charged once at night

1070
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,440
 and then go the rest of the day disconnected

1071
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,440
 from this source of energy which is Christ.

1072
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,020
 You are meant to be constantly connected.

1073
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,440
 And every second and every moment

1074
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
 that you're not living in dependence on him,

1075
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,800
 you will be drained and you will be draining.

1076
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,040
 Every second that I'm not walking in dependence

1077
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,440
 and continuing just Christ,

1078
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,280
 will you help me to be aware of you

1079
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,440
 in the midst of my circumstances?

1080
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,640
 Will you help me to have peace right now

1081
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,560
 no matter what I'm facing around me?

1082
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,920
 Will you give me courage to face

1083
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,020
 and share my faith with this friend?

1084
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,400
 Will you help me to see just your,

1085
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,240
 see the way that you see people?

1086
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,640
 It is when I live in a constant state of dependence

1087
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,920
 and walking with him that I experience

1088
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,160
 not being drained but being filled with life.

1089
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,240
 This is what this whole story is about.

1090
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,080
 I mean, let me say it again.

1091
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,240
 It's the same way that a phone needs to be connected

1092
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,160
 or else it will constantly drain.

1093
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,480
 As a follower of Jesus, you need to be connected with him

1094
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,720
 moment by moment, walking in relationship with him

1095
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,760
 or you will be drained

1096
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,460
 which is the point of this whole story.

1097
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,520
 Think about it.

1098
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,680
 The point of the story is not like

1099
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,100
 Jesus is against go-getters.

1100
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,140
 That's not what he says at all.

1101
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,100
 The point is that he wants a relationship with you

1102
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,280
 above everything else.

1103
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,760
 He wants you to know him and him to know you

1104
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,440
 beyond you serving him and doing things for him.

1105
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,280
 He wants a relationship, a constant connection with him.

1106
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,240
 He's not against go-getters.

1107
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,040
 Look at the Apostle Paul.

1108
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,640
 He's the greatest go-getter the world has ever seen.

1109
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,200
 He's against you serving him and not knowing him.

1110
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,240
 He's for you, walking in connection

1111
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,500
 and relationship with him.

1112
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,360
 And what will sustain and allow you

1113
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,880
 no matter what you face to not be drained

1114
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,040
 but be sustained is that, is walking in dependence on him.

1115
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,880
 Let me pray.

1116
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:37,140
 Father, would you help us to be still?

1117
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:42,000
 At a heart level, would we be still

1118
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,500
 and know and be convinced that you are God?

1119
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,680
 You will be exalted among the nations.

1120
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,360
 You are at work in the midst of whatever we're facing.

1121
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,520
 You are sovereign over our lives.

1122
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,920
 We can walk in dependence on you

1123
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,640
 and you've invited us into a relationship.

1124
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,920
 You've invited us to cast everything that's weighing us down.

1125
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,360
 Every fear, every hope, everything,

1126
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,960
 you've invited us to cast onto you.

1127
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,400
 And so I pray for friends in the room right now

1128
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,960
 that are walking through painful circumstances

1129
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,920
 in their own life and just surrounded by it

1130
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,100
 that they would cast everything on you

1131
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,460
 and you would sustain them.

1132
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,680
 Father, would you help us to be devoted

1133
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,580
 first and foremost to you, not distracted

1134
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,140
 from the things that pull our attention

1135
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,420
 in a world that is constantly bombarding us

1136
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,180
 with everything except what actually matters?

1137
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,260
 Would you unleash from this room

1138
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,740
 the greatest missionaries for your namesake

1139
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,740
 that have ever existed?

1140
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,620
 The greatest days of the church would be in front of us

1141
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,420
 because of the men and women inside of this room

1142
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,980
 who go on to do greater things

1143
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,500
 than the church has ever seen before

1144
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,040
 for your name and your sake, God.

1145
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,560
 And would you save us from living a life

1146
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,040
 that is devoted and successful even

1147
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,960
 at everything except for what actually matters in life?

1148
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,600
 Will you protect me, God?

1149
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,960
 Because my spirit is willing and flesh is pulled

1150
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,400
 at the distractions of the world around us.

1151
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,100
 And so would you help those who are weak like me

1152
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,400
 and all of us in this room

1153
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,480
 to be devoted first and foremost to you,

1154
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,320
 our Savior and our King, amen.
