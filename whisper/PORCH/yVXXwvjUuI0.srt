1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
 (phone ringing)

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,380
 - You have seven unheard messages.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,040
 - Hey, sorry I haven't texted.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,120
 I'm just not really sure what I'm feeling right now.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,580
 - Hey, yo Danny!

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,260
 Where you at, bro?

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,080
 I'll see you soon, all right?

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,200
 - Hey, so I have moved on,

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,560
 but I feel like the Lord keeps putting you back

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,800
 on my heart for a reason.

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,480
 So please call me back.

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,840
 - Hey, bro, hey, I know you're going through it right now,

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,140
 but listen, I found another girl at the farmer's market now.

14
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,600
 She's not a farmer, but she is on the market, okay?

15
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,040
 So hit me back, love you, bro.

16
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,800
 - No, I'm sure this is the right number,

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,760
 but last night was a mistake.

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,680
 I was just hoping we could keep that between us.

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,880
 - Hey, just wanted to say,

20
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,680
 I don't think I can make it tonight.

21
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,960
 Yeah, I've just been thinking about us a lot lately

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,440
 and we need to talk.

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,100
 (phone ringing)

24
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,760
 - All right, Porsche, how are we doing tonight?

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,780
 You doing okay?

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,120
 It's great to see you.

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,840
 If you've been here before, welcome back.

28
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,440
 And if you are new to the room,

29
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,700
 let me be hopefully not the first,

30
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,320
 but one among many who says we're so glad

31
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,360
 you're here with us.

32
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,500
 Everyone that is in Dallas, it's amazing to be with you,

33
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,880
 but it is also amazing to be with everybody

34
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,120
 that is tuning in online.

35
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,640
 We don't take it for granted

36
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,680
 that young adults all over the nation

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,640
 choose to give up part of their evening

38
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,800
 here with us on Tuesdays.

39
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,240
 And so thank you, all of you

40
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,160
 that are listening in on this series

41
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,600
 and what God is doing.

42
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,780
 We pray it is a blessing to you.

43
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,960
 And special shout out to all of our Porsche Live locations,

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,080
 particularly Porsche Live Dayton, Fort Worth, and Wheaton.

45
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,540
 So glad to be with you.

46
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,640
 We're talking about dating, people.

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,560
 And tonight is the third week.

48
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,520
 But before we get into it,

49
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,400
 let me lead off with a story

50
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,900
 that I think will set us up well.

51
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,840
 In my last job, when I lived in Houston,

52
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,800
 prior before I came here to Dallas,

53
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,080
 I worked in a young singles ministry.

54
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,760
 What I didn't know whenever I took the job

55
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,760
 is that I inherited a major crisis within the organization.

56
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,560
 It's not what you likely think.

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,280
 It wasn't that we had a declining attendance

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,520
 or a lack of giving from our members.

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,880
 It's not that I even had personnel issues

60
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,360
 or we were short-staffed in volunteers.

61
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,840
 We weren't even facing cultural challenges.

62
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
 No, no, no, it was something altogether different.

63
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,800
 You see, the major crisis that I inherited

64
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,940
 whenever I got to Dallas is that no one was dating,

65
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,960
 which is a big deal when you consider the fact

66
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,320
 that I was working in a young singles ministry.

67
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,920
 Like this is a place where people are walking with Jesus

68
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,200
 and they're trying to connect in the community

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,720
 and they're principally looking for a spouse.

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,560
 And so it begged the question in my mind,

71
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,920
 like why is it that all of you

72
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,400
 are in the picture-perfect place to find a romantic suitor

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,120
 and yet none of you seem to be doing that?

74
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,960
 What is the problem?

75
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,520
 Why is nobody dating?

76
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,160
 And so unable just to allow the question

77
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,600
 to be rhetorical in my mind, I started asking around.

78
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,120
 And what I found is that surprisingly,

79
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,640
 the answers were the same

80
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,280
 depending upon which group you visited with.

81
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,120
 And so I would ask the ladies, hey, why is nobody dating?

82
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,740
 And they would always respond with the same thing.

83
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,160
 They would always say, well, guys just aren't asking us out.

84
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,160
 It doesn't matter if I do my hair

85
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,880
 or if I get my Sunday best on

86
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,640
 or if I choose to share my Bible with him

87
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,160
 or I even visit with his friends

88
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,720
 and try to make nice with the boys

89
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,200
 or I stamp interested on my forehead.

90
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,600
 He just can't seem to catch the hint.

91
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
 To the guys, they would always respond,

92
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,740
 well, the girls never say yes.

93
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,000
 Doesn't matter if I confirm

94
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,160
 that she's single and ready to mingle.

95
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,920
 It doesn't even matter if I plan what I'm gonna say

96
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,760
 and where I'm gonna say it.

97
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,080
 If I talk to her friends and I make sure,

98
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,920
 hey, do y'all agree?

99
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,080
 Is this a good idea?

100
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,840
 Or if I actually go to the trouble

101
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,880
 of putting on my Sunday best

102
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,720
 and making sure my hygiene is in check,

103
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,920
 it doesn't seem to work.

104
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,280
 Anytime I ask a girl out, it is less remotely romantic.

105
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,920
 Instead, it is more like an extreme sport

106
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,200
 for my self-esteem.

107
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,480
 Both admitted to wanting the other,

108
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,800
 but both accused each other for why that wasn't happening,

109
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,480
 which felt crazy to me

110
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,120
 because they were all saying the same thing.

111
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,400
 I want you and yet it's your fault

112
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,240
 that we can't be together.

113
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,420
 That's what they were all communicating.

114
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,800
 It felt like a really bad soap opera in its 20th season

115
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,240
 in the sense that it just needed to end.

116
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,520
 Dating didn't need to be this hard.

117
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,960
 At least according to my estimation,

118
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,240
 it didn't feel like it needed to be.

119
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,440
 And yet, as I started preparing for this message

120
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,320
 and reading the research,

121
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,400
 what I learned is most people think it is.

122
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,940
 According to Pew Research,

123
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,400
 almost half of Americans say dating is harder today

124
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,200
 than it was 10 years ago,

125
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,800
 which I don't know about you,

126
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,920
 but when I hear something like that,

127
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,200
 it raises the question in my mind,

128
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,840
 what took place over the course of the last decade

129
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,200
 that has made the dating dynamic so much more difficult?

130
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,240
 Well, there's a lot that we could say on that,

131
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,840
 but when it comes to the realm of romance,

132
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,480
 there is one primary perpetrator that we need to identify,

133
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,720
 and it's this, technology.

134
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,920
 Whether it's the fear of being unintentionally catfish,

135
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,320
 and I mean that, like unintentionally,

136
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,400
 like you saw their profile on Hinge,

137
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,120
 and yet then they showed up in the date,

138
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,960
 and you're like, wait,

139
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,200
 that photo was like five to 10 years older than you.

140
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,760
 You don't look like that any longer,

141
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,400
 or it's the pain of trying to decipher,

142
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,960
 does he like me or doesn't he like me?

143
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,840
 He continues to like the things that I'm posting online.

144
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,440
 Or it's the trouble and the frustration of,

145
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,960
 man, my job requires me to travel,

146
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,800
 and so I work remotely, I'm on the road a lot,

147
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,840
 and yet as I do that,

148
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,440
 I feel disconnected from other people,

149
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,920
 particularly those that I might be romantically interested in.

150
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,280
 I don't know where it is,

151
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,680
 but what I need you to hear is the same technology

152
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,280
 that has infiltrated your regular life

153
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,640
 has infiltrated your romantic life,

154
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,240
 and the result is it has made your romantic life hard.

155
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,360
 You see, the dating dynamic today

156
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,000
 can feel like, for lack of a better word, discouraging.

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,960
 It is disheartening, no,

158
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,280
 to go into a series of first dates

159
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,000
 and feel like you give so much effort

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,360
 and yet walk away from all of them

161
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,720
 and feel like you got nothing out of them instead.

162
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,060
 It can be deeply confusing to process,

163
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,760
 how did she become so attached

164
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,680
 when we've only ever really had like one conversation

165
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,080
 with one another?

166
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,000
 It can also be equally infuriating

167
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,400
 to see that he's more invested

168
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,720
 in his intramural softball team than he is in you.

169
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,560
 I get it, but what you need to understand

170
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,980
 is we're all left asking the same question.

171
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,240
 Is dating supposed to be this hard?

172
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,560
 Is dating supposed to be this hard?

173
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,520
 That's where we're going tonight,

174
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,660
 because cards on the table,

175
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,240
 I don't think it has to be, nor should it be.

176
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,240
 You see, we often make dating so much harder than necessary,

177
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,960
 and the reason why

178
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,180
 is we just don't know what we're doing.

179
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,660
 Can we admit that to one another,

180
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,300
 that we might not actually be as familiar

181
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,740
 with the landscape of love as we claim to be?

182
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,880
 It's funny, I was preparing for this message

183
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,280
 and reading through some articles,

184
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,960
 and I came across one that was titled,

185
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,100
 "A Guy's Guide to Asking Girl Out."

186
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,480
 Now, normally that doesn't appeal to me

187
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,520
 as a credible source for a talk like this.

188
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,660
 And yet I was struck by two things I found very funny.

189
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,880
 Number one, the title insinuated to me

190
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,400
 that not only do men need instructions

191
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,200
 for building that desk at home,

192
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,320
 they need instructions for building a good opening line

193
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,480
 whenever it comes to engaging with the opposite sex.

194
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,880
 And the second thing that was very interesting to me

195
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,740
 is it claimed a 95% success rate.

196
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,440
 It said, "Hey, this thing is bulletproof, it will work."

197
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,240
 And so, like a moth to the flame,

198
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,540
 I pulled back the layers

199
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,120
 and I started reading through everything

200
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,480
 this author had said,

201
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,820
 and what I found was horrible dating advice.

202
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,400
 And I'm not claiming to be the expert here.

203
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,480
 I'm saying God is, and he disagrees.

204
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,560
 Because when you're reading headlines like,

205
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,160
 "Hey, keep her confused," or "Don't take no for an answer,"

206
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,720
 that's not good advice.

207
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,920
 (congregation laughing)

208
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
 And yet, what we can know from that

209
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,200
 is even the so-called dating experts

210
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,440
 don't have a clue what they're doing.

211
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,040
 No one knows what they're doing.

212
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,440
 But God does.

213
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,480
 And so over the course of tonight,

214
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,560
 what I wanna help you do

215
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,000
 is I wanna help you see what he says

216
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,840
 and the way that I wanna do it

217
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,160
 is I wanna give you a series of principles.

218
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,840
 I wanna help you understand the do's and the don'ts of it all

219
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,020
 but before we really get into it,

220
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,320
 what you need to hear from me is this warning.

221
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,560
 If all you hear tonight is a bunch of tips and tricks

222
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,640
 for finding that special someone

223
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,080
 or how to hack the system unhappily ever after,

224
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,400
 then you will have wasted your time here tonight.

225
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,640
 You see, values are only so good

226
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,480
 as the vision that they support.

227
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,860
 And so my goal is to help you get a vision of a God

228
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,680
 that has built a beauty beneath all of this

229
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,900
 that transcends things like a great opening line

230
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,240
 or meeting somebody new or going on that first date

231
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,920
 or publicly displaying your affection

232
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,640
 because people actually do enjoy doing that

233
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,240
 or meeting the parents at some point

234
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,440
 or bending the knee and proposing the question

235
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,080
 and sailing off into the sunset with your special someone.

236
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,360
 There's more to it than just those things.

237
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,720
 You see, Christ's principles for love,

238
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,280
 which we're gonna talk about tonight,

239
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,840
 they can get you a date,

240
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,160
 but it is Christ's picture of love

241
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,040
 that will keep you in a relationship.

242
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,600
 You need to see him.

243
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,180
 And so what I wanna do

244
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,660
 is I wanna walk you through a series of principles.

245
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,720
 I've got eight of them, which if you know me,

246
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,680
 immediately causes you to panic

247
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,320
 because I already take too long

248
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,160
 unpacking three to four principles every single week.

249
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,320
 So we're gonna split this thing into two weeks.

250
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,560
 We got part one tonight, part two next week.

251
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,060
 So if you like what you hear this evening,

252
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,360
 come back around because we'll have more for you next time.

253
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,960
 We're gonna walk through four principles

254
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,920
 on the dos and don'ts of dating.

255
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,240
 You guys ready for this?

256
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,240
 The first is this, don't be anxious, but do be dependent.

257
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,100
 Don't be anxious, but do be dependent.

258
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,940
 What do I mean by that?

259
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,780
 Well, to depend upon someone is to rely upon that person

260
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,820
 to fulfill some need that you have.

261
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,700
 Now, as I say that, this is not a license nor excuse

262
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,380
 for you to snap into your stage five clinginess

263
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,020
 and start searching across the four corners

264
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,100
 of this planet earth to find that person

265
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,380
 whom your soul has set its affections upon.

266
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,980
 That's not what I'm telling you to do.

267
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,980
 The goal here is not to be needy.

268
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,260
 You don't need a boyfriend or girlfriend.

269
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,180
 What you do need is you need Jesus.

270
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,980
 The scriptures unpack this very clearly.

271
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,540
 Isaiah 26, four says, "Trust in the Lord forever

272
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,560
 for the Lord God is an everlasting rock."

273
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,920
 Meaning that there is stability with him,

274
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,580
 that a relationship won't necessarily promise you stability

275
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,100
 but God can promise you stability.

276
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,900
 He is a rock upon which you can stand.

277
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,240
 Proverbs 3, five through six says,

278
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,460
 "Trust in the Lord with all your heart."

279
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,700
 Not just part of it, but the entirety of it.

280
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,380
 "And do not lean on your own understanding.

281
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,820
 In all your ways, acknowledge him

282
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,980
 and he will make straight your paths."

283
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,240
 Anybody feel like as you navigate

284
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,860
 the tumultuous road of romance,

285
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,380
 you often feel like, man, I am weaving

286
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,740
 and winding all over the place.

287
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,160
 God is the one as you walk through this life

288
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,020
 that can make your path straight.

289
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,340
 You don't have to bob and weave and wind and wander

290
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,300
 'cause he leads you forward.

291
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,720
 Romans 8, 28 says, "And we know that for those who love God,

292
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,720
 all things," that is a universal statement of totality.

293
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,740
 All things work together for good

294
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,660
 for those who are called according to his purposes.

295
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,040
 What's all that mean?

296
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,960
 In a world that's saying, hey, you gotta have sex,

297
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,720
 you need to find a partner,

298
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,400
 and you need to make sure to look for marriage,

299
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,960
 to have a fulfilling and complete human experience,

300
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,920
 you, if you have Jesus, can say, no, I'm good.

301
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,980
 I've got everything I need.

302
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,780
 I'm not one who is needy like the rest of the world

303
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,300
 that subscribes to your advice

304
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,340
 because I have all that I need in him.

305
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,220
 I have one who stabilizes me.

306
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,220
 I have one who leads me forward.

307
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,640
 I have one who works all things,

308
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,820
 even the bad of my life into good purpose.

309
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,580
 I have a God that I can depend on instead.

310
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,500
 My happiness does not rise or fall

311
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,940
 on the back of whether or not I find love in this life.

312
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,480
 My happiness rises and falls on the fact

313
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,120
 that love has already found me in this life.

314
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,660
 Jesus has found me, which is big when it comes to romance

315
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:40,440
 because few things are more anxiety-inducing than dating.

316
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,700
 I remember in that ministry that I was a part of

317
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,800
 that I described at the very beginning of the night,

318
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,400
 I could literally spot the guys,

319
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,120
 point them out in a crowd

320
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,440
 that were showing up to our Bible studies,

321
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,480
 not because they just wanted to open the leather

322
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,160
 and read together, they wanted to find a spouse.

323
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,000
 It was easy.

324
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,780
 I could point them out.

325
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,000
 Those guys that are, "Where's my hug at?" kind of guys.

326
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,060
 You know, I could find those dudes.

327
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,100
 They always had shirts whose sleeves were slightly too tight

328
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,120
 for their arms and their cologne wafted across the room.

329
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,680
 I could smell them before I ever saw them.

330
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,640
 I knew they, for some reason, would spontaneously appear

331
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,780
 wherever it was the girls were gathering.

332
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,840
 You could point them out a mile away.

333
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,480
 On the girl side of things,

334
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,560
 whenever a new girl would enter into the Bible study,

335
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,840
 you could see the death glare.

336
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,120
 Like every girl was out looking upon that new arrival

337
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,240
 as my new best friend.

338
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,120
 But you were the arch enemy that I have been waiting for.

339
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,840
 You were the one who is here to threaten

340
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,680
 all of my eternal happiness

341
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,640
 and the men whom I have come to find.

342
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,480
 That's what I would find.

343
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,320
 It was so easy.

344
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,440
 And the reason why all this is true

345
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,840
 is because dating is anxiety-inducing.

346
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,520
 Like it leaves people so pent up and worried.

347
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,840
 It spins them up and then it spirals them out

348
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,600
 with all sorts of emotion.

349
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,840
 It felt crazy to me.

350
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,360
 And yet the reality is, it is true,

351
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,360
 not just for me there, but for you in here.

352
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,960
 The data would say that 68% of women,

353
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,880
 68% of women, that's like seven out of 10 of you,

354
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,560
 would say that dating is your leading cause of stress.

355
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,920
 That's crazy.

356
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
 Like, have you seen the job market?

357
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,680
 Have you looked at the cost of living?

358
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,240
 Just look at the timeline on whatever social media you have.

359
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,680
 There is negative news everywhere.

360
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
 And yet you're like, I've seen it all,

361
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,320
 but it has nothing to do in comparison to my dating life.

362
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,280
 So much so that you're so stressed out

363
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,960
 that women even reported that some had passed out

364
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,720
 and puked on a date because of that stress.

365
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,120
 Guys, you're not necessarily losing your lunch

366
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,520
 the thought of dating, but you are losing your nerve

367
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,440
 because 63%, not seven out of 10, but six out of 10 men

368
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,240
 are just opting to stay single

369
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,760
 given the difficulties they find in the dating world.

370
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,600
 They're just like, I'm out, I'm out.

371
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,880
 Y'all can play with that.

372
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,920
 I'm gonna go over here and sit on the sideline.

373
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,520
 That's often the man's approach.

374
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,560
 What's that all mean?

375
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,760
 Seeking out love, searching for the one,

376
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,720
 sharing your feelings, risking rejection,

377
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,280
 and processing the possibility of forever

378
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,840
 with someone leaves people feeling anxious.

379
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,560
 And yet here's the thing for the believer,

380
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,400
 as we set sail and we voyage into the sea

381
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,960
 of swirling emotion and capsizing doubt

382
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,240
 that we call dating,

383
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,440
 we have a steady anchor.

384
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,320
 We have one who holds us fast

385
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,000
 because we don't depend upon our strength in the storm.

386
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,800
 We depend on his.

387
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,560
 We know one who calms the winds and the waves,

388
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,640
 even whenever the hurricane of romance blows through.

389
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,560
 We know God, and that changes everything.

390
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,200
 Paul says it like this when he writes

391
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,640
 to the church of Philippi.

392
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,960
 He says in Philippians 4, six through seven, famous verse,

393
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,640
 "Do not be anxious about anything,

394
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,680
 "but in everything by prayer and supplication

395
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,280
 "with thanksgiving," those are deeds of dependence.

396
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,120
 "Let your requests be made known to God

397
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,300
 "and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,

398
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,240
 "will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."

399
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,880
 You see, when you depend on God,

400
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,120
 you move from an obsession to that which isn't.

401
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,440
 I don't have a boyfriend, I don't have a girlfriend,

402
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,280
 I'm gonna be alone forever.

403
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,800
 All I'm gonna have around my house are cats.

404
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,680
 You move from an obsession with what isn't

405
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,040
 to a gratitude for what is,

406
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,740
 that I may not have a significant other,

407
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,880
 but I do have the significant one.

408
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,500
 I have God, and he is all I need.

409
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,160
 I need nothing else, for in him,

410
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,040
 I find all that I want and require.

411
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,460
 Now hear me, I'm not saying

412
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,860
 that you shouldn't desire a spouse,

413
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,660
 but what I am saying is that you don't need

414
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,780
 to be desperate for one.

415
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,860
 You see, desperate people do desperate things.

416
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,460
 I see this all the time.

417
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,740
 If you live within a ministry context long enough,

418
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,160
 you will see good godly people do crazy desperate things.

419
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
 The amount of godly women I know

420
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,920
 that have in a desperate attempt to find love,

421
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,760
 settled for some guy that goes to church,

422
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,920
 it is astronomical.

423
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,280
 I can't begin to count how many women I know

424
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,640
 that have actually found themselves doing it.

425
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,920
 I have talked to many of you down here

426
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,280
 at the foot of the stage,

427
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,900
 and here's what I wanna tell you,

428
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,160
 whether you're a guy in that situation,

429
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,440
 or you're a girl in that situation,

430
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,340
 if you are having to convince yourself they're Christian,

431
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,560
 they're not.

432
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,100
 They're not a believer.

433
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,240
 We know believers not just by their words,

434
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,200
 but by their deeds.

435
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,240
 We can look at their life,

436
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,480
 and we can see the one who is Lord over it.

437
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,120
 But Kylan, once we get married, I'm gonna help him out.

438
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,520
 No, you're not.

439
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,300
 He doesn't want your help.

440
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,640
 Like if he is not willing to love Jesus

441
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,600
 while he is trying to woo you,

442
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,220
 he will not love Jesus whenever he has won you.

443
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,880
 Right now he is in a season of impressing.

444
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,200
 And so if you're not impressed with what you see,

445
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,880
 then why would you wait any longer?

446
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,480
 You have my permission to break up.

447
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,360
 (congregation laughing)

448
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,420
 You want someone like what Jeremiah 17 describes.

449
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,200
 Jeremiah 17 says this, "Thus says the Lord,

450
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,640
 "'Cursed is the man who trusts in man

451
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,780
 "'and makes flesh his strength,

452
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,080
 "'whose heart turns away from the Lord.

453
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,980
 "'He is like a scrub, I mean shrub, in the desert,

454
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,520
 "'and he shall not see any good come.

455
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,720
 "'He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness

456
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,480
 "'in an uninhabited salt land.'"

457
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,400
 Let me just stop there.

458
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,120
 Does that sound like a guy you wanna pair up with?

459
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,280
 Like, did you hear the detail that Jeremiah just gave?

460
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,280
 He is like a shrub in the desert.

461
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,600
 He shall not see any good.

462
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,480
 He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness,

463
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,600
 in an uninhabited salt land.

464
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,200
 I don't even know what some of that means,

465
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,640
 but I know that I don't want that to be my story.

466
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,580
 But here's what you would want.

467
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,000
 Verse seven, "Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord,

468
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,700
 "whose trust is in the Lord.

469
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,860
 "He is like a tree planted by water

470
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,400
 "that sends out its roots by the stream,

471
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,600
 "and it does not fear when," not if,

472
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,440
 "but when the heat comes,

473
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,160
 "for its leaves remain green,

474
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,900
 "and it is not anxious in the year of drought,

475
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,800
 "for it does not cease to bear fruit."

476
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:34,200
 That's the kind of man you want, ladies.

477
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,320
 That's the kind of woman you want, guys.

478
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,400
 You want someone that trusts in Jesus,

479
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,000
 that depends on God,

480
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,480
 that does not look to you to be their source of life

481
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,480
 because they have a source of life,

482
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,440
 that is able to look at you when, not if,

483
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,400
 but when the heat comes, when conflict arises,

484
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,080
 when you're at each other's throats,

485
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,560
 whenever one of you loses a job,

486
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,920
 whenever someone gets sick,

487
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,640
 whenever a child goes astray,

488
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,720
 whenever the circumstances of life begin to suffer,

489
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,240
 you want someone that looks at you and says,

490
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,760
 "I'm not going anywhere."

491
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,580
 Why?

492
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,220
 "Because I am committed to him,

493
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,140
 "and because I am committed to him,

494
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,060
 "I am committed to you.

495
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,520
 "I'm not leaving.

496
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,320
 "I'm dependent, not on you for my need,

497
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,440
 "but on him who satisfies my every need."

498
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,980
 That's the first thing you have to know,

499
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,680
 because without that, every other point,

500
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,760
 we'll walk through this week, next week,

501
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,040
 it is irrelevant.

502
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,320
 You've gotta have that.

503
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,640
 Second point, don't be passive.

504
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,820
 Do be purposeful.

505
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:40,160
 Don't be passive, but you, you be purposeful.

506
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,800
 If you look at the landscape of dating today,

507
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,160
 a greater percentage of young men

508
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,040
 are single in comparison to women

509
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,000
 than at any other point in history.

510
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,960
 Why is that?

511
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,400
 The increasing prevalence of male passivity.

512
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,240
 Now, before you ladies break out and cheer,

513
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,620
 and you start to amen everything that I say,

514
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,180
 let me be very fair.

515
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,320
 I am not insinuating in any way

516
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,240
 that there is some deficiency within men today

517
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,680
 that there has not been in times past.

518
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,560
 This is the primary male problem.

519
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,800
 If you go back to the very beginning of the book,

520
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,400
 you know what Adam's original sin was?

521
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,480
 It was a sin of passivity.

522
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,960
 This is something that men, we, not you,

523
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,080
 we are all imbued with by nature.

524
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,720
 Our fallen nature says we are passive

525
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,120
 in our pursuit of anything,

526
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,160
 but particularly that which God has put us

527
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,240
 on this earth to do, to fulfill the cultural mandate.

528
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,440
 And yet what we know is that while passivity

529
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,360
 isn't particular to our generation alone,

530
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,020
 it is nonetheless our problem.

531
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,040
 We have to do something about it, men.

532
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,920
 And so let me talk to you for a minute.

533
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,640
 Sociologist and author Mark Regnerus,

534
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,800
 he describes in his book, "The Future of Christian Marriage,"

535
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,880
 that much of male passivity

536
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,280
 is the result of a culture accustomed to cheap sex.

537
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,400
 What he means by cheap sex

538
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,680
 is he talks about what he calls marriage economics,

539
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:05,760
 is that things like cohabitation

540
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,720
 and casual hookups and pornography make alternatives,

541
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,920
 which God would say are good and right and desirable.

542
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,920
 Things like abstinence and marriage, all the more costly.

543
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,020
 And yet what does it mean if something costs more?

544
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,160
 It is more valuable.

545
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,400
 It's worth more, as my friend in the front row said.

546
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,920
 You see, what you need to know

547
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,700
 is that you don't stumble over diamonds,

548
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:41,300
 but you do pass over pennies all the time.

549
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,400
 You see, it is easy to passively move through life

550
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,600
 and see pennies scattered along the way.

551
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,920
 And yet what do you do with them?

552
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,800
 Often you don't even bother to bend down and pick them up.

553
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,960
 Why? Because they are worthless.

554
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,040
 And yet how do you find a diamond?

555
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,640
 You purposefully pursue it.

556
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,680
 You must mine for it.

557
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,040
 It takes work.

558
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,240
 It takes effort.

559
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,680
 It takes initiation because it is valuable.

560
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,760
 That's how we should pursue romantic relationships.

561
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,280
 Men, very specifically,

562
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,400
 this is how you should pursue our ladies.

563
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,240
 You pursue them the way that Jesus has pursued you.

564
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,880
 First John 4:19 says, "We love because he first loved us."

565
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,700
 What is that saying?

566
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,280
 It's a very simple verse. We all know it.

567
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
 It's saying that Christ initiated with you

568
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,920
 before the thought ever even crossed your mind.

569
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,160
 Ephesians 1:4 says, "Even as he chose us in him

570
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,020
 "before the foundation of the world,

571
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,060
 "we should be holy and blameless before him."

572
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,300
 It's saying that Jesus chose you.

573
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,120
 Romans 5:8, "But God chose his love for us

574
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,080
 "in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

575
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,560
 "He was willing to not only seek you,

576
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,680
 "but sacrifice himself for you."

577
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,980
 This is the kind of purposeful love

578
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,600
 that we see in the person of Christ.

579
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,340
 You see, in God, we find anything but passive.

580
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,060
 He loved us before the thought ever even crossed our mind.

581
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,540
 He chose us before we ever thought,

582
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,620
 "Maybe I should choose you."

583
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,980
 He gave himself.

584
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,580
 He died your death because he wanted you that bad.

585
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,880
 There is not a happenstance moment

586
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,540
 or a haphazard bone in God's body.

587
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,900
 He is fully and finally intentional.

588
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,200
 You date the same way.

589
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,940
 You don't be passive, you be purposeful,

590
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,900
 which means for the men in the room,

591
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,300
 and don't worry, ladies, I'm coming to you next.

592
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,660
 You initiate in the dating context.

593
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,060
 You don't just slide into their DMs

594
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,600
 or connect with them online in some convenient way.

595
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,780
 And I'm not diminishing the opportunity

596
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,180
 that's available in online dating.

597
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,680
 That's another talk for another time.

598
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,380
 There's good and there's bad to that as well.

599
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,420
 But what you need to know is that those things

600
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,700
 require no purposefulness.

601
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,780
 It takes no courage to slide into someone's DMs,

602
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,660
 to drop a meme, to like a comment.

603
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,420
 It takes nothing of you to do that.

604
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,340
 And yet ladies, as you assess potential suitors,

605
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,260
 you need to see in them the kind of courage

606
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,000
 that you would wanna link up with.

607
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,500
 Guys, you need to make every effort

608
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,440
 to do more than swipe right.

609
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,060
 You need to walk across the room.

610
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,500
 You need to tell a woman she's great.

611
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,780
 And you need to ask her if she would be willing

612
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,220
 to go on a date with you.

613
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,540
 You be purposeful.

614
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,580
 And the thing is, you don't need to take my word for it.

615
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,940
 93% of women report that they prefer the man

616
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,780
 to make the first move.

617
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:38,300
 93%, that means nine times out of 10 in this room,

618
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,240
 if you catch yourself swapping glances with a young lady,

619
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,640
 more than likely she's waiting for you

620
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,160
 to do something about it.

621
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,380
 That's what this is saying.

622
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,740
 She is expecting you to move with confidence,

623
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,500
 dignify her as worth the risk,

624
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,380
 and demonstrate a kind of courage

625
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,840
 that Christ was willing to take on himself

626
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,460
 to save his beloved.

627
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,100
 But Kylan, what if I get rejected?

628
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,920
 You might.

629
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,820
 But godly men don't run from the fight.

630
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,980
 They don't run from the fight.

631
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,660
 We run into the fight.

632
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,140
 We engage the fray.

633
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,000
 I remember the very first girl

634
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,660
 that I ever asked out in college.

635
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,180
 I didn't know much, nor did I do much right at this point,

636
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:23,140
 but I remember by God's own clarion call,

637
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,880
 that she was worth me walking over and asking out.

638
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,380
 And so, wide-eyed and feeble freshman Kylan,

639
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:37,100
 made the long stroll across the cafeteria,

640
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,260
 and the whole way he went, he said, "She's worth it.

641
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,500
 She's worth it.

642
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,520
 She's worth it.

643
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,360
 She's worth it.

644
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,780
 She's crazy, but she's worth it."

645
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,460
 And as I stood there before her and all her friends

646
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,800
 not having chosen a good moment to do this,

647
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,680
 I asked her out and she said yes.

648
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,700
 Later on, she asked me why.

649
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,940
 And I told her, "Because I think you're worth it."

650
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:03,580
 Listen, if I can do that, we're not together, don't awe me.

651
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:09,100
 If I can do that, then you can do this.

652
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,620
 You can plan a date.

653
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,900
 You can send a text.

654
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,500
 You can write an encouraging note.

655
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,620
 You can send a voice message on your way home.

656
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,580
 You can make a reservation for dinner

657
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,480
 and you can tell her what to wear.

658
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,580
 All right, ladies, hold on, hold on, hold on.

659
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,820
 Ladies, ladies, like, yes, you are not off the hook

660
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,700
 because passivity is not just a guy problem.

661
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:38,440
 Listen, bye guys.

662
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,740
 That guy, that guy.

663
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:46,740
 Listen, ladies, passivity is not just a guy problem.

664
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,640
 You do not wait for a man to start living your life.

665
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,100
 So many women that I know,

666
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,460
 so many women I know that I've visited with,

667
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,260
 I've looked at them and I've asked them the question,

668
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,100
 "Hey, like, what's your plan, like next two, three years,

669
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,940
 like what's happening in your life?"

670
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,980
 And they have nothing figured out.

671
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,820
 And the reason why is because I'm gonna meet my husband

672
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,780
 and we're gonna get married

673
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,540
 and then we're gonna move in together

674
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,220
 and we're gonna begin to start our brand new life.

675
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,060
 And as I do so, he'll take care of the finances

676
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,900
 and he'll take out the trash

677
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,740
 and I'll never have to break down a box in my life

678
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,140
 'cause he's gonna do all of that for me instead.

679
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,580
 And yet what I want to look at them and say,

680
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,900
 as I have looked at them and said,

681
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,900
 and I want to say to you is fantasizing for your future

682
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,640
 is a form of passivity.

683
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,220
 So many of you are placing your life on hold.

684
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,900
 You are pausing your progress personally

685
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,500
 because the fantasy of what you want tomorrow

686
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,980
 is more riveting than the reality

687
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,020
 of what you have right now.

688
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,060
 Do not do that to yourself.

689
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:51,460
 Don't, not just because you deserve more, we need more.

690
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,620
 Like we need you, we need you to pursue your career

691
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,900
 and not wait to purchase that home

692
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,180
 and start leading in your church and serving other people

693
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,180
 and moving towards your gifts in God

694
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,140
 because that will lead to his glory and our good.

695
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,680
 We need you to do these things now, don't wait.

696
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,020
 Don't pause your progress personally.

697
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,560
 Do not indulge your passivity.

698
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,040
 Don't wait for a man to push forward in life.

699
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,380
 A lot is said to young women

700
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,580
 about becoming a Proverbs 31 woman.

701
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,940
 But you need to hear this

702
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,140
 'cause it says this of that woman in verses 16 through 17.

703
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,400
 She considers a field and she buys it,

704
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,380
 meaning she's entrepreneurial.

705
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:39,780
 With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard.

706
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,620
 She's industrious and she dresses herself with strength

707
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:47,080
 and she makes her arms strong because she's secure.

708
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,740
 She's secure, ladies.

709
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,140
 You be secure.

710
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,220
 You live purposefully with him

711
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,900
 and you live purposefully without him.

712
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,620
 When I lived in College Station,

713
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,180
 I had a dear friend that worked in advertising up

714
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,180
 in New York City and she left New York City

715
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,740
 advertising agency to come all the way down

716
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,260
 to small town USA Aggieland because God had called her,

717
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,280
 God had called her to specifically minister to women.

718
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,900
 And what we knew is it was a crazy decision for her to make

719
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,740
 because the rest of the world was looking,

720
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,560
 it was like, what are you doing?

721
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,780
 Like anybody that's, or everybody that's anybody

722
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,660
 lives in New York City.

723
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,980
 Like this is the place to meet someone

724
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,820
 if you're gonna meet someone.

725
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,580
 If you're gonna live it up, this is the place to live it up.

726
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,940
 Why would you leave here without a husband

727
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,780
 and move to that place of all places

728
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,560
 where the mean age is 18 to 22?

729
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,780
 Why would you do that to yourself?

730
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,380
 There are no romantic suitors in that city for you.

731
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,660
 And yet she said, I am driven by a purpose to my God,

732
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,860
 not to some man and so I will make the move.

733
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,900
 And she gave herself to the cause of Christ

734
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,700
 and she is making massive moves for the kingdom there.

735
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,180
 Ladies, you be like that.

736
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:57,660
 So say that all of this is making sense,

737
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,940
 but now you're wondering, how am I supposed to know

738
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,260
 or how are they supposed to know

739
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,980
 that I'm interested in them?

740
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,820
 Well, that's not a trick question,

741
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,840
 even though it can feel like, just go up and say hello.

742
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,900
 It's not a trick question because we live in a culture

743
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,860
 that has made communicating our intent

744
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,860
 increasingly difficult.

745
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,840
 It doesn't take long to just read across our society

746
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,600
 and see things like benching and breadcrumbing

747
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,180
 and cuffing and curving and wild flowering and zombieing,

748
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,080
 none of which I made up here on the spot,

749
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,020
 all of which I read in the research

750
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,640
 and are prevalent in your culture

751
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,540
 because people don't know how to communicate.

752
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,480
 What the heck is happening right here?

753
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,340
 Which brings us to our third point.

754
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,340
 Don't be confusing, but do be clear.

755
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:48,980
 Don't be confusing, but you be clear.

756
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,420
 Oh gosh, I gotta go quick.

757
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,180
 First Corinthians 14, 33a says,

758
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,180
 "For God is not a God of confusion, but he is one of peace."

759
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,500
 Psalm 119, 130 said,

760
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,540
 "The unfolding of your words gives light.

761
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,300
 It imparts understanding to the simple or the naive."

762
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,340
 If your dating is confusing, hear me on this.

763
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,500
 If your dating is confusing,

764
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,700
 then your dating is inconsistent with the character of God.

765
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,660
 God does not confuse his people.

766
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,500
 He gives clarity to his people.

767
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,460
 And we see that nowhere more exemplified

768
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,740
 than in the person of Jesus.

769
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,640
 If you read Mark 12, verse 14,

770
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,780
 you hear them describe this of our savior.

771
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,020
 It says, "And they came and they said to him,

772
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,820
 'Teacher, we know that you are true.

773
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,140
 You don't care about anyone's opinion.

774
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,420
 You're not swayed by appearances,

775
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,340
 but you truly teach the way of God.'"

776
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,180
 I love that.

777
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,260
 Like Jesus didn't change how he spoke

778
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,500
 or what he spoke to people,

779
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,940
 depending upon who it was that was standing in front of him.

780
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,540
 He did not change his opinion or truth based upon,

781
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,020
 or he did not change the truth

782
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,380
 on the basis of what people he was engaging with.

783
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,620
 Instead, he was always truthful.

784
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,460
 He was always honest.

785
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,700
 He was always understandable to those that he engaged with.

786
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,760
 And our dating should be the same.

787
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,420
 That's what people want.

788
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,700
 According to one of the largest surveys

789
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,500
 conducted on singles and dating in America

790
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,340
 from people just like you,

791
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,440
 the highest value in a potential partner

792
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,400
 is someone who is upfront about their relationship goals.

793
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,520
 Meaning we don't want to play games with each other.

794
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,220
 We want to speak plain to each other.

795
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,720
 We want to say what we mean,

796
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,900
 and we want to mean what we say.

797
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,900
 I remember when Brooke and I were dating

798
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,740
 early on in our relationship.

799
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,460
 We went on a date, amazing date,

800
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,700
 planned the entire thing out,

801
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,100
 had an incredible evening together,

802
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,540
 stimulating conversation.

803
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,300
 And I drove to drop her off at the Southern Dormitories

804
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,180
 at Texas A&M University.

805
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,080
 Do not whoop for the sake of our other friends in the room.

806
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,180
 Though I love you.

807
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:43,480
 And I leaned in, unplanned, and I kissed her goodnight.

808
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,540
 It did not take long, less than 24 hours,

809
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,740
 for her to call me and say,

810
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,660
 "We need to process some things."

811
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,740
 So we sat in my truck the next day,

812
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,100
 and she looked at me and she said,

813
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,020
 "I don't know what kind of girl you think I am,

814
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,760
 "but that's not the kind of girl that I actually am.

815
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,240
 "I am not okay with that line of engagement.

816
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,020
 "That's confusing to me.

817
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,100
 "What do you actually want this to be?"

818
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,380
 And it was there in the truck

819
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,020
 that I defined our relationship,

820
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,740
 because she called me to the carpet,

821
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,060
 and I loved her for it.

822
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,460
 Ladies, this isn't even in my notes,

823
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,180
 but I just need you to know for me,

824
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,980
 so much of the maturity of our men hinges upon

825
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,660
 your ability to look at them and say,

826
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,220
 "I'm not putting up with this."

827
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,580
 They will do as I did.

828
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,820
 They will lay restless at night in their bed,

829
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,740
 and they will wonder, "What has happened to me?"

830
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,000
 And you actually have the key

831
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,340
 to unlocking their growth in God.

832
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,460
 We must be clear with one another,

833
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,860
 which means we don't flirt with someone

834
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,580
 just to get a sense of validation.

835
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,580
 I talk to guys, and I've literally heard guys

836
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,060
 look at me and say, "But I love the thrill

837
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,060
 "of the hunt, Kylan."

838
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,100
 Do you know how weird that sounds?

839
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,100
 (audience laughing)

840
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,660
 Like, take the camouflage off, bro.

841
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,940
 Like, she's not a trophy for you to hunt and kill.

842
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,820
 She is a treasure for you to find and keep.

843
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,260
 Like, you're not gonna mount her on your wall.

844
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,780
 You're gonna move in together,

845
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,260
 and you're going to serve one another.

846
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,500
 That's the nature of how this goes.

847
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,860
 Ladies, stop hiding behind the excuse

848
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,500
 that you're just bubbly, and you can't help the fact

849
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,940
 that he's catching the wrong idea.

850
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,780
 Avoid emotionally charged friendships.

851
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,460
 Like, don't have full conversations through text

852
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,780
 or spend multiple hours a week with that girl or that guy

853
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,940
 who you have absolutely no legitimate interest in.

854
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,540
 Even if you love spending time with them,

855
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,420
 here's the thing.

856
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,960
 If you love spending time with them, then date them.

857
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,260
 But the reality is, many of you don't love

858
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,100
 spending time with them.

859
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,240
 You love that they're spending time with you.

860
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,020
 And that's very validating, and yet it's very confusing.

861
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,900
 Stop ghosting them.

862
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,780
 Do I actually need to unpack this one?

863
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,980
 Here's what I would say.

864
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,060
 If you're not interested, affirm them where you can

865
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,940
 and graciously tell them you just don't see it

866
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,840
 working out for yourself.

867
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,300
 I will literally tell you what to say.

868
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,140
 Are you listening?

869
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,960
 Here's what you can say.

870
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,420
 If you're not interested in someone, you can say,

871
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,160
 "Hey, I think you're great,

872
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,780
 "but I don't think we're a great fit.

873
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,860
 "Thank you for the honor of asking me out."

874
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,740
 That's it.

875
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,180
 It's that simple.

876
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:17,100
 It's dignifying to the other person, not demeaning to them.

877
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,840
 You actually treat them like they exist,

878
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,520
 that they're a child of God,

879
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,900
 that they're your brother or sister in Christ.

880
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,500
 You don't ghost them.

881
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,220
 Avoid using some derivative of, "It's not you, it's me."

882
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,780
 No, it is them.

883
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,940
 So tell them that.

884
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,060
 (congregation laughing)

885
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,220
 Saying things like, "I'll always love you.

886
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,060
 "You're so great.

887
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,940
 "Maybe one day the timing's just bad."

888
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,340
 That is not helping them.

889
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,160
 Listen to me.

890
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,600
 Clarity brings closure,

891
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,460
 and it's kindness to help people close the chapter

892
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,740
 on one stage of life

893
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,220
 so they might begin to write a new chapter with someone else.

894
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,840
 You do that for them.

895
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,820
 I'm not saying you cut them down to the knees.

896
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,160
 "Well, I hate you because you smell bad,

897
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,000
 "and your hair's weird,

898
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,980
 "and you have a weird taste in food or music."

899
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,560
 Don't do that.

900
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,820
 Be clear with them.

901
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,640
 Gracious, but truthful.

902
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,620
 And then definitely, last but not least,

903
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,540
 quit using God as your excuse.

904
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:14,500
 (congregation cheering)

905
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,900
 It is insincere

906
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,680
 to say

907
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:26,920
 that God is calling you someplace else,

908
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,240
 that you just don't have peace about this,

909
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,560
 that you're still processing with your community

910
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,940
 when in reality, you just don't like them.

911
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,820
 Listen to me.

912
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,140
 I'm not trying to be funny.

913
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,560
 I'm really wanting to engage with you

914
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,160
 because this sounds nice,

915
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,440
 but what it does is it excuses you from the responsibility,

916
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,460
 and it accuses God of being at fault.

917
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,740
 Do not do that.

918
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,280
 Do not call his character into question

919
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,120
 in the life of another believer

920
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,880
 because you're not interested.

921
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,240
 That is a disproportionate allocation of value.

922
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,480
 It's okay to say, "I don't see this working,"

923
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,640
 but don't tell them God doesn't see it working.

924
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,880
 Proverbs 24, 26 says,

925
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,460
 "An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.

926
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,000
 "Clarity is kindness, so be clear with one another."

927
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,480
 And lastly for tonight, don't be dramatic.

928
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,600
 Do be steady.

929
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,960
 You be steady.

930
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,140
 Second Corinthians 10, five says,

931
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,200
 "We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion

932
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,720
 "raised against the knowledge of God,

933
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,440
 "and we take every thought captive to obey Christ."

934
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,540
 Isaiah 26, three says,

935
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,920
 "You keep him in perfect peace,

936
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,480
 "whose mind is stayed on you because he trusts in you."

937
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,320
 Philippians 4, eight says,

938
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,900
 "Finally, brothers and sisters,

939
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,660
 "whatever is true and honorable and just

940
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,420
 "and pure and lovely and commendable,

941
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,560
 "if there's any excellence,

942
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,020
 "if there's anything worthy of praise,

943
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,400
 "then think about these things."

944
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,120
 You hear what these verses are emphasizing?

945
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,360
 They are all emphasizing your thought life,

946
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,640
 that we should take thoughts captive to obey Christ,

947
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,120
 that we should keep our minds stayed on God,

948
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,400
 that we should think about godly things.

949
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,360
 Why does that matter?

950
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,120
 Because you want to date someone that's in their right mind.

951
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,320
 I remember a mentor of mine,

952
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,480
 he called me and he asked me,

953
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,800
 "Hey, how are you and Brooke doing?"

954
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,320
 And I responded, "Man, we're doing really great.

955
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,660
 "Like nothing really new to report."

956
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,660
 And I loved his response.

957
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,560
 He sighed on the other end of the phone and he said,

958
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,260
 "Man, isn't that awesome?"

959
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:26,020
 Steadiness is not listed amongst the most sexy qualities

960
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,420
 to find in a suitor,

961
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,260
 but it is listed among the best qualities

962
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,900
 to find in a suitor.

963
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,540
 You want someone that is like their God,

964
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,180
 the same today, yesterday, and forever.

965
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,320
 You want them to be consistent.

966
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,500
 You don't want to date crazy.

967
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,460
 You don't want someone that's lost in their feelings.

968
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,380
 You want someone that's tethered to the truth,

969
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,300
 that tunes their life to the voice of God.

970
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,740
 But Kylan, what about following your heart?

971
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,300
 That is terrible advice.

972
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,140
 Do not follow your heart.

973
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,900
 Follow God's word.

974
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,940
 Like the scriptures tell us in Proverbs 28, 26,

975
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,420
 as one example,

976
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,520
 he who trusts in his own heart is a fool,

977
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,680
 but he who walks wisely will be delivered.

978
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,300
 How do you walk wisely

979
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,340
 with the one that has written wisdom

980
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,620
 into the fabric of creation?

981
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,980
 You see, the heart wants for things that it should not,

982
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,000
 and it leads us to do things we regret.

983
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,360
 So we don't follow our feelings.

984
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,600
 We focus on the truth.

985
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,440
 That's who we are.

986
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,720
 We are a people of the truth.

987
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,580
 We follow it and it alone.

988
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,020
 You see, what you have to know

989
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,340
 is whatever is consistently true

990
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,540
 in your significant other's life

991
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,300
 is going to eventually become consistently true

992
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,900
 in your own life.

993
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,100
 Because as you date and you come together,

994
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,580
 one another, standing in the altar,

995
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,420
 because that's the point and purpose of dating,

996
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,260
 it's to eventually have a series of yeses

997
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,740
 that leads to an eventual I do,

998
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,060
 what you will find is that what's true of them

999
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,380
 will become true of you.

1000
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,020
 You will become like one another,

1001
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,460
 or you'll just see that this isn't working,

1002
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,660
 and you'll go against God's will and you'll divorce.

1003
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,220
 This is how these things happen.

1004
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,740
 You want someone that is not drama.

1005
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,580
 Well, he's always angry.

1006
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,920
 He can't seem to regulate his emotions.

1007
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,580
 Well, she always knows what's going on with her friends

1008
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,560
 or with her friends or our neighbors' lives.

1009
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,500
 Do you think you want someone to know the details

1010
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,340
 of everybody's life as well as the details of yours?

1011
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,180
 It sounds like they're not good

1012
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,860
 at probably keeping that information locked.

1013
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,780
 Well, she likes bad boys.

1014
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,740
 That sounds like sabotage to your peace.

1015
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,020
 You know, I would avoid that at all costs.

1016
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,300
 Like you don't want someone that's full of drama.

1017
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,540
 You want someone that's steady.

1018
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:28,760
 In the book of Judges, we meet a guy by the name of Samson.

1019
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,820
 Samson is head over heels in love

1020
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,140
 with this woman named Delilah.

1021
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,700
 She was a Philistine woman.

1022
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,200
 And what you see is there are two things

1023
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,980
 characterized in her relationship with Samson.

1024
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:42,100
 She is characterized by a desire for him,

1025
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,860
 but also a deceit of him.

1026
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,660
 You see, she wanted to betray Samson

1027
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,820
 into the hands of her people so they might overcome him.

1028
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,260
 And so the entirety of their relationship,

1029
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,460
 she is trying to figure out what his weakness is.

1030
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,420
 You want to know what Samson's weakness was?

1031
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,780
 It wasn't his hair.

1032
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,700
 It's that he fell in love with crazy.

1033
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,580
 That's Samson's problem.

1034
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,420
 He started dating drama.

1035
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,700
 Do not make the same mistake.

1036
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,820
 You date to find a spouse.

1037
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,220
 You went to find someone that you can link up with

1038
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,140
 and you can move forward through life together alongside.

1039
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:21,500
 Will you know if they're the one on the first date?

1040
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,780
 No.

1041
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,580
 Will you know if they're the one in the first month?

1042
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,500
 Likely no.

1043
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,140
 So many of us have bought into this formulaic

1044
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,220
 Christian science where we must tell her

1045
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,060
 that I am only pursuing her for the sake of being united

1046
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,300
 to one another in holy matrimony under God

1047
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,540
 and before all of our friends.

1048
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,320
 And then I must make all of my intentions

1049
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,580
 plainly clear before.

1050
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,260
 We're so bought into this science.

1051
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,460
 Listen, dating is not a science, it is an art.

1052
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,860
 But there are a series of colors you should paint with.

1053
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,440
 We have given you four tonight.

1054
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,880
 We're gonna give you four more next week.

1055
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,040
 You paint with them a beautiful picture

1056
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,340
 that matches the picture of Christ's love for us.

1057
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,700
 How has Christ loved us?

1058
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,020
 He's done all of this.

1059
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,220
 When we were anxious in spirit,

1060
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,780
 he was dependent on our behalf.

1061
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,260
 He submitted himself to the will of God.

1062
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,140
 He left heaven, he came to earth because God wanted him to.

1063
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,260
 What we see in Christ is that when we were passive,

1064
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,540
 he was still purposeful.

1065
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,500
 He pursued a people, catch this,

1066
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,820
 that wanted nothing to do with him.

1067
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,380
 He didn't fear rejection.

1068
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,380
 He looked at us and he said,

1069
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,900
 "You can tell me no and no and no."

1070
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,540
 Again, some of you have been telling him no and no

1071
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,140
 and no all your life.

1072
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,220
 And yet he is here tonight pursuing you.

1073
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,620
 And he's saying, "Please finally say yes to me.

1074
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,660
 "I am purposeful for you.

1075
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,900
 "I will pursue you because you're valuable to me.

1076
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,700
 "You're not some penny that I'm gonna leave

1077
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,140
 "laying upon the ground.

1078
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,040
 "No, I want to scoop you up.

1079
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,820
 "I want to mine you out.

1080
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,300
 "I want to bring you to myself."

1081
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,540
 You see, when we were confused,

1082
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,660
 what we see is that Jesus was clear.

1083
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,240
 Like he brought clarity to the confusion of our condition.

1084
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,900
 We, like she had gone astray.

1085
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,660
 We didn't know what we were doing.

1086
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,540
 We were lost in our rebellion

1087
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:08,380
 and yet Christ full of crystal clarity saw

1088
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,860
 that is their condition.

1089
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,220
 This is the cost.

1090
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,640
 And what I will do is I will give myself to pay it.

1091
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,300
 And what we know is that Jesus,

1092
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:23,300
 he, while we were lost in the drama of our death,

1093
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,020
 he was steady for our sake.

1094
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,800
 Jesus was one who never wavered for you,

1095
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,120
 never second guessed about you.

1096
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,720
 He always kept the right mind that he wanted you

1097
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,320
 even to the point when he should have questioned it himself,

1098
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,120
 hanging upon the cross and dying your death for you.

1099
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,080
 This is the kind of love that Christ has for you.

1100
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,160
 Listen to me.

1101
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,300
 If you wanna build a relationship that lasts,

1102
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,200
 then look to the one that has built a relationship

1103
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,040
 that does last.

1104
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,100
 He has built a relationship with you

1105
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,280
 that will not just last today or tomorrow or this life.

1106
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,480
 It lasts forever.

1107
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,920
 So many of us are trying to do this on our own.

1108
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,800
 We're looking to the world for advice.

1109
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,840
 No, stop looking elsewhere.

1110
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,360
 Look right here.

1111
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,940
 He wants to tell you how to do it

1112
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,280
 because he has shown you how to do it.

1113
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,880
 He has shown you by way of his own sacrifice.

1114
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,320
 Let me pray that you would believe it.

1115
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,360
 God, we are so grateful for tonight.

1116
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:32,920
 God, I am personally overwhelmed

1117
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,020
 at the thought of how much you love us,

1118
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:41,340
 what you would give to have us.

1119
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:46,080
 I pray, Lord, please,

1120
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,180
 as has been my prayer,

1121
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,400
 let us not just see hints and hacks

1122
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,680
 for how to date well and find love and get married.

1123
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,480
 God, no, help us to see the beauty beneath it all.

1124
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,300
 That beauty which would say,

1125
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:10,040
 I'll give up everything to have you.

1126
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,560
 I love you so much.

1127
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,200
 How much, Jesus?

1128
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,760
 I love you so much that I'll give my life for you.

1129
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,240
 But I don't deserve that.

1130
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,340
 You don't deserve it.

1131
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,500
 I'm not worth that.

1132
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,660
 You're not worthy of it.

1133
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,860
 But I love you anyways.

1134
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:28,260
 I choose you anyways.

1135
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,100
 That's how great the love of God is for us.

1136
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,300
 And so, God, it's to that love that we respond tonight.

1137
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,140
 We're grateful.

1138
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,140
 Let us, God, now hold nothing back

1139
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,440
 for nothing held you back in pursuit of us.

1140
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,620
 It's in your name we pray, amen.

1141
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:53,620
