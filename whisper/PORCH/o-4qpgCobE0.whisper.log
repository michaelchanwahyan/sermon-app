[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:19.120]   Come on, Fortch, how we doing?
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.560]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.080]   Come on.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.720]   Come on, come on.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.120]   Tonight, yes, tonight we are talking,
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.760]   I'm talking to the men.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.360]   Hey ladies, you can leave.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.560]   No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.200]   Hey, are there any dudes here anyways?
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.040]   Do you guys show up?
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.740]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.640]   I love it, I love it, I love it.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.040]   Well, I wanna say hi to our campuses,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.880]   El Paso and Fort Worth and Houston and Tulsa
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.320]   and wherever you're at around the world,
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.280]   if you're listening, welcome to the porch.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.580]   We're glad you're here.
[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.120]   We're talking to the men, what to look for in a woman.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.020]   And so to find out what you guys are thinking,
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.020]   we went to the State Fair of Texas here in Dallas
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.560]   and we were asking some guys.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.000]   And so we caught some video.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.060]   Why don't we start just by watching this?
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.440]   Hey guys, Josh and Elaine out here at the State Fair
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.600]   and we're here trying to figure out how people navigate
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.740]   life, love, relationships.
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.840]   Dating, their dream guy, their dream girl,
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.780]   do you believe in the one, soulmate, all that stuff.
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.620]   Yeah, come along with the ride, let's figure it out.
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.480]   Describe to me your dream girl.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.620]   You know, she gotta like be into the same stuff
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.980]   that I can be into, 'cause like if we ain't into the same stuff
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.120]   we're not gonna click.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.460]   Probably have to be like a Mexican, nice body, tan.
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.400]   She got a nice smile, some cute eyes.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.060]   You know, the body doesn't have to be perfect,
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.000]   but you know, a little, a little curviness.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.100]   Funny I guess.
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.340]   Yeah, what do you think?
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.440]   Yeah, someone who's quirky like me, I don't know.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.840]   Just instant connection I guess.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.980]   Like he said, beautiful smile,
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.640]   that's like the first thing, smile.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.020]   If she has a good personality,
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.620]   I never really was big on the body, so like.
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.860]   (laughing)
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.360]   All right, all right, all right.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.440]   So that's what we're thinking.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.000]   So my family and I, we went to the state fair as well,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.540]   and a very different experience, right,
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.840]   when you got three kids with you,
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.380]   and so you know, we're riding the ladybugs and stuff.
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.140]   And we go through this like, that warehouse thing
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.880]   where they, it's not the car show,
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.220]   but that area by Big Tex, if you've been there,
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.680]   you've been to Dallas.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.420]   And in there they like sell hot tubs and mattresses.
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.660]   You guys been in there?
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.960]   You probably don't even go in there,
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.620]   but we go in there 'cause we're those people.
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.660]   And we're walking through,
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.400]   and there's this guy selling a Vitamix, a blender.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.600]   Like and so we, our family, we get sucked into this guy.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.740]   He's got the microphone on, and he's just making the sale,
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.800]   talking about how amazing this blender is.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.740]   And so I don't know if you have blenders
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.240]   where you're into like juicing celery or something,
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.620]   but this dude's just getting after it.
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.020]   And it's an amazing blender, right?
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.160]   Like it weighs the stuff that you put inside.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.520]   It tells you the recipe, and then it tells you
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.420]   if you're putting enough of it in there.
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.860]   And he's mixing it all up, and he's pulling some spinach,
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.020]   and some kale, and some grapes.
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.060]   I'm like, man, I don't want anything to do with that.
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.000]   But as he adds, he adds some like ice and water,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.240]   and it keeps telling you it will be green
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.440]   until you put just, or actually it's red, I'm sorry,
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.440]   it'll be red until you put just enough in,
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.880]   and then it turns green, and it says,
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.580]   okay, switch to the next ingredient.
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.880]   And he's just mixing it up.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.040]   And as I was thinking about that with my family,
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.180]   as this guy's adding stuff in there,
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.820]   this is what I think guys do when it comes
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.220]   to trying to find the perfect woman.
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.460]   You know, they want these different ingredients, okay?
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.200]   Like I want her to be really fun, okay?
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.000]   But not too much drama, okay?
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.160]   I want her to love football, but not too much football,
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.940]   like not more than me, 'cause that's weird.
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.780]   And I want her to be like really hot, you know,
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.440]   add the cayenne or whatever.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.180]   I want her, she needs to look like Gigi Hadid
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.620]   or Megan Fox, but also serve like Mother Teresa, okay?
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.480]   But, and so I want her to love to work out,
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.820]   because I like to look at people who love to work out,
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.400]   and so you're kind of throwing that stuff in there, right?
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.100]   This is what you're thinking,
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.500]   and you're trying to mix up the perfect woman.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   And it leaves you looking, and wanting, and searching.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.780]   Because if I'm honest, as I've met with guys
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.780]   over the past decade, here's what I,
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.620]   here's been my big takeaway
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.520]   of what you guys are looking for.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.120]   You don't know what you're looking for.
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.420]   You don't really know what you're looking for.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.220]   You're thinking, oh, you know, I'll just,
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.860]   when I find it, I'll have this feeling,
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.760]   this emotional response.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.940]   That's what's going on, like it'll be perfect,
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.860]   it'll be just the right mix of everything,
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.660]   so I have a little bit of this, a little bit of that,
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.700]   and everything is gonna blend together perfectly,
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.900]   throw me into her life,
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.940]   and we're gonna mix together perfectly.
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.580]   And that's just not how it works.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.780]   And what it does is I see guys get into relationships,
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.480]   and everything seems right,
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.080]   but then anxiety kicks in, fear kicks in,
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.640]   cold feet kicks in, all of these questions
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.020]   begin to consume them, they go,
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.860]   well, I don't know if she's the one,
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.240]   or if we're gonna make it work,
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.400]   or if I should take that, you know, go further,
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.440]   take that step.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.800]   And what if?
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.040]   What if I could help you tonight?
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.140]   What if I could give you from the scriptures,
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.520]   the things to look for in a woman,
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.440]   just to keep it really simple,
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.920]   hey, here's some things that you can look for in a woman.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.660]   So this evening, we're talking about the fantasy girl,
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.420]   as we move through this series called Fantasy,
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.880]   Finding Real Love in a Fake World.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.140]   And the reason we say finding real love in a fake world
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.720]   is because that's the big felt need
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.240]   that everybody came in here with,
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.080]   everybody's listening with, you want to be loved,
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.420]   you want to experience love, you want to give love.
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.220]   But the problem is, is the world says,
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.760]   hey, this is how you do that,
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.920]   they have no idea what they're talking about.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.760]   They're awful at it.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.100]   They're really, really, really bad at it,
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.440]   and yet they're your teachers.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.560]   Be it social media, be it Tinder, be it movies,
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.880]   be it TV shows, be it airbrushed magazines, it's fake.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.900]   And it leaves you not knowing what you're looking for.
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.740]   And you end up thinking about a wife like she's a smoothie,
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.880]   with all the perfect ingredients in there.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.880]   And you don't even know what ingredients you're looking for.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.280]   I'll say it in a different way,
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.780]   kind of throwback to last week,
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.200]   you're looking for the wrong ingredients.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.780]   And so what can we do about it?
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.780]   I want you to know I understand, like I empathize with you.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.680]   When I was looking for a wife, I mean,
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.120]   here's the truth about where I was at,
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.480]   wasn't in a relationship with Jesus.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:20.400]   I was entrenched into an addiction to pornography and sex.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.620]   I loved going to the strip clubs.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.540]   So what did I want in a wife?
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.380]   I wanted someone who looked like a porn star,
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.500]   who I could tolerate.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.120]   Like, honestly, like I could just put up with her.
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.220]   And I think the reason I say that is,
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.900]   I think that's a lot of you,
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.460]   men, you came in here,
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.240]   you've been brainwashed by the same teacher I was.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.380]   And you may not say it like I did,
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.380]   but subconsciously, that's what you want.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.180]   You want someone who's hot by your standards
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.580]   and that you can tolerate.
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.580]   And that's gonna lead to tragedy, disaster,
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.400]   despair, divorce, and a lot of hurt.
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.580]   And it may just leave you,
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.960]   you might just keep looking and looking
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.420]   and looking and looking.
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.860]   I want you to know, men, marriage is a good thing.
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.940]   Proverbs 18, verse 22 says,
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.980]   "He who finds a wife finds what is good
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.660]   "and receives favor from the Lord."
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.060]   And so if you are here or you are listening
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.500]   and you are well and you want a wife, find one.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.340]   Like, find one, I wanna help you.
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.780]   Like, we could do this before you go home tonight.
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:41.580]   Like, I'm telling you, we can make it super simple.
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.980]   All right, we'll just do some arranged marriages,
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.440]   mix it up, it's gonna be awesome.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.100]   But you gotta start by knowing what you're looking for.
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.620]   And so I think the scripture's gonna do this.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.100]   So we're talking about the fantasy girl
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.860]   and it's interesting because there's a scripture,
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.900]   an entire chapter of the Bible
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.540]   dedicated to the fantasy girl,
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.020]   or the gold standard, if you will.
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.820]   Do you know what it was, what it is?
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.420]   Proverbs 31, Proverbs 31, woman.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.500]   I probably referenced Proverbs 31 50 times
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.640]   in the past 10 years, and I've never taught this text
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.180]   in the way that we're going to do it tonight,
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.100]   verse by verse, looking at it.
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.740]   And it's really an interesting text
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.220]   because you know who wrote it?
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.060]   So it says King Lemuel.
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.420]   King Lemuel, there's some debate around this,
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.500]   but leading scholarship believes
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.740]   that there was no King Lemuel of Israel.
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.900]   We don't see that in history.
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.580]   We should encourage you because the other kings
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.500]   we see in history, the history books,
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.380]   show us who they were.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.660]   We don't see this one.
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.180]   King Lemuel means devoted to God or the fruit of my vows.
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.740]   So people think that it's Solomon, talking about Solomon,
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.660]   but it says really who wrote it
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.180]   is actually King Lemuel's mom, which would be Bathsheba.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.180]   And so this scripture would have written by Bathsheba.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.600]   And here's why, it's a loving mother, a wise mother,
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.660]   giving instruction to her kid of,
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.140]   hey, this is who I'm praying that you end up with.
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.900]   Proverbs 31, verse 10 through 31,
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:14.100]   is actually a poem, it's an acrostic.
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.780]   And so there's 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet.
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.540]   Every line starts with one of those letters.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.980]   If it was written, if it was done in English,
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.220]   it would be like, you know, A is for apple, B is for,
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.780]   and so that's an acrostic.
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.980]   As you go down, it's the first letter
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.420]   of every letter of the Hebrew alphabet.
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.840]   And so this is a mother giving instruction to her children.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.140]   Hey, this is what you look for.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.540]   And here's the promises that it makes,
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.020]   that if you find this woman, it says,
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.380]   her husband is respected at the city gates
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.420]   where he takes his seat among the elders of the land.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.180]   Every man here, ladies,
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.060]   I'm gonna give you some good advice here.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.940]   Every man here wants to feel respected.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.220]   He has a deep desire inside of him to feel respected.
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.600]   And specifically when he gets married,
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.940]   he wants to feel respected by his wife.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.460]   This text says, hey, you find the right woman
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.780]   and you're gonna be respected not only by her,
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.180]   but all of the people of the land.
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.740]   It goes on to say the promise to the woman,
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.900]   it says that her children arise and call her blessed,
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.140]   her husband also, and he praises her.
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.780]   Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.280]   This is the words of her husband.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.580]   Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.260]   And it says, and then the command to the guy,
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.420]   because this text was not written to women.
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.020]   This text, this is not the,
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.860]   hey, here's what you must be women.
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.060]   This is, hey guys, here's what you should value.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.200]   Here's what you should look for.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.580]   And it ends with an instruction to the men.
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:44.580]   It says this, honor her for all that her hands have done
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:50.140]   and let her works bring her praise at the city gates,
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.700]   which was not something that was done in Israel.
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.660]   And so this is extraordinary praise
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.480]   for an extraordinary woman.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.680]   It is the gold standard.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.860]   Ladies, can I tell you something?
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.900]   For the next few minutes,
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.060]   you're really gonna have to fight something.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.960]   Comparison.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.200]   All right, so let's resolve your heart right now
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.060]   that you don't let it turn downward,
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.340]   that you don't grow discouraged
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.780]   because there's hope in this text.
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.140]   So hang in there with me as we move through this text
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.440]   that it would not beat you down.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.340]   And so Proverbs 31, we're gonna look at seven qualities.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.380]   Yes, seven from this text.
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.060]   I've read commentaries that listed 31.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.380]   I read commentaries that listed 10.
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.060]   I looked at here, I think we can dumb it down
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.580]   to seven qualities to look for as you're dating someone.
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:39.480]   What is dating?
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.540]   My friend Daniel Crawford next door,
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.460]   he gave me this definition, I love it.
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.280]   It says assessing someone's suitability as a spouse.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.220]   How do I assess someone's suitability as a spouse?
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.780]   This text, men, this text will help you do that.
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.020]   Verse 10, let's go.
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:01.300]   A wife of noble character who can find,
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.900]   she is worth far more than rubies.
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.540]   Where it says a wife of noble character,
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.020]   it could also be translated in the Hebrew, a capable wife.
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.820]   Okay, it's saying, hey, this thing,
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.340]   you have to seek her out.
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.060]   She is difficult to find, but if you find her,
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.660]   she's more valuable than rubies.
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.340]   Right off the bat, you have an application,
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.060]   men, you have to find her,
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.020]   which means you have to look for her,
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.500]   which means you're going to have to take a risk.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.260]   You're going to have to get out there and search for her.
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.140]   She is not, while you're watching the Cowboys game,
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.740]   gonna fall through the roof and land on your lap.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.600]   That's not going to happen, all right?
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.020]   You have to seek this woman out.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.100]   Her husband has full confidence in her
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.560]   and lacks nothing of value.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.340]   She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life.
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.100]   And so it says right off the bat,
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.860]   what we're looking for, one of the qualities,
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.960]   you are looking for someone who is faithful.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.100]   That's the first quality, faithful, you can write that down.
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.560]   She should be faithful.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.080]   Now let's make that practical.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.900]   What does that mean?
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.540]   It means she's trustworthy.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.780]   It means that she does what she says she's going to do.
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.860]   You can ask yourself that question, what does she do?
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.020]   How do I know if she's faithful?
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.740]   Well, does she do what she says she's going to do?
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.620]   Does she use her words to build up?
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.960]   Does she gossip?
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.300]   Because that breaks trust.
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.220]   And you have to trust this woman.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.300]   This is your life partner we're talking about.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.460]   Like a marriage has to be built on trust.
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.180]   If there is no trust, there is no marriage.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.740]   And so this woman should be known for her integrity.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.980]   You know this is true if you've ever been
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.660]   in an untrustworthy relationship.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.640]   It is miserable.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.140]   I've been in one, you guys are nodding your head,
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.740]   getting whiplash back there.
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.580]   It is terrible.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.620]   Causes you so much pain, you feel trapped in a prison,
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.540]   but you can't get out.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.340]   And so this is a big problem.
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.340]   It's really interesting.
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.940]   Fox News two weeks ago actually asked me to write a response
[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:11.940]   an article about this girl who made a list of 22 things
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:12.960]   that her boyfriend had to do.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.220]   Did anybody see this?
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:19.060]   Yeah, here's a picture of this list.
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.660]   And so it's like, hey, you are not to have
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.140]   single girls numbers.
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.860]   If I text you, you have to get back.
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.280]   You have to respond within 10 minutes.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.740]   If I catch you with another girl, I will kill you, okay?
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.580]   Wow.
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:36.540]   She says you can't hang out with these particular friends.
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.740]   All right, I'm looking at that.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:38.580]   So I read it.
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.780]   They say, hey, we want you to write a response to this.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.600]   I'm reading it.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.980]   I'm like, man, my response is that that relationship
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.300]   is no longer intact.
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.820]   Okay, the way they found this list is this guy traded
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.060]   in his car and whoever got the car,
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:52.980]   the list was still in there.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.820]   He posted it on the internet and said, oh, this poor soul.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:00.500]   And it went mega viral, like worldwide viral.
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.900]   And so they said, hey, respond to this.
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.820]   And I said, listen, that marriage is doomed
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.440]   because there's no trust there.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.740]   That's not healthy.
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.580]   You have to be able to trust each other.
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.260]   Now, listen, let me say this to you guys.
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260]   Just because you don't trust her doesn't mean
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.520]   she's not trustworthy.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:24.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.880]   Little subtle rumble there.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:30.840]   Mm, a lot of, hey, just listen, dear in this message,
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.440]   let's not elbow each other, point, okay?
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.780]   Don't do that.
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:40.140]   Just because you don't trust her doesn't mean
[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.300]   she's not trustworthy.
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.380]   It may be your issue.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.660]   You may not be trustworthy.
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.540]   Untrustworthy people don't trust people.
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.900]   That's a fact.
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.660]   Untrustworthy people don't trust people
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.820]   because they're afraid that someone's gonna do to them
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.700]   what they're already doing behind their back.
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.360]   And so I'm talking about if you have evidence or proof
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.360]   that, hey, she is not trustworthy or she is not faithful.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.780]   And so if she's faithful, how does she care for her home?
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.260]   Verse 13, she selects wool and flax
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.940]   and works with eager hands.
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:18.940]   Flax is used to make a really fine linen.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.240]   And where it says she's eager to use her hands,
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.240]   what it's actually saying is she enjoys it.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.120]   Like she finds joy out of doing these things.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.140]   In context, it says she is like the merchant ships
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.220]   bringing her food from afar,
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.660]   which is such a beautiful text because what it's saying is
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.340]   she's like the people, people who are around her
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.260]   are like the people standing at the docks.
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.900]   And when food comes in from all of these lands,
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.140]   it's exciting things.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.660]   It's things they've never seen.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.620]   It's saying that when you sit down to a meal
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.940]   that she's made, you don't know what it is.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.220]   You don't know what to expect.
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.380]   It could be anything.
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.420]   She's not serving you hamburger helper.
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.900]   Like she's coming up with creative things,
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.700]   which I just love that that's in the text.
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.580]   It says she gets up while it is still night.
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.940]   She provides food for her family
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.660]   and portions for her female servants.
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.100]   What this text is saying is she's able to assess
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.180]   the needs of her family.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.420]   And so my second quality to look for is,
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.260]   is she attentive to the needs of her home?
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.900]   Attentive to the needs of her home.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.580]   This is something that you're going to want
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.140]   in someone that you're going to spend
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.300]   the rest of your life with.
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.620]   What does that mean?
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.420]   Practically speaking, it's talking about
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.020]   her caring for her family.
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.540]   Does she love children?
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.140]   You're like, well, how do I know if she loves children?
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.820]   Well, she wants to be around them.
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.380]   You know, I'm gonna babysit,
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:37.620]   I'm gonna keep so and so's, you know,
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.820]   I just love their kids, you know.
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.100]   Love when they're around.
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.260]   Why is that important?
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:49.260]   Well, because a huge part of marriage is raising children.
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.140]   And what I've seen in the generations that are,
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.540]   my generation and the generation behind me,
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:59.140]   Gen Z, is we get self-absorbed and selfish
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.020]   and we start to think, you know,
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.940]   I don't, kids kind of get in the way.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.180]   I mean, I do weddings sometimes where we're talking
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.380]   with people, they're like, well, you know,
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.740]   yeah, we're gonna travel the world and then we'll have kids.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.140]   And I'm like, what I would tell you is travel the world now
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.420]   because marriage is about family.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.140]   And what God's view of kids is,
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.580]   he says they're a blessing from the Lord.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.780]   Have lots of them.
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:23.860]   That's what the Lord says.
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.940]   And so if you don't view kids as a blessing,
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.100]   you don't view children like God does.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.260]   And you should consider that.
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.300]   Now, listen, if you can't have kids,
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.580]   that's not a disqualifier at all.
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.500]   You can adopt, you can decide.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.420]   I've got a friend in ministry that he and his wife,
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.300]   they never had children, but they have poured their life
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:46.300]   into millions, literally millions of kids.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.500]   That's a life well-lived.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.020]   And so what does it look like to love children?
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.260]   This woman has skills, you know, to make a house a home.
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.420]   Homemaker is such, like it has negative connotation today.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:05.300]   I reject that because I think God's word rejects that.
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.460]   It is a compliment.
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.420]   It is a gift.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.140]   And so here's the encouragement to you, ladies,
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.700]   is if you're like out there and you're like,
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.460]   yeah, but that's not me.
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:19.420]   You know, this is a great time to work on those skills.
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.420]   It's not a non-negotiable for you.
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.420]   I'll just say, like my wife, she doesn't love to cook.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.100]   It's, she has a ton of gifts, like a long list of gifts.
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.460]   Cooking's not like on the first couple of pages.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.140]   And so we eat out a lot and that's okay.
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.740]   I like to eat out and so we've got a budget, we stick to it.
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.740]   It works, we've had a great marriage.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.340]   And so I'm not, don't be discouraged if that's not you,
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.620]   but this is something that is straight from this proverb.
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.780]   And so I'm putting it before you.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.460]   And so right now there's some women in the room,
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.500]   they're like, oh, but you know,
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.700]   he's against, you know, working outside the home
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.540]   and you know, this and that.
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.540]   No, not at all, no.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.540]   This woman works outside the home.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.580]   This text goes out of its way to show
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.980]   that this woman works outside the home.
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.220]   She works outside the home, she works inside the home.
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.140]   She does a lot of work.
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.980]   That's this woman, Proverbs 31 here.
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.980]   But let me show you that she works outside the home.
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.900]   It's 16, she considers a field and buys it.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.340]   Out of her earnings, she plants a vineyard.
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.620]   She sets about her work vigorously.
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.380]   Her arms are strong for her tasks.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.380]   And so men, what you're looking for,
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.660]   a woman with big arms, okay?
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.940]   That's gonna be important.
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.820]   She sees that her trading is profitable
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.740]   and her lamp does not go out at night.
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.100]   In her hand, she holds the distaff
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.820]   and grasps the spindle for her fingers.
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.500]   A distaff is something for sewing or knitting.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.420]   And then also in verse 24, it says,
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.740]   she makes linen garments and sells them
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.460]   and supplies the merchants with sashes.
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.500]   This lady is getting after it.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.020]   She has jobs upon jobs outside the home, okay?
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:50.860]   That's the truth.
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.300]   And so my third quality that you're looking for,
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.880]   that you would consider is that she's not lazy.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.300]   That she's not lazy.
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.420]   She's going to have to do a lot of work.
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.580]   Men, here's why.
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.060]   Because being married to you is a lot of work.
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.780]   And I know from experience,
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.620]   being married to me is a lot of work, okay?
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.460]   A lot of work.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.980]   And so it's, listen, marriage is hard.
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.900]   You guys ever heard that, marriage is hard?
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:22.740]   You ever heard that?
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.940]   Anybody sick of hearing that?
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.300]   I'm so sick of hearing how marriage, how hard it is.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.540]   Let me tell you the truth.
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.740]   Let me tell you the truth.
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.820]   Life is hard.
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.700]   That's the truth.
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.700]   Men, let me talk to you for a minute.
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.100]   Men, life is hard.
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.100]   That's why you need a helper.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.820]   That's what the scripture calls a wife, a helper.
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.100]   Can I tell you something before you get offended
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:45.940]   and walk out?
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.180]   It's what the scripture calls the Holy Spirit, God,
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.300]   a helper.
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.300]   And I'm not saying that you can't be a helper.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.140]   You can be a helper.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:01.460]   And do you know why you need a helper, men?
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.220]   Because we need help.
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.220]   That's simple, right?
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.140]   We're just some dudes that need some help.
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.340]   And so God in his kindness is like, hey, let me help you.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.540]   I will not only give you my Holy Spirit to help you,
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:18.220]   but I will create an amazing, beautiful creature
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:23.220]   that is as incredible in the way that he's wired her
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.060]   to come alongside you.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.900]   And so, you know, it's going to be important
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:33.100]   that she is not lazy,
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.740]   because the job before you, and it's not just marriage,
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.460]   it's life, is hard.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.740]   Like I've got a hard job.
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:39.940]   You know, I love my job.
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:40.940]   I love where I work.
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.620]   I love who I work with.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.260]   But I write a term paper every week.
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.540]   I listen to, in the form of a sermon,
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.620]   I listen to people's problems every day.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.980]   You know, there's some difficulties with it.
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:51.820]   Let me tell you something.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.860]   I couldn't trade my wife for her job, not for one second.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.340]   I am not one of those dudes like,
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.180]   my job's harder than hers.
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.580]   No, her job is so much harder than mine.
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.780]   It's so much harder than mine.
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.340]   And so as you think about marriage,
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.100]   you need to know what the job is in order to find
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.580]   the person that you're going to partner with.
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.420]   Okay?
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.240]   Like, let me just tell you,
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.900]   'cause I know you're thinking, well, you know,
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.940]   I just want someone who's fun and hot.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.660]   This actually comes from the book, if you've read it.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.860]   And so when I was in high school,
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.940]   I had this huge crush with this girl in my class.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.780]   We'll call her Kelly.
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:33.900]   It's a made up name.
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:37.660]   And we were being partnered up,
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.140]   guys and girls being partnered up.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.900]   And so I'm sitting there and the teacher's going around
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.380]   and I'm like, please, please put me with Kelly.
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.220]   Please.
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.140]   I'm like, I don't even believe in God,
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.260]   but I'm like, God, please put me with Kelly.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:51.100]   And at the time, and I believe in God now,
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.380]   just in case you were wondering.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.140]   Big, big fan of God.
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:59.300]   And so she's going around and she's like, okay,
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.980]   we'll do Jeff and Elizabeth.
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.440]   All right, we're going to do John and Jennifer.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.400]   And then she's like, all right, we'll do Jonathan.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.620]   And I'm like, please, please, Jesus, please.
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.300]   Kelly, I'm like, yes.
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.140]   You know?
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.060]   And because I was attracted to Kelly, she was attractive.
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.900]   And the assignment was,
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.460]   I just didn't consider what the assignment was.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.140]   The assignment was we were going to dissect frogs.
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:23.740]   And Kelly was cute, but she hated frogs,
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:24.980]   especially the dead kind.
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.540]   And she didn't want to touch them at all.
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:29.660]   And that was challenging
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.460]   because I wasn't very good at biology.
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.220]   And I was really hoping that she was going to be smart.
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.600]   And, you know, and so now we are in this partnership
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.840]   and she's not very good at the assignment.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:49.020]   And that describes more than half of the marriages I see.
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.340]   I just chose someone.
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:55.140]   I didn't consider what the assignment was, right?
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.660]   I just were hoping they would be good at sex.
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.540]   Not the 99.4% of all the other stuff
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.800]   we talked about last week.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.700]   The sex, if you have a lot of it,
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.240]   a lot of it is 0.6% of the time.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.000]   What about the 99.4% of all the other stuff?
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.100]   You want to make sure that you both are good at that.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.260]   It's interesting.
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.980]   Like we make so much decisions.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.500]   I'm talking to you guys.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.220]   So much decisions around sex.
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.420]   I just think that's true in dating.
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.260]   And a big driver for that is like,
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:33.580]   I want her to be attractive.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.740]   Is sex better with attractive people?
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:39.060]   Don't answer out loud.
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.980]   I mean, just, just think about it.
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:45.780]   I'm just gonna let you think about it.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.780]   I'm just gonna let you think about it.
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:51.780]   She opens her arms to the poor
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.880]   and extends her hands to the needy.
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:58.300]   Another quality, my fourth quality that marks this woman
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.020]   is that she's tender to the needs of others.
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:03.700]   Keep in mind, this is the gold standard, all right?
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.620]   These are not all non-negotiables.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.440]   These are good ideas if they're there.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.460]   This is what a mother prayed for her son.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.680]   She's tender to the needs of others.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.300]   And so is she tender to the needs of, JP, how would I know?
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.660]   Does she text encouraging things to people
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:17.500]   when they need it?
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.380]   Does she lift their spirits?
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.820]   Is she writing notes?
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.820]   Is she thinking about the needs of others around her?
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.380]   Does she desire to give?
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.580]   Is she serving, right?
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.500]   This is so big.
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.340]   Is she serving?
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.220]   That's like half the battle.
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.540]   Is she involved in a church?
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.620]   And serving there, giving of her time there.
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.460]   This is huge.
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.340]   It comes from Genesis chapter 24.
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.060]   Here's what's going on.
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.380]   Abraham, you guys heard of Abraham?
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.300]   Abraham is looking for a wife for his son, Isaac.
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.140]   And so what he does, and we can learn a lot from this,
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.940]   he gets his servant, Eleazar, and he says,
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:50.740]   "Hey, I want you to go and find my son a wife."
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:54.820]   Right, now this is crazy that Eleazar
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:59.060]   can find Isaac a wife when they haven't met or anything
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.700]   because he knows what he's looking for.
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.980]   That's the difference between us and them.
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:05.060]   See, in Bible times, you literally could just
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.180]   leave the house with a list.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.420]   You could go up to somebody like,
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.440]   "Check, check, check, check, I do."
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.620]   You know, I mean, you could do that then, right?
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.140]   And we've complicated things since then.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.240]   And so Eleazar leaves, and he's looking,
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.340]   and he's like, "So where does he go?"
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.940]   He goes where servants hang out.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.140]   He goes to the well, and he prays.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.620]   He says, "Lord, would you send someone to me
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.300]   "who is a servant, who would not only give me water,
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.160]   "but also water my camels?"
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.580]   Now, a well in those times, it was like a flight of stairs
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.540]   that went into the ground.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.140]   It was hard work to fill up buckets of water
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:38.520]   and then walk those stories of stairs.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.660]   And then Rebekah comes up and says,
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.580]   "Here's some water, and let me go
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.220]   "and also get some for your camels."
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.620]   And so he's looking for someone who serves.
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.700]   He goes where servants go,
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.900]   and he chooses someone who served.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.300]   This is such a novel idea.
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.940]   And then they get married.
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.460]   And it was that simple.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.160]   Why is it not that simple anymore?
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.940]   Gotta have chemistry, JP, chemistry.
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.620]   So important.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.240]   (JP sighs)
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:15.140]   My bride, she has this in spades.
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:19.860]   Super sensitive to the needs of others.
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.940]   Like she goes, she comes into a room,
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.660]   and it's like her superpower, okay?
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.060]   She's a kindergarten teacher,
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:29.060]   and she just like walks into a room,
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.400]   and she finds the most vulnerable person
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.420]   and just moves to them.
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.700]   It's like a magic trick she does.
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.860]   Like whether it's a baby or an elderly person
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.380]   or someone who had a bad day,
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.760]   I mean, she can just smell it from across the room
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.860]   and move to 'em and just love on 'em
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.800]   and encourage 'em like crazy.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.100]   I mean, she is nurturer through and through.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:51.020]   And so our marriage faced a really big challenge this year.
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.360]   I mean, probably one of the biggest challenges
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.380]   in 14 years of marriage.
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.540]   We got a puppy.
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:00.500]   And so just, I thought,
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.300]   you know, we're gonna let the puppy inside,
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.460]   and it's gonna be all good.
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.980]   And I didn't consider how nurturing she is.
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.020]   And she likes to put ice in the bowl
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.740]   and make sure the water's of a good temperature
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.820]   and that it's comfortable and that the TV's on
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.060]   when we're not there so they're entertained.
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.700]   And that's all lost on me.
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.980]   I'm like, we're not doing any of that.
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.640]   You know, we're not, no.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.340]   Okay, fine.
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:25.740]   And so, you know, and if I'm honest with you,
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.980]   if I'm just putting it all out there,
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.340]   I'm jealous of the dog.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:32.260]   I'm like, stop showing her so much attention, you know?
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.700]   I'm over here, you know?
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.540]   And,
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:43.320]   and I know that I need a little bit more
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.300]   of that in my life.
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:48.560]   Like, I think Christ would walk into a room,
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.620]   I know he would, in fact,
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:54.500]   and be finally in tune with the greatest needs
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.620]   and move to the person who is most vulnerable.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:02.400]   And so, you know, are they tender to the needs of others?
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.560]   Do they tend to the needs of others?
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.520]   Are they tender to the needs of others?
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.960]   It goes on to say, verse 21,
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.380]   when it snows, she has no fear for her household,
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:16.040]   for all of them are clothed in scarlet.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.080]   She makes coverings for her bed.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.040]   She is clothed in fine linen and purple.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.520]   I want to focus on the clothed in scarlet
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.000]   and she's clothed in fine linen and purple
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.440]   and she makes coverings for her bed.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.080]   And so this is kind of a strange one,
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.760]   but if I, I just, I see it clearly in the text.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.800]   And so number five, aesthete.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.160]   Okay, anybody heard of this word, aesthete?
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.960]   I hadn't either.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.880]   Is she aesthete?
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.720]   Here's what it means.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.440]   It's where we get the word aesthetics.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:51.480]   Does she care about making things pretty?
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.480]   And you're like, really?
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.800]   That's like on the list of non-negotiable,
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.640]   dude, it's from Proverbs 31, all right?
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.480]   You argue with the scripture.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.200]   But here's why I think the Holy Spirit
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.520]   preserved this text for thousands of years
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.320]   so that we can read it and apply it to our lives today.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.000]   It's because if I'm honest,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.380]   like as I just think through the sexes and the genders
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.460]   and the roles that we play,
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.640]   you know, a lot of guys don't care if things are pretty.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.320]   And God's like, I like things to be pretty, I'm a creator.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.240]   And so if you're gonna have a home,
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.320]   I want things to be pretty.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.560]   Guys are kind of like function over,
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.080]   I'm sorry, function over form.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.720]   Like we just want things to work, right?
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.800]   And we don't care if they're pretty.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.280]   And girls are like, no, I want it to work
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.380]   and I want it to look good, right?
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.720]   And so you make your home pretty.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.160]   And so you know that if you think I'm lying, right?
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.880]   Like you know that you went to some guy's apartment
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.960]   and you had to go to the bathroom
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.360]   and you went somewhere else.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.120]   You're like, I am not going in there.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.360]   It is a biological experiment in there
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.840]   and I'm not setting foot in his bed.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.620]   He's growing mold in there, right?
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:05.220]   And that's just what some guys do.
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:09.560]   And I'm telling you, these aren't non-negotiables.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.120]   And so Monica and I had the opportunity to build a house
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.480]   and you know, people will walk in and say,
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.400]   oh, is that Monica?
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.240]   Oh, did she do?
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.560]   And I'm like, nope, that was me.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.300]   And so I tend to be the one in the relationship
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.560]   that cares more about this.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.400]   And so that's okay.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.480]   Like if that's where you're at,
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.360]   you're finding balance, you know how God made you,
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.760]   how God wired you up and you're looking for someone
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:29.920]   to compliment that.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.880]   And so that's all right.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.480]   Again, these aren't non-negotiables,
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.280]   not all of them anyways.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.840]   And so it says she is clothed with strength and dignity.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.760]   She can laugh at the days to come.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.120]   She speaks with wisdom and faithful instruction
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.000]   is on her tongue.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.360]   She watches over the affairs of her household
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:48.520]   and does not eat the bread of idleness.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:52.720]   Another quality is she's sensible in preparation.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.560]   That's number six.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.920]   She is sensible in preparation.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.640]   Sensible means chosen in accordance with wisdom.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.120]   She makes choices according to the knowledge that she has.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.160]   It says that she speaks with wisdom.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.120]   She's clothed in strength and dignity.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.000]   And it says that she can laugh at the days to come
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.980]   because she's prepared.
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.400]   So as she looks at the challenges that they're facing,
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.880]   she has a plan for that.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.440]   She's prepared for that.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.520]   And she watches over the affairs of her household.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.420]   She is not idle.
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.960]   She shows care for the future.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.080]   This also comes from verse 18 where it says,
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.160]   "Her lamp does not go out at night."
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.680]   Like the virgins who stopped preparing
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.400]   and they let their lamps go out in the New Testament,
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.460]   that phrase in the Hebrew, lamps do not go out at night,
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.120]   means she's prepared.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.040]   She has a plan.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.260]   Now I'm not saying that she's OCD.
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.920]   I'm not saying that she's super high strung,
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.320]   like constantly planning.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:51.560]   I'm just saying that she's not given to manis and pettis
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.280]   and happy hours and spray tanning
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.000]   over actually getting ready
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.080]   for what she needs to be getting ready for.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.320]   Like being aware of what is coming at her.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.640]   And this preparedness, it leads to confidence.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.260]   It says she laughs at the days to come.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.440]   And so on our kitchen table,
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.600]   you walk into my house at any given time,
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:20.040]   and right there on the kitchen table is my wife's chair.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.520]   And on her chair is a purse.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.560]   And in the chair is her Bible study bag,
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.360]   which is like books and books.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:31.540]   And then on the table is an old school calendar
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:35.240]   that she buys every January from Barnes and Noble.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.840]   And she, at night, we put the kids down
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.300]   and she sits down in that chair and she just goes to work.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.840]   Man, she's got colored markers.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.280]   She's got a marker for every color of her thoughts,
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.080]   you know, and just like writing down on Tuesday.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.360]   Tuesday, you're going, where are you traveling?
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.320]   Okay, and you're speaking, okay.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.880]   And then Thursday, what are we doing?
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.440]   This weekend, we got soccer games and this.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.380]   And she's just, you know, marking stuff up,
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.800]   grabbing the yellow and the red and the green.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   And she just does it every night.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.540]   I'm so glad she does 'cause I'm awful at that.
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:06.600]   And so here in Dallas, it's been raining since 2012.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:11.600]   And so we've like rescheduled all of the soccer games,
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.020]   the kids' soccer games.
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.440]   Basically, we have to play a whole season of soccer games
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.960]   in two weeks, that's a true story.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.720]   And so that's just meant, that's changed everything.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.080]   So the sun came out and so did soccer games.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.000]   And so she's just writing, okay, we can't do that.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.760]   We've got a soccer game, soccer game, soccer game.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.160]   And it's like playing Tetris, moving this stuff around,
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.360]   but she's great at it.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.600]   And it's so helpful.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.200]   And so I'm not saying that your wife can't be spontaneous.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.800]   I'm not saying she can't be artsy and fun,
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.420]   but I am saying that what this mama prayed for her son
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.420]   is that he would find someone who's sensible in preparation.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:50.620]   And then it says, verse 30,
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:54.020]   "Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting."
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:58.180]   My daughters say this verse every day to me
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:02.160]   before they get out of the car for school.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.100]   "Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting,
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.500]   but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised."
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:14.500]   I love what the author is doing here.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:19.300]   They juxtapose chemistry with the fear of God.
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:23.620]   And so you say, what does the Bible value?
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:27.940]   I would say the Bible values the fear of God
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.180]   infinitely times more than chemistry.
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.480]   That's the truth.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.540]   And I use infinitely more.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.100]   That's not, I'm not even over speaking.
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.380]   Like I could say a hundred times more, a thousand times more,
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:42.860]   infinitely times more, the Bible values,
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.620]   the wisdom of God and the Holy Spirit values
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.380]   the fear of God over chemistry.
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:52.340]   And so my seventh quality is she yielded to God.
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.920]   Ladies, I want you to be encouraged
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.920]   because this is really the only one that's a non-negotiable.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:02.640]   The other ones are, they're nice to have.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.740]   They may help you be prepared.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.560]   But as I said last week,
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.980]   what if it's as simple as finding
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.260]   the most godly person you can,
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.780]   being the most godly person you can
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.840]   and finding the most godly person you can and marrying them?
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.720]   What if it's that simple?
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.380]   What if we've complicated things?
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.540]   And so number seven, they have to be yielded to God.
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.860]   Here's what that means is there's people listening right now
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.620]   here in Dallas and Fort Worth, El Paso, Tulsa,
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.700]   driving in their car, streaming on the internet,
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.720]   sitting in their apartment,
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:37.420]   and you don't even know God and you're not dateable.
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.340]   You're not marriage material.
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:45.020]   Followers of Jesus should run from you as fast as they can
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.420]   unless they're seeking to share the gospel with you.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.660]   And even in that, I'd encourage you
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.220]   to find someone of the same sex.
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.460]   And so what you need to do, the good news is,
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.340]   it's very simple.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.140]   What you need to hear is that Jesus Christ,
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.380]   that God loves you so much,
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.740]   he sent his only son, Jesus Christ, to this earth
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.680]   to die for your sins, to pay the price for your sins
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.300]   so that you don't have to go to hell
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.740]   and pay the price for your sins.
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.980]   Your sins have been paid for on the cross.
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:13.100]   And that God, to show his infinite power,
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.300]   he raised his son, Jesus, from the dead.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.360]   It really happened.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.860]   That's how he became the single most notorious character
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.540]   in the history of history.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.000]   He rose from the dead.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.300]   Paul says there's 500 people who saw him.
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.140]   They're still alive.
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.380]   Go ask them, he writes to the Corinthians.
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:31.560]   And when we trust in him that he died for our sins,
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.500]   God raised him from the dead,
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.960]   his Holy Spirit comes in our lives.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.580]   And here's the other good news, ladies.
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.700]   What that Holy Spirit does is it makes you godly.
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.060]   So if you're sitting out there and you're like,
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:43.300]   man, I'm just not there, I'm not perfect,
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.500]   you don't need to be perfect.
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.020]   You have a savior who's perfect,
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:49.260]   and his Holy Spirit is working inside of you
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.800]   to one day complete you
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.140]   so that you would be perfect before Christ
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.420]   until then you live in an imperfect world
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:57.780]   and you don't need to be perfect.
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:58.980]   Guys, I'm talking to you now.
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.100]   Gentlemen, I'm talking to you.
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.540]   You're not looking for perfect,
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.000]   you're looking for practical.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.320]   You're not looking for someone who's perfectly made for you
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.640]   because she doesn't exist, because you are so messed up.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.640]   You're looking for someone who practically compliments you
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.280]   so that you can marry and serve God together.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.520]   They love God, you love God, you come together,
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.260]   you love God together, and you raise children to love God.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:29.400]   You have them, you adopt them, you disciple them
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.800]   however you can.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.700]   This is God's plan for the world.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.360]   At some point we moved away from it.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.680]   When did we move away from it?
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.320]   When did our selfishness infiltrate this plan?
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.280]   Are we more happy?
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.120]   No.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:40.940]   Are we happier?
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:41.780]   No.
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:42.600]   Are we more depressed?
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.440]   Yes.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.280]   Are we despairing more?
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.100]   Yes.
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.160]   Are suicide rates at an all-time high?
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.360]   Yes, they are.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:51.300]   What if we just went back to the basics?
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:55.100]   What if we just started to learn from the creator?
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.180]   We went back to his design, and we said,
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:00.320]   okay, I'm gonna scrub out all the trash
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:04.760]   that Hollywood taught me, and I'm just gonna go back to this.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:09.780]   Listen, my wife and I, we weren't following Christ
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:10.620]   when we met.
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.940]   We were idiots.
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.000]   I was a bigger idiot than she was,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.420]   but both of us were not following Christ.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.940]   And around the same time, God in his mercy
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:26.700]   introduced us to him through his son, Jesus Christ,
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.020]   and our lives began to radically change.
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.160]   And marriage was not an option for us until then.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.060]   You know what our relationship looked like before then?
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:34.340]   We would get together, we'd break up,
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.320]   we'd get together, we'd break up.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.200]   I love you, I hate you, you walk home,
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.200]   I never wanna see you again.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.200]   You did what with who, when, where, why?
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.980]   Talking to me.
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:48.440]   And then God came into our lives and began to sanctify us,
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.920]   that is, making us like him.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:56.200]   And as we began to pursue him together,
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:00.160]   he did a work in our relationships.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.860]   And this work is available to you.
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:07.440]   Man, you're not looking for the perfect,
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.960]   you're looking for practical.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:18.860]   Chemistry, biblically speaking, how important is chemistry?
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.520]   It's not.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.760]   Some of you, you haven't experienced chemistry, men,
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.280]   because you've experienced chemistry
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.860]   with thousands of two-dimensional images on your iPhone
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:35.200]   for the past six years, or 16 years.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.720]   And so chemistry, long-term, is not available to you.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.480]   You need to get well, gentlemen.
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:45.040]   You need to heal.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:48.720]   You need to return to the gospel.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:54.800]   But if you are well, and you desire marriage,
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.520]   it is available to you.
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:01.040]   There are godly women all around you right now.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.920]   Just because she's here doesn't mean she's godly,
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.520]   but I know there are godly women all around you,
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.720]   sitting in front of you, and beside you,
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.280]   and behind you, take notice.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:16.640]   And so I get it all the time.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.600]   Let me just address this.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.120]   It's like, what if I'm not attracted to her?
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.900]   What if I'm not attracted to her?
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:26.520]   Your friend told me last week, lovingly, just said,
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.440]   you know, I feel like you're saying,
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.040]   like, if I'm dating someone who's godly,
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.240]   like, they're really godly, they have a God-fearing heart,
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.760]   but I just not feeling it, and I break up,
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.400]   I feel like you're saying something's wrong with me.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.100]   So here's how I responded to that.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:42.080]   That's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:45.040]   There is something wrong with you.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.720]   It's called sin.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.120]   It's wrong with all of us.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.380]   And we're not attracted to yet
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.560]   the things that God's attracted to.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.880]   In 1 Samuel 16, he says,
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.800]   "I do not look at the outer appearance.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.320]   "I look at the heart.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:58.840]   "I'm attracted to the heart."
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:43:59.900]   And so you say, well, what do I do?
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:00.800]   Am I just supposed to marry them?
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.780]   No, absolutely not.
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.360]   No, no, you break up, and you work on you.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.840]   And you go, and you say, God, why am I not attracted
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.620]   to the things that you're attracted to?
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.760]   Would you grow me spiritually to the point
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.360]   where I would be attracted to the things
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:14.600]   that you're attracted to?
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:20.800]   Right, what role does chemistry or attraction play
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:21.840]   in an arranged marriage,
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.640]   which is our example in biblical times.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.800]   I know it's not much today anymore,
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.080]   but in biblical times, Eliezer,
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.660]   Isaac had never seen Rebekah.
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.720]   He didn't have a choice
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.780]   whether he was physically attracted to her or not.
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:38.600]   He just entrusted that huge decision to someone else
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.360]   because that someone knew what they were looking for.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:45.200]   Gentlemen, you gotta know what you're looking for.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.160]   It says in verse 31, honor her
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.760]   for all that her hands have done,
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.600]   and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.040]   Honor her.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:58.320]   To love and to cherish, we say at a wedding, honor her.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.920]   Okay, what if I'm not attracted?
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.560]   You have to, you ready, gentlemen?
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:02.520]   There's the answer to that question.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.020]   You have to be able to cherish her.
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:09.320]   If you can't cherish her, don't waste her time
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.240]   for two seconds, but for the rest of your life,
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.540]   you have to be able to choose to cherish her
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:17.720]   because there will be times when she's not attractive
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.300]   to you, there will be times
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.200]   where you don't find her attractive.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.040]   That's the truth.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.400]   She's not gonna find you attractive either on days,
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.460]   seasons, months at a time, that's going to happen,
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:31.480]   but you have to choose to cherish her in those moments.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:35.960]   In fact, there's a ballet guy,
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.860]   are they called ballerinas too?
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.640]   They are, you sure?
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.000]   Okay, 'cause this is going on the podcast
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.700]   and I don't want, it's like forever on there.
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:48.340]   Okay, dude ballerina, that's what they're called.
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:53.060]   And he said, he just said, hey, ballet is about the woman.
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:58.960]   And he said, my job as her partner is to highlight her.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.840]   He said, to make the beautiful more beautiful.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:07.220]   And he said, she's amazing on her own,
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.100]   but with me, she can fly higher.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   And people come to see her display the art and the beauty.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.100]   And when I say cherish, man, that's what I'm talking about,
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.440]   that you would get with that woman
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.340]   and that you would highlight her beauty
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.940]   'cause you know who's beautiful?
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:29.780]   A woman who is well-loved is beautiful.
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:33.180]   When someone is loved well, they become more beautiful
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:34.740]   and more beautiful and more beautiful.
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:36.320]   George Strait was right when he said,
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.620]   you look so good in love.
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.980]   And that was George Strait, right?
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:42.240]   Okay, good, I thought it was ludicrous, but.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.120]   Oh, he's a fantasy guy.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.940]   Anyways, here's the reality.
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:53.720]   You show me a woman who's been loved well,
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.920]   and I will show you someone who's beautiful.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.320]   And so if you wanna be married
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.920]   to someone who's hot, gentlemen,
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:03.880]   you marry someone and you love them like crazy.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:08.580]   You cherish them, that's the truth.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.800]   That's the reality.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.320]   I've seen a lot of beautiful women jump into marriages
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:18.280]   and fade like flowers, cut from their source
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:23.140]   because they didn't marry cherishing husbands.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:27.800]   And so what's not in this list, right?
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.260]   Age isn't in this list.
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:36.000]   She's, you know, that doesn't value.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:40.240]   If she's older than you, she may be an amazing wife.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.440]   It doesn't say, is she a virgin?
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.880]   Doesn't say, does she have kids?
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.960]   There's some amazing women here who have children
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.860]   that would be incredible wives to you.
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.360]   Can she have kids?
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.480]   That's not on the list.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:52.760]   Is she a good kisser?
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:57.480]   It's dumb, I know, you're gonna laugh 'cause it's stupid.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:00.500]   Does she come from a good family?
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.240]   What does she look like?
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.740]   None of this stuff's on there.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.260]   Are you asking the right questions?
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:13.600]   I know you think through the lens of sex, I get it,
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.040]   'cause I do too.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.480]   Here, let me say something crazy.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:25.020]   If she has all of these things,
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:28.880]   but y'all can't even have sex,
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.480]   you can't experience intimacy,
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.760]   your marriage is going to be better
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.100]   than if she has none of these things,
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.760]   but she's amazing in bed.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:43.220]   Get your head around that.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:46.840]   That's true.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.680]   You say, well, how do you know?
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.240]   'Cause I talk to a lot of people.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.200]   They'll talk to pastors about anything.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:49:00.200]   In summary, is she faithful?
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.920]   Is she attentive to the needs of her home?
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.160]   Is she not lazy?
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:11.000]   Is she tender to the needs of others?
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.320]   Is she aesthete?
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:16.840]   Is she sensible in preparations?
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:20.120]   And is she yielded to God?
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:28.460]   (congregation applauding)
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:32.460]   - After you.
[00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:36.300]   (congregation laughing)
[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:43.300]   - And hey, that's a fantasy girl.
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:47.100]   That last one, that's the most important one.
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:50.220]   You get that last one, that's the non-negotiable.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.780]   There's other things, those are good.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:53.940]   You take 'em, you get a little more, a little less,
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:54.940]   you're mixing up the smoothie,
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:56.580]   give me more of that, a little less of that.
[00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:59.860]   Those things, you know, you want her to be faithful, right?
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.660]   They're not all created equal, okay?
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:05.300]   You might be able to get by with her not being aesthete,
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:09.340]   right, but she needs to be yielded to God.
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:11.000]   And then to find someone yielded to God,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.700]   you need to be yielded to God, right?
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:15.540]   And that's the truth.
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:18.940]   It's funny, we just think about this all wrong.
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:20.580]   That guy was making that smoothie up there.
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:24.100]   I'm like, dude, I don't want anything to do with that, right?
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.060]   I'm out on that.
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.940]   He mixes it up and he pours me a little Dixie cup
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:29.660]   and hands 'em out to my kids and to me,
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:31.500]   and I'm like, I don't even want it.
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.700]   I'm like with my nine-year-old, she's like,
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:33.540]   I'm not drinking that.
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.020]   I'm like, I'm not either, I'm with you.
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.260]   (congregation laughing)
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:37.620]   And the guy's like, no, just taste it.
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:40.820]   And I tried it, I was like, oh my gosh, that's amazing.
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:43.260]   When did you sneak in like a pound of sugar or something?
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:45.020]   Like, what, it was incredible.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:46.320]   Like, all I saw you put in there
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.060]   was stuff that's good for me.
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:51.940]   And that's, like, you want her to be fun and attractive,
[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:56.180]   but if you go after the things that are good for marriage,
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:59.320]   the fun and the attractive is gonna come.
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:03.300]   It might surprise you, but if you go after the fun
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:06.740]   and attractive and chemistry as the top priority
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:08.700]   and you leave out those other things,
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.460]   it's gonna mess you up.
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:15.460]   Your marriage is gonna die before it started.
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:19.700]   And if you don't believe me, look behind you.
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:22.960]   Not literally behind you, I mean, like,
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.660]   look at your past dating life and what you valued
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:28.020]   and how did that work out.
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.860]   Guys, would you just consider if I'm right?
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:34.340]   Don't even stoop to consider if I'm right.
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:35.980]   Would you consider if he's right?
[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:40.260]   God loves you, he knows, he wants something from you.
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:42.540]   I'm not just saying, like, don't just hear me say,
[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:45.180]   hey, suck it up and eat your vegetables.
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:46.540]   That's not what I'm saying.
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:51.100]   I'm saying, hey, you start your list with what God values.
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:54.360]   If you do that, you're gonna be okay.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:59.180]   You're gonna be okay, guys, I know you're confused.
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.580]   I know you've believed lies,
[00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.580]   but guys, if you're well and you wanna get married,
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:07.940]   I can help you.
[00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:11.480]   I'd love to help you, let me pray.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:16.620]   Father, thank you for just loving us enough
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:18.640]   to even care about these little things,
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:22.940]   who we would partner with.
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:30.140]   God, as we consider the ingredients
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:32.240]   that we would seek out,
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:37.700]   would you just help us in our foolishness
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:40.340]   to love what you love,
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:42.940]   to long for what you long for,
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.100]   to seek what you seek out in us,
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:48.300]   really the things that you create in us, God,
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:49.940]   by the power of your Holy Spirit.
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:53.580]   You're the king of hearts.
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:55.580]   You direct them wherever you please.
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:59.300]   So Lord, would you be the king of our hearts
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.900]   and would you direct them to someone
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.740]   whose heart you already have
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:07.580]   and help us to live out your will?
[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:10.000]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
