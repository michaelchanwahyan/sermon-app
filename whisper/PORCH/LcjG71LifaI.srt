8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,940
 If you have a Bible, you can flip over to 1 Peter.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,760
 Hello, friends in the room,

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,740
 friends in Fort Worth, Houston,

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,940
 and all over who are joining with us.

12
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,940
 Let me read the passage that we will be in tonight

13
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,500
 as we continue 1 Peter,

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,160
 a letter from the apostle Peter,

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,200
 the leader of the disciples

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,580
 who had his life totally changed by Jesus,

17
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,380
 formerly known as Simon was Peter's name.

18
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,700
 And Jesus came along and said,

19
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,060
 "I'm gonna change your name to Rocky,

20
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,300
 "and you're about to change the world

21
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,260
 "with you and a whole bunch of other people."

22
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,620
 And so let me read one of the letters

23
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,220
 that he wrote to the church.

24
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,180
 And here's, Peter means Rocky, or Rock,

25
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,780
 in case you're like, "What is he talking about?"

26
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,300
 Here's where we're gonna be in chapter five,

27
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,400
 starting in verse one.

28
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,080
 Peter writes and says,

29
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,780
 "To the elders, the leaders among you,

30
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,820
 "I appeal to you as a fellow elder

31
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,360
 "and a witness of Christ's sufferings,

32
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,860
 "who will also share in the glory to be revealed.

33
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,180
 "Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care,

34
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,080
 "watching over them, not because you must,

35
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,680
 "but because you're willing, as God wants you to be,

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,220
 "not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve,

37
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,020
 "not lording it over those entrusted to you,

38
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,000
 "but being examples to the flock.

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,260
 "And when the chief shepherd, Jesus, appears,

40
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,380
 "you will receive the crown of glory

41
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,540
 "that will never fade away.

42
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,840
 "In the same way, you who are younger,

43
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,900
 "submit yourselves to your elders.

44
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,440
 "All of you, clothe yourselves in humility

45
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,060
 "towards one another, because God opposes the proud,

46
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,880
 "but shows favor to the humble.

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,780
 "Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand,

48
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,780
 "that he may lift you up in due time.

49
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,720
 "Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you."

50
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,200
 Let me pray one more time, we'll dive in.

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,140
 Father, thank you for your word, thank you

52
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,040
 that you take people like Simon Peter,

53
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,140
 who are broken, messed up people,

54
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,280
 and you allow them to step into a relationship with you

55
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,480
 and step out of wasting their life away

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,880
 and finding purpose and healing and hope,

57
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,680
 and finding you.

58
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,260
 Father, we pray that that would happen tonight,

59
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,420
 that you would open eyes for anyone

60
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,460
 who doesn't have a relationship,

61
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,620
 that you would open all of our eyes

62
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,620
 to just the truths contained in your word.

63
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,460
 You'd instruct our hearts, that you would allow

64
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,360
 just your word, which you say is sharper than anything,

65
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,140
 to pierce into our hearts, to pierce into this heart,

66
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:40,000
 mine and my friend's hearts, and to transform us

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,100
 and make us more like Jesus.

68
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,700
 Father, we love you, thank you for sending your son

69
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,360
 to die the death that we deserved,

70
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,660
 and allowing us, by his new life, to have lived a life

71
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,700
 that, apart from him, we could not live.

72
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,300
 In Jesus' name, amen.

73
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,460
 Well, I went to the University of Texas A&M.

74
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,300
 Any Aggies in this place?

75
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,940
 Oh my gosh, it's entirely Aggies.

76
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,480
 Hello, breakaway.

77
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,700
 So when I was at A&M, I did sports

78
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,700
 for the first couple years there.

79
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,680
 I did track, it was nothing impressive at all,

80
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,060
 and I threw the javelin, which like six people

81
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,220
 on the planet do, so it's like me and you six guys.

82
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,500
 And anyways, we had these sport advisors

83
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,420
 who would tell you or help you enroll you

84
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,540
 in the classes that you would take.

85
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,140
 Basically, everybody who was involved

86
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,260
 in the athletic program, especially for like football players

87
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,460
 or different people, are like, we're gonna make sure

88
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,480
 you take the easiest electives we have.

89
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,260
 So we're gonna go knitting on one,

90
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,540
 we're gonna go yoga class, and then agronomy

91
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,660
 was the one that I got handed.

92
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,780
 So I'm gonna start by telling you

93
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,340
 about my experience in agronomy.

94
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,140
 I know all you guys love agronomy.

95
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,120
 What is agronomy?

96
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,660
 The study of the stars?

97
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,940
 No, it's not that, that's astronomy.

98
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,500
 Agronomy is, it was agronomy 101,

99
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,320
 and I got told by my advisor, this is gonna be your elective

100
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,700
 for the first semester, he go, agronomy is the study,

101
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,180
 or it's recreational turf grass.

102
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,820
 Agronomy, yes, agricultural, Texas A&M,

103
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,460
 agriculture mechanical, and they had an agronomy class,

104
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,500
 and it was me and essentially the football team,

105
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,740
 and we're in there, and you are learning

106
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,540
 about how grass grows.

107
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,420
 So I am about to tell you what I learned

108
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,380
 over this entire semester in the next probably 35 seconds,

109
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,260
 and I'm gonna save you what I paid $3,000 for

110
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,060
 and give it to you right here.

111
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,660
 Basically, here's what you study.

112
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,540
 Hey, this is how grass grows, and these are the things

113
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,540
 that are essential and necessary,

114
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,900
 and the different types of grass, and how they can all grow.

115
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,460
 And there's four things that are necessary

116
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,340
 for any grass to grow.

117
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,980
 If grass, if you ever have it to grow,

118
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,800
 I'm about to save you.

119
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,300
 I know everyone came in here tonight being like,

120
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,700
 please, talk about the grass.

121
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,300
 And so I'm about to remove that and tell you,

122
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,340
 if grass is gonna grow, there's four things necessary.

123
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,860
 Sunlight, I know you can write this down.

124
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,460
 I see a lot of people.

125
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,460
 Water, soil, and you gotta pick the weeds.

126
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,820
 I'm gonna repeat them.

127
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,700
 Sunlight, water, soil, you gotta pick the weeds.

128
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,180
 I just saved you $3,000 right there.

129
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,180
 Yeah, you're welcome.

130
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,260
 Here's why I start with that.

131
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,580
 In order for, (laughs)

132
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,780
 yeah, thank you, that's great, yeah, clap.

133
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,540
 So in order for anything in this grass to grow,

134
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,220
 you had to have these four things, and that are essential.

135
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,700
 If they were not present, the grass would not grow.

136
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,900
 If there wasn't water, couldn't happen.

137
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,660
 If it was like in a closet, you couldn't grow grass.

138
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,620
 If you were trying to throw grass on concrete,

139
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,020
 it had to have soil, couldn't grow.

140
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,940
 If you didn't pick weeds, it would choke out the grass

141
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,220
 and it wouldn't grow.

142
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,480
 Why would I start there?

143
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,460
 No reason at all.

144
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,860
 I just had to get that off my chest

145
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,700
 and share it with somebody.

146
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,520
 I'm totally kidding.

147
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,020
 The reason I start there is because in the same way

148
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,700
 that there are four essentials that are required,

149
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,180
 are necessary in order for growth to take place,

150
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,060
 and grass is life.

151
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,260
 All of us came in here tonight, especially for Christians,

152
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,340
 if you're a Christ follower in the room,

153
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,620
 I'm talking especially to you,

154
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,620
 with a desire to grow, to grow spiritually.

155
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,220
 In other words, for Christ followers,

156
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,100
 there probably isn't very many or any of us

157
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,500
 who came in the room who's like, you know what?

158
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,300
 I feel like I've reached the pinnacle of my growth.

159
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,220
 I don't need to know any more Bible.

160
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,300
 I know all that I could possibly ever know

161
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,860
 or all that there is to know.

162
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,700
 My prayer life, it's like me and Mother Teresa

163
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,020
 are on the same playing field here.

164
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,020
 My service and my ministry impact,

165
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,500
 it eclipses anything else on this planet

166
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,300
 and like anything anyone has ever seen.

167
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,220
 The very few or none of us come in here feeling like,

168
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,900
 man, there's no spiritual ground for me to take.

169
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,020
 And if that is you, this message probably

170
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,300
 is not gonna be for you, so you're dismissed right now.

171
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,300
 But for the rest of us who came in saying,

172
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,580
 man, I want to grow, I want to experience

173
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,100
 spiritual growth in my life, that I do wanna see,

174
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,300
 I do wanna see my integrity grow,

175
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,420
 which happens whenever you spiritually grow

176
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,500
 and you grow more and more godly.

177
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,300
 I do wanna grow in my knowledge of God's word,

178
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,440
 I do wanna be better at relationships,

179
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,260
 which I know whenever I'm good at vertically

180
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,100
 I'm making sure that I love the Lord my God,

181
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,980
 that I become a better lover of my neighbor as myself.

182
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,160
 That we all came in here with this desire

183
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,900
 to spiritually take it on and spiritually grow.

184
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,580
 And just like in that agronomy class

185
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,820
 where we remove the mystery of,

186
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,420
 hey, these things are always present,

187
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,480
 if growth is gonna take place,

188
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,260
 there are certain things that Peter lays out

189
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,340
 in this passage that if you are going

190
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,180
 to experience spiritual growth,

191
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,660
 are essential in your life and in my life.

192
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,780
 Said otherwise, if the three things

193
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,340
 that we're gonna talk about are not present in your life,

194
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,380
 you will not spiritually grow.

195
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,260
 And you're gonna wake up however many months from today

196
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,640
 and you're gonna look back and wish

197
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,700
 that you had began to implement the stuff that Peter says,

198
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,020
 or you're gonna begin to apply them

199
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,060
 and begin to see and experience growth.

200
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,180
 It's not the exhaustive list of things,

201
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,420
 but if these are not present,

202
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,360
 just like sunlight with grass, you will not grow.

203
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,060
 And Peter gives us very clear instructions

204
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,020
 on what those things are gonna be.

205
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,100
 So we're gonna pick it up right where we stopped

206
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,000
 or right where we started at verse one of chapter five

207
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,900
 where Peter goes into his closing remarks to the church

208
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,340
 and we're gonna look at the three essentials

209
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,580
 that he lays out necessary for spiritual growth.

210
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,700
 He talks about submission to godly leadership,

211
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,400
 clothing ourselves in humility towards God

212
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,380
 and towards others or towards other believers,

213
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,000
 and then how we cast our anxiety, not carry it.

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,260
 So we're gonna look at those three ideas

215
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,620
 and the three things that he says are necessary

216
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,540
 if you and I are going to experience growth

217
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,380
 inside of our life.

218
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,980
 Let's pick it up back in verse one.

219
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,220
 So he begins writing to the elders.

220
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,220
 Elders is a word for pastor, leader.

221
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,620
 He's writing, as you know,

222
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,500
 a lot of the New Testament is letters.

223
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
 So if you have the New Testament,

224
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,700
 which is the second half of the Bible, part two,

225
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,300
 a lot of it is made up of letters

226
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,620
 that were written by the apostles, the disciples and Paul,

227
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,700
 and they wrote these letters.

228
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,060
 There's 21 letters out of the 27 books in the New Testament.

229
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,180
 21 of them are these letters written to churches

230
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,140
 who are made up of new believers going,

231
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,220
 "How do I live out this faith?"

232
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,620
 And Peter and a lot of the boys wrote these letters saying,

233
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,420
 "Hey, this is what it looks like to follow Jesus."

234
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,220
 So now he begins addressing the specific leaders

235
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,940
 of the church that he's writing to,

236
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,780
 and here's what he says.

237
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,660
 "To the elders, the leaders of this church,

238
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,940
 "among you, I appeal to you as a fellow elder

239
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,660
 "and a witness of Christ's sufferings,

240
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,140
 "who will also share in the glory to be revealed."

241
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,980
 Like, hey, I'm in this, we're in this together

242
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,260
 as leaders of the church.

243
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,420
 I'm telling you, be shepherds or care for God's flock

244
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,340
 that is under your care.

245
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,500
 "Watching over them, not because you must,"

246
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,620
 so he's talking to the leaders,

247
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,060
 here's how I want you to lead your church,

248
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,340
 "but because you're willing, as God wants you to be.

249
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,980
 "Not pursuing dishonest gain,"

250
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,180
 don't do this to make more money,

251
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,380
 to take advantage of people,

252
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,020
 "but being eager to serve."

253
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,120
 He gives the call and the commands of leadership

254
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,720
 inside of the church.

255
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,080
 "Not lording it over those who entrusted it to you,

256
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,860
 "but being an example that you lead by example to the flock.

257
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,220
 "And when the chief shepherd,"

258
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,140
 like, reminder, leader of the church,

259
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,700
 you have a leader, Jesus,

260
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,340
 "and when he appears, you will receive the crown of glory

261
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,980
 "that will never fade away,"

262
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,060
 that it's gonna be worth it.

263
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,540
 In the same way that there's something

264
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,580
 for the elders or the leaders of a church to do,

265
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,260
 elders is the local leadership of a church.

266
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,240
 In the same way, you who are younger,

267
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,300
 or you could insert, hey, you friends at the porch,

268
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,760
 or you who are younger inside of their church,

269
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,540
 there's specific things for you to do.

270
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,680
 Submit yourselves to the elders.

271
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,920
 The first essential that he gives us for spiritual growth,

272
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,200
 if you and I are gonna experience it,

273
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,960
 is that you and I are called to submit to God's leaders,

274
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,480
 called to submit to God's leaders.

275
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,040
 Now, here's what I know about you,

276
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,940
 'cause I know it's true about me,

277
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,600
 and it's really just true about millennials in general,

278
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,720
 probably just Americans,

279
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,720
 is like, submission in general and submission to authority

280
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,740
 are not a millennial's favorite word choice, if you will.

281
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,040
 Like, probably not a lot of us have like a tattoo

282
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,760
 that says submit to authority.

283
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,480
 It's just not something that we're really excited

284
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,560
 about doing around here,

285
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,080
 maybe 'cause there's been abuse of authority

286
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,240
 or different things that we've seen,

287
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,280
 but if you're a follower of Christ, this is not an option,

288
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,480
 that you and I, me too, are called to submit ourselves

289
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,580
 to a local church group

290
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,900
 and the leadership of that local church,

291
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,280
 that if you and I are gonna experience growth,

292
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,640
 the first idea is that you and I are called

293
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,740
 to submit to God's leaders.

294
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,640
 What do I mean by that?

295
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,920
 I do not mean that you're called to attend a church.

296
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,260
 I mean that you're called to be plugged in

297
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,260
 or a member of a church.

298
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,740
 If you attend here on a Tuesday,

299
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,440
 even if you attend on a Sunday, you're not a member.

300
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,880
 You're an attender.

301
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,200
 You and I are called to be members of a church,

302
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,720
 whether that's here or another place.

303
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,580
 If you're from another church, we're so glad you're here.

304
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,360
 We're not trying to church steal or anything.

305
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,940
 We hope you go deeper into wherever God has you,

306
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,380
 but all of us are called, if you're a Christ follower,

307
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,700
 to be members of a church.

308
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,100
 You and I are called to submit to a local leadership

309
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,000
 and be underneath the authority of elders around us,

310
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,720
 just like grass wouldn't grow in that scenario

311
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,800
 unless it's under sunlight.

312
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,600
 You will not grow unless you are under the authority

313
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,720
 of local leadership,

314
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,560
 unless you are underneath the authority

315
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,520
 of a local leadership.

316
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,600
 Man, I missed this for so many years of my life.

317
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,520
 I remember in college that there was never,

318
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,800
 I never plugged into a church.

319
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,140
 Like I would serve at different places,

320
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,640
 but I was disobedient to this passage,

321
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,620
 to many passages inside of the New Testament

322
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,360
 that teach that you and I are called

323
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,920
 to be a part of a local church.

324
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,400
 And there's an epidemic among millennials

325
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,440
 where they just church hop.

326
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,480
 Hey, you kinda go to the village on Sunday,

327
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,720
 you check out the porch on Tuesday,

328
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,560
 maybe go to IBC or PCBC

329
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,320
 or any of these different initials out here,

330
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,240
 and you kinda just check 'em out

331
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,040
 and they're kinda on the Rolodex and which one's up next.

332
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,080
 And then I podcast this person and I listen to this person,

333
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,800
 and the scripture says you're living disobedient

334
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,840
 to what Christ's command is on your life.

335
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,580
 Whether you're gonna plug in here or another place,

336
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,980
 if you are a Christian,

337
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,560
 you are called to be a part of a local church.

338
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,520
 I'm gonna say it again and I'm just gonna hammer it

339
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,320
 and then give an illustration and we're gonna move on.

340
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,520
 If you are not a member of a church,

341
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,520
 and you're a Christian,

342
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,240
 you're living in disobedience

343
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,040
 to the clear commands in scripture.

344
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,520
 And you may be hiding behind like some smoke screen,

345
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,640
 I'm trying to figure out my job,

346
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,760
 and maybe, you know, and I wanna make sure I get married

347
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,120
 'cause then, you know, my boo may have a different church.

348
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,540
 You're hiding behind a bunch of excuses.

349
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,160
 And God's command is that you become a member of a church.

350
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,520
 If it's not this one, there's lots of great ones,

351
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,440
 but we're all called to get plugged in.

352
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,800
 You will not grow if you're not connected to a local body.

353
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,840
 And on the flip side, what's amazing is how much people grow

354
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,980
 whenever they get plugged into a local church.

355
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,060
 Like I was talking to a buddy today

356
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,280
 who's one of our leaders,

357
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,720
 and we were hanging out a couple weekends ago

358
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,240
 at something called a porch leader retreat,

359
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,160
 which we do a couple times a year.

360
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,960
 We take the 10 or 12 leaders that lead the teams

361
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,800
 here at the porch.

362
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,640
 There's 200 volunteers,

363
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,560
 and they're over them at the Dallas campus.

364
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,600
 They're amazing men and women.

365
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,080
 And they, with our staff, just pull away,

366
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,160
 and we spend the weekend.

367
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,760
 And I was talking to one of the guys there,

368
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,680
 and we were talking randomly.

369
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,080
 He was sick, and we were talking about Advil,

370
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,820
 and he was going into, and I was reminded of his story

371
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,120
 because in the midst of the Advil, he was like,

372
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,240
 "Yeah, I try not to take too many Advil

373
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,860
 "because I feel like I hit it pretty hard

374
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,960
 "on the old liver there for a number of different years

375
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,080
 "when I was back in college,"

376
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,280
 referring to just his story

377
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,720
 and the ways that he wasn't pursuing Christ,

378
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,040
 but part of his past was just,

379
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,960
 "Man, I was living for the party scene."

380
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,480
 It was either sex, alcohol, drugs, whatever it was,

381
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,760
 until Christ captured his heart.

382
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,640
 And I asked him today,

383
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,480
 we were talking about some of his story,

384
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,880
 and he said, "Man, there were so many times

385
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,560
 "I would come down front,

386
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,200
 "and I would talk to someone down there,

387
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,100
 "and the same thing would happen every time.

388
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,600
 "I'd basically come down and confess,

389
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,300
 "and I'd be like, 'Yeah, I got wasted again this Friday.

390
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,440
 "'Yeah, I got wasted this Friday.'"

391
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,460
 And finally, JP, he told me,

392
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,680
 "Man, when are you gonna go all in?

393
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,820
 "If you want to stop playing the game

394
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,960
 "and experience change, go all in."

395
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,600
 And it was in that moment, or when he decided to do that,

396
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,160
 he submitted himself to a group of elders.

397
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,840
 He joined this church.

398
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,080
 And in submitting to the elders,

399
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,320
 you're like, "What does that mean here?

400
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,760
 "I'll give you what it means here."

401
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,420
 It means you follow the instructions

402
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,440
 that they have for the flock among you, or a flock here,

403
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,280
 not because they're like,

404
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,740
 "Oh, man, we need somebody to make us feel important

405
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,400
 "because they will stand before God

406
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,480
 "and give an account for the flock here."

407
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,840
 And some of the instructions they have

408
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,540
 is be in a community group, that you serve somewhere,

409
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,520
 that you have a annual kind of checkpoint with our staff

410
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,040
 to make sure, "How are we doing?"

411
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,620
 And annually, you agree, "Hey, I'm still in.

412
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,240
 "I still want to be a member here."

413
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,600
 And in doing that, that's what it looks like

414
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,720
 to submit to the authority of Watermark,

415
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,360
 to be a part of the elders' leadership here.

416
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,520
 And in doing that, his life began to change.

417
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,120
 Like, if you just do that,

418
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,920
 if you just do that one thing,

419
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,860
 you're gonna experience growth because everything else,

420
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,700
 like, if you're connected,

421
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,460
 if you go all in at a healthy church under godly leadership,

422
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,500
 you're gonna grow in your Bible knowledge.

423
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,980
 You're gonna grow in your ability to talk about your faith.

424
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,620
 You're gonna grow in the peace that you have over anxiety.

425
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,840
 Maybe not overnight,

426
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,940
 but by submitting to the care of the elders here,

427
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,740
 you're gonna step into being known by other people.

428
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,380
 You're gonna step into using your gifts,

429
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,180
 not just consuming all the time, but contributing.

430
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,860
 And you're gonna experience growth in your life.

431
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,980
 And if you don't wanna grow,

432
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,000
 if you're like, man, I do not want to grow at all spiritually,

433
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,360
 my goal is to maybe move a little bit backwards,

434
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,000
 the thing you have got to avoid, like the plague,

435
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,660
 is becoming a member of a church.

436
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,160
 And even if you're not avoiding it like the plague,

437
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,280
 but you're just avoiding it in general,

438
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,960
 you are not going to grow

439
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,240
 if you don't submit to God's leadership

440
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,940
 inside of a local church.

441
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,420
 Peter continues and tells us something else

442
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,480
 related to just that idea of humility or submitting.

443
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,240
 He says this in second half verse five.

444
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,780
 All of you, so now we talked about elders, young people,

445
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,100
 everybody, clothe yourselves with humility

446
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,740
 towards one another,

447
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,280
 because God opposes the proud,

448
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,580
 but he shows favor to the humble.

449
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,360
 Humble yourselves therefore under God's mighty hand

450
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,760
 that he may lift you up in due time.

451
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,220
 That Peter says that you and I are every single day,

452
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,240
 if you're a Christian,

453
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,920
 you are to clothe yourselves in humility.

454
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,160
 Our second idea from the text

455
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,040
 is that we are to clothe ourselves in humility

456
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,920
 towards God's people and God's timing.

457
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,060
 I'll explain what I mean by that.

458
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,640
 But he basically says, hey, every single day,

459
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,520
 just like he uses the verb that just means tie around you,

460
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,360
 or to tie it on, that every day you wake up

461
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,800
 and just like you put on clothes,

462
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,500
 you put on humility as you look at your day.

463
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,300
 Very few of us probably have ever left the house

464
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,720
 without clothes and been like, oh my gosh,

465
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
 can't believe I forgot to put on clothes, gotta go back.

466
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,000
 In the same way, Peter would say, hey,

467
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,560
 you are to not leave the house every single day,

468
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,360
 put on, just like you put on clothes,

469
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,640
 put on humility towards one another

470
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,200
 and the way that you interact with one another

471
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,820
 and the way that you are humble towards God

472
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,280
 and his timing in your life.

473
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,000
 And I think a lot of times humility can be misunderstood.

474
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,640
 And as you've, if you've been with us,

475
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,640
 heard us say before, an old C.S. Lewis quote,

476
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,040
 which is just a Christian writer,

477
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,320
 that humility is not thinking about yourself

478
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,300
 or thinking less of yourself, like, man, I just hate me,

479
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,800
 or thinking more of yourself.

480
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,960
 It's thinking about yourself less.

481
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,160
 It's not thinking less of yourself, like, man, I hate me

482
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,640
 and I'm just so ugly and gosh, I'm not,

483
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,800
 I don't deserve anything.

484
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,620
 It's not thinking about yourself.

485
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,920
 The focus of your life is not on how bad you are,

486
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,600
 how good you are, but just on others around you

487
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,240
 and the God that you serve.

488
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,800
 And Peter says every single day,

489
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,080
 the posture of a Christian is to be one

490
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,400
 of being considerate towards other,

491
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,880
 of being humble towards others, humble towards God,

492
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,000
 which we'll talk about in a second.

493
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,800
 But what does it look like to be humble towards others?

494
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,480
 It looks like being considerate of the needs

495
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,040
 of other people around you.

496
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,040
 It looks like being caring and serving

497
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,980
 other people around you, rather than seeking to be served,

498
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,400
 not to get, you know, praised as the servant,

499
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,960
 but just because you see people as who they are,

500
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,960
 made in God's image, the same God that you serve.

501
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,080
 And Peter says, put this on every single day

502
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,280
 when you get up, seek to serve others around you.

503
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,720
 The crazy thing about humility is like,

504
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,660
 humility looks good on everyone.

505
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,580
 Like there's not a person in the room

506
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,820
 who if you are humble, are not gonna be more attractive.

507
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,220
 Like if you can just learn to have a true,

508
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,620
 sincere posture of humility, if you're a person

509
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,580
 who's like, man, I'm not quick to like celebrate myself

510
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,420
 and how great I am and you know, me, me, me, me, me,

511
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,960
 enough about me, now you talk about me.

512
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,540
 If you're not that person, but you're someone

513
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,740
 who's like, man, I'm quick to praise others,

514
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,620
 I'm quick to acknowledge just how much of my life

515
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,820
 is a gift from God and anything that's good there,

516
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,260
 I've really been so fortunate.

517
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,520
 Like that person is so attractive.

518
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,340
 The person who seeks to serve,

519
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,620
 the person who out of humility is like grateful

520
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,540
 for things in their life 'cause they're not entitled.

521
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,460
 The person who's out of humility, like not easily offended,

522
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,740
 they're quick to forgive.

523
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,260
 Like you see, ever seen conflict between humble people?

524
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,660
 It's like the most boring thing ever.

525
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,260
 It's like, man, I'm so sorry.

526
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,700
 No, no, are you serious?

527
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,540
 No, this was me.

528
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,180
 Are you, no, no, it was mainly me.

529
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,100
 And it's like, oh my gosh, guys, seriously.

530
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,340
 You don't conflict much.

531
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,620
 Humility is one of those things

532
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,460
 that makes life better and makes anyone who has it better.

533
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,840
 I mean, true story, fellas,

534
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,240
 if you've been hit with the ugly stick,

535
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,400
 I can tell you one thing.

536
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,480
 You will be more attractive to the ladies in this room

537
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,040
 if you are humble.

538
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
 (laughing)

539
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,880
 It's true.

540
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,360
 Somebody told me this last week.

541
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,200
 Dude, you got a face made for radio.

542
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,880
 I was like, you're a mean, mean person.

543
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,840
 That'll click.

544
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,120
 And if you got a face made for radio,

545
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,160
 I am confident you will be more attractive,

546
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,460
 you will be a more potential suitor

547
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,480
 if you can learn the art of humility

548
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,780
 that overflows from your relationship and love from Christ.

549
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,500
 Just that's for free, okay?

550
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,960
 You can take that to the bank.

551
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,080
 But it's true, it's the little black dress.

552
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,560
 It looks good on everybody, regardless of who's wearing it.

553
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,020
 Humility, it looks good every single time.

554
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,200
 Ugly stick is not in my notes, I apologize.

555
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,040
 (laughing)

556
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,800
 Let's just save the email.

557
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,820
 And we're moving on.

558
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,600
 And then he talks about not only humility towards others,

559
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,760
 but humility towards God's timing.

560
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,240
 Come back with me.

561
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,520
 That humility doesn't just look like humility towards others,

562
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,200
 but humility and trusting of God's timing.

563
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,560
 Or one of the ways humility manifests itself

564
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,360
 is by trusting in God's timing inside of your life.

565
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,280
 But what does he say?

566
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,600
 He says at the end of verse that God,

567
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,820
 by when we humble ourselves underneath his mighty hand,

568
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:13,860
 we trust and allow him to exalt him in due time.

569
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,800
 That part of humility is trusting,

570
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,040
 like God, you're in control.

571
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
 I'm gonna trust your timing inside of my life.

572
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,320
 How much of young adulthood is spent not trusting

573
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,240
 or fighting against God for the timing

574
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,440
 that you don't think is playing out the way you want it to?

575
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,040
 I can speak from experience in my own life.

576
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,080
 I mean, so much of my own struggles with humility

577
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,680
 are clearly going, God, when am I gonna move further

578
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,520
 down the road?

579
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,680
 I should be farther in my career.

580
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,640
 I should make more money by now.

581
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,540
 Maybe for you, it's like, hey,

582
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,320
 I should have been married already.

583
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,880
 God, what are you doing?

584
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,960
 I should have, my biological clock is running out, God.

585
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,400
 Are you gonna do something?

586
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,920
 Am I gonna get a promotion?

587
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,320
 Am I ever gonna own a home?

588
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,280
 Where am I gonna live once my roommate lives?

589
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,880
 And so much of humility is just saying,

590
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,040
 God, I'm gonna trust that you're in control.

591
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,460
 I'm gonna trust your timing.

592
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,720
 It's the word that Peter uses.

593
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,480
 That you would trust humility

594
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640
 is trusting the God who's in control,

595
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,400
 who's moving the circumstances around.

596
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,720
 That he's over my life

597
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,960
 and he's the one ultimately who's in control.

598
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,280
 This one is probably easily the one that like,

599
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,100
 I wrestle with to a point where I don't even feel

600
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,880
 like I can truly preach it with integrity.

601
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,760
 So I'll just say, man, I stink at this.

602
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,800
 Join the crowd.

603
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,920
 And I was with JP and Garrett who leads it in Fort Worth

604
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,920
 and we were doing a teaching retreat a couple months ago.

605
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,160
 And we were planning out the year

606
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,920
 and we break away, go to somewhere,

607
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,560
 whether it's a lake house

608
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,520
 or just a place of friends connection.

609
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,720
 And we try to get away and plan out the year

610
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,880
 of the sermons and the series.

611
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,560
 And throughout that time,

612
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,120
 I just remember dialoguing and going,

613
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,880
 man, sometimes I feel like, oftentimes I feel like,

614
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,740
 I'm like, I don't know if I should even stay in ministry.

615
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,160
 I feel like I should be further down.

616
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,040
 Maybe I should go lead a church like God.

617
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,480
 I feel like, and I can immediately go,

618
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,720
 man, maybe I need to go into the business world

619
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,800
 or I should be elevated further along

620
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,040
 in my career path by now.

621
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,500
 I should be making more money.

622
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,040
 I should have a bigger house

623
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,920
 or whatever the different accomplishments.

624
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,240
 And it's a pride that wells up in me

625
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,080
 that I would call, man, it's just discontentment

626
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,820
 and it's pride and it's evil and it's wicked.

627
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,480
 And it's the thing that brings the opposition of God.

628
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,440
 And Peter says, man, trust the God who's in the heavens.

629
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,040
 You can trust his timing over your life.

630
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,300
 You can voice and express the things

631
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,400
 that, man, you're disappointed.

632
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,360
 You can be honest with God, but at the same time,

633
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,600
 humble yourselves and say, I'm gonna choose God.

634
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,160
 I trust your timing.

635
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,160
 I can be honest in asking you

636
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,080
 to bring about certain things in my life,

637
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,640
 but I'm gonna trust your timing above my own.

638
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,360
 And Peter says, man, clothe yourself in humility

639
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,840
 and you'll experience growth.

640
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,920
 Humility towards others, humility towards God.

641
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,540
 And then he finishes and really connects

642
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,040
 to the idea of humility and so much of our future

643
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,880
 and the ways that we don't trust God's timing,

644
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,000
 which is called anxiety.

645
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,200
 And here's what he says.

646
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,160
 Cast all your anxiety, or casting,

647
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,480
 it's a continuation, it's the same sentence.

648
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,000
 And in the Greek, that word cast is casting.

649
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,160
 So casting all, one of the ways we humble ourself

650
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,600
 is by casting all of our anxiety on him

651
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,400
 because he cares for you.

652
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,800
 That just like in that lawn scenario,

653
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,080
 there were certain things required in order for it to go.

654
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,360
 One of them was picking the weeds out.

655
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,120
 That in order for your, I'm sorry,

656
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,640
 in order for the grass to grow,

657
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,160
 that weeds had to be picked up and plucked and removed

658
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,520
 or they would choke out the grass.

659
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,580
 And the same way as it relates to anxiety

660
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,480
 inside of your life.

661
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,900
 The Bible doesn't say, hey, you'll never have anxiety ever.

662
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,380
 It says, hey, when you are anxious,

663
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,220
 there's something specific that you're to do.

664
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,120
 Just like pulling weeds out so that the grass can grow,

665
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,280
 you and I are to cast out anxieties

666
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,720
 so that the faith that we have can continue to grow.

667
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,240
 Casting them to a very specific place.

668
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,400
 Our third idea from the text is just,

669
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,960
 we cast your anxieties, don't carry them.

670
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,320
 You cast anxieties, you do not carry them.

671
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,680
 If you want your faith to grow,

672
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,520
 you cast your anxieties on the Lord,

673
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,960
 you do not carry them, Peter says.

674
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,280
 Peter, like a fisherman who was very familiar

675
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,660
 with casting things or casting in our day,

676
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,520
 casting a net out, says you and I are called

677
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,880
 not to carry anxieties around,

678
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,720
 but to cast them on the Lord,

679
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,080
 surrender them and bring them to him.

680
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,760
 Said another way that when I'm anxious,

681
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,720
 God wants me to, his word tells me to,

682
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,960
 bring to him the things I'm anxious about.

683
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,400
 Bring to him through prayer.

684
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,520
 God, you know what I'm facing today.

685
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,480
 You know the interview that I had.

686
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,120
 You know that if this job doesn't work out,

687
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,040
 that I don't know what I'm gonna do.

688
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,720
 God, you know that I'm so tired of being single

689
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,640
 and I'm really hoping that something's gonna change.

690
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,160
 God, you know that I'm not sure where I'm gonna live

691
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,000
 'cause my roommate's about to move out.

692
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,660
 And you know that as I sit here, I'm anxious, Lord.

693
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,120
 Will you help me to trust you?

694
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,840
 And Father, will you change this?

695
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,880
 He says, bring your anxieties for a very specific reason,

696
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,540
 because he cares for you.

697
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,200
 And that little word care is a word

698
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,880
 that's almost stronger than the English word care.

699
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,260
 It means you matter to God.

700
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,260
 Not like you matter to God, but you matter to God.

701
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,360
 Some of you, the most important thing

702
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,640
 you're gonna leave here with,

703
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,920
 especially if anxiety's a part of your story

704
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,160
 or part of your struggle,

705
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:30,420
 is knowing that God cares about you.

706
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,140
 He cares about the things you're wrestling with.

707
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,300
 He cares about the things that are making you anxious.

708
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,880
 He cares about what's on your schedule tomorrow,

709
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,900
 that the God of the universe cares about you.

710
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,360
 He cares enough to send his son to die for you.

711
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,140
 Do you not think that he cares about the fact

712
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,700
 that your mom has cancer?

713
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,300
 And Peter says, cast all your anxieties on him.

714
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,140
 He cares you.

715
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,900
 When you get anxious, so much of our tendency

716
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,460
 is to hold onto it ourself

717
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,420
 and try to carry it ourself.

718
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,920
 Peter says, you're not strong enough to carry it.

719
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,580
 The God of the universe is saying,

720
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,580
 bring your anxieties to me.

721
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,060
 Why, because I won't know about 'em unless you do?

722
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,620
 No, I'm God, I know everything,

723
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,560
 but the reality is your heart and yourself

724
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,140
 will begin to change if the reaction to the struggles,

725
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,560
 the problems, the fears that you face in life

726
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,920
 goes from, I'm just gonna hold on to this,

727
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,340
 I'm gonna turn it, to going, God,

728
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,820
 you know what I'm facing, I'm gonna turn it,

729
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,260
 I'm gonna give this to you.

730
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,700
 Will you help me right now?

731
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,060
 And Peter says, when you do that,

732
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,580
 you cast out anxiety and your faith begins to grow.

733
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,860
 You're not strong enough to carry it.

734
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,140
 My son is, I have a 17-month-old son

735
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,620
 who's in this stage right now where everything,

736
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,820
 he wants to pick up everything and carry it around.

737
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,900
 He refuses to ask for help for anything,

738
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,940
 so he just goes around,

739
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,300
 and not only does he want to pick everything up,

740
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,140
 he goes ballistic whenever he doesn't get to pick it up,

741
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,620
 'cause we're terrible parents, apparently.

742
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,140
 And so he will go around

743
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,540
 and he'll try to pick up different things.

744
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,580
 I'm like, buddy, you can't pick that up,

745
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,420
 and then he'll just lose it.

746
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,100
 It's like, hey, buddy, you can't pick up the dog.

747
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,140
 He weighs four times as much as you do.

748
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,380
 And he'll just go ballistic.

749
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,620
 Last night, we were trying to get out the door

750
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,900
 to this banquet that we were going to,

751
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,060
 and the babysitter, we had a new babysitter showing up,

752
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,660
 and we're going, and we're getting everything ready,

753
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,860
 and our son is kinda outside playing,

754
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,740
 and he's trying to pick up this toy that he has

755
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,100
 that's way too heavy, and so I go and I grab him,

756
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,780
 and he just begins to lose it.

757
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,980
 And the babysitter's right here for the very first time,

758
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,660
 I'm like, hey, everything's fine, it's gonna be great.

759
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,500
 You're gonna love this kid.

760
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,660
 (audience laughing)

761
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,900
 And I'm like, man, buddy, just let me carry it.

762
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,660
 You're not strong enough.

763
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:35,360
 Peter says that whatever you're facing,

764
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,260
 and man, I have such compassion for anxiety.

765
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,120
 My wife, it's very a part of her story,

766
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,420
 and she's seen incredible victory,

767
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,940
 but I know for a lot of us in the room,

768
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:54,260
 anxiety can just be something that owns and grips us.

769
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,780
 And Peter says whatever you're facing,

770
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,820
 you're not strong enough to hold onto it.

771
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,480
 You're not strong enough to carry it,

772
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,940
 but there is one who is, will you bring it to him?

773
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,340
 And in doing so, you cast out the anxiety,

774
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,380
 and even then, you're declaring,

775
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,060
 God, I trust you, and your faith will grow.

776
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,620
 That God, in the moments where I'm tempted to despair

777
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,940
 'cause I don't know what I'm gonna do about my job,

778
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,900
 I don't know who I'm gonna marry,

779
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,880
 I'm just overwhelmed, I'm anxious right now,

780
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,500
 I'm not even sure why I'm anxious,

781
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,380
 but God, you know, and you're in control, I trust you.

782
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,140
 I don't know what tomorrow holds.

783
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,580
 I know that you hold tomorrow.

784
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,580
 You hold all things, and I'm gonna bring those to you,

785
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,620
 and even in that, you're showing your faith,

786
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,780
 you're flexing your faith.

787
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,500
 Peter says don't carry your anxieties,

788
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,060
 cast them off to the God who cares for you.

789
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,180
 Here's what's so crazy about anxiety,

790
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:50,780
 is it will choke your faith.

791
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:56,420
 Like only one of anxiety or faith can grow at the same time.

792
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,580
 Jesus, in Matthew 13, even says this,

793
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,460
 that hey, if you want your faith to get choked out

794
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,500
 or to not grow, if you allow anxiety around it,

795
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,760
 we'll choke that out.

796
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,140
 And further, what's interesting,

797
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,940
 is that anxiety, stay with me,

798
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:21,940
 anxiety and faith require the same soil to grow in,

799
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,760
 uncertainty.

800
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,420
 Like in other words, you cannot have faith

801
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,640
 without uncertainty,

802
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,040
 'cause that's just called seeing or sight.

803
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,900
 You cannot have faith without uncertainty,

804
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,680
 you cannot have anxiety without uncertainty.

805
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,460
 The very same circumstances

806
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,220
 under which anxiety shows up and flares up

807
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,980
 is the very same circumstances

808
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,740
 where faith shows up, uncertainty.

809
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,800
 Why does that matter?

810
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,940
 Oh, that's an interesting observation,

811
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,100
 because here's what it means.

812
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,860
 The very same circumstances today,

813
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,780
 if you were anxious today,

814
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,100
 if anxiety is a part of your story,

815
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,060
 if anxiety is something that you wrestle with,

816
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,660
 the very same things that cause anxiety in your life

817
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:05,820
 are the places that God wants to lead

818
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,620
 and grow your faith to,

819
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,620
 so that a moment where you normally get anxious,

820
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,760
 faith shows up.

821
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,840
 The very same circumstances, I'm on the plane,

822
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,160
 the plane starts going down,

823
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,560
 in a moment where I normally would be like,

824
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,120
 oh my gosh, I'm gonna lose it,

825
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,520
 all of a sudden I'm filled with faith,

826
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,000
 my God is in control.

827
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,060
 And that's an extreme one,

828
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,240
 maybe for more that hits at home,

829
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,880
 the very same moments where you're at work or your job,

830
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,280
 or you're not sure what's gonna happen

831
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,160
 in the midst of your family,

832
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,200
 maybe they're divorcing,

833
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,540
 where anxiety wells up,

834
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,520
 those are the moments

835
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,200
 that God, if you will let him lead you there,

836
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,120
 wants to eventually bring you to a place

837
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,040
 where instead of anxiety showing up in uncertainty,

838
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,840
 faith shows up,

839
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,480
 because it's the same places that they grow,

840
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,460
 uncertainty,

841
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,760
 and the God who is there wants to grow them in your life,

842
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,120
 he does not want you to carry anxiety,

843
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,760
 he wants you to cast them on him.

844
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,800
 Inside of this room, there's gonna be two stories,

845
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,300
 I'm gonna land the plane here.

846
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,720
 There's two paths that people are gonna come in,

847
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
 for Christians in the room,

848
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,480
 there's those of us who would come in

849
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,840
 and you're not a member of a church,

850
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,520
 you're not gonna get plugged into a church,

851
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,920
 you're gonna leave here and kind of continue jumping around

852
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,800
 and attending different places,

853
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,320
 but you will never submit to authority.

854
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,680
 You're not gonna clothe yourselves in humility,

855
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,200
 and listen to others and be subject to elders,

856
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,320
 and you're in the face of anxiety,

857
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,760
 you're not gonna turn to God,

858
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,360
 and your faith is not gonna grow, it's gonna die,

859
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,200
 or it's gonna be frozen from where you are now,

860
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,440
 until when you decide to do those things.

861
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,760
 And then there's others,

862
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,760
 who would decide or have already decided,

863
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,440
 I'm gonna submit myself to elders,

864
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,500
 I'm gonna step under the leadership of a church,

865
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,840
 because the church is perfect,

866
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,840
 no, there's no such thing as a perfect church,

867
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,120
 but because it's part of God's plan

868
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,080
 for me experiencing growth,

869
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,700
 and it's a command,

870
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,400
 and I'm gonna seek to be humble every day,

871
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,400
 put on humility, to allow others to speak into my life,

872
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,320
 to listen, be slow to speak, do whatever I can,

873
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,520
 be humble towards other believers and others in general,

874
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,640
 and humble towards my God,

875
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,640
 that God, I'm gonna choose to trust you,

876
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,440
 and there's gonna be moments where I don't want to,

877
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,320
 but I'm gonna choose to voice, God, I don't want to,

878
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,360
 will you help me trust you, and trust your timing,

879
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,480
 and I'm gonna bring my anxieties when they well up,

880
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,240
 I'm gonna bring them to you,

881
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,840
 not just hold onto them,

882
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,720
 but bring them to the God who says, I care for you,

883
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,040
 will you cast them on me, I'm strong enough.

884
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:52,160
 In that class, we would go and you'd see grass,

885
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,360
 and you would try to evaluate,

886
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,920
 or you would be a part of the class,

887
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,960
 was evaluating like, hey,

888
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,160
 which of the four essentials was not present

889
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,920
 that led to the grass not growing, if it was dead?

890
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,440
 So you're like, was it water, was it this?

891
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,460
 And you do an assessment, if you will.

892
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:13,200
 Inside of the room, the spiritual assessment,

893
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,400
 Peter puts before us,

894
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,040
 in that if you're gonna experience growth,

895
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,800
 you've gotta examine, it's going, hey,

896
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,120
 and you can like go, I'm not taking your assessment, great,

897
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,420
 well, I'll just put the questions out there.

898
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,640
 Are you a part of a local church?

899
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,800
 Are you underneath the authority of elders,

900
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,360
 who will stand before God, and give an account for you?

901
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,500
 Are you seeking to clothe yourselves in humility,

902
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,440
 with other believers, allowing them to speak in your life,

903
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,880
 serving and using the gifts God's given you,

904
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,020
 to walk humbly?

905
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,240
 Are you seeking to trust his timing,

906
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,280
 and casting your anxieties on him?

907
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,560
 If you're not, you're not gonna grow,

908
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,120
 and your faith will freeze,

909
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,320
 and you'll look back to this moment,

910
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,420
 and either wish you would have started,

911
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,400
 what hopefully someday you will,

912
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,280
 or you'll look back, and say, man, I kept going,

913
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,480
 I was doing those things, and I kept going,

914
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,800
 and my faith has strengthened and grown,

915
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,480
 and in the face of uncertainty,

916
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,360
 I have a God who I follow, and I cast my anxieties on.

917
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,960
 Let me pray.

918
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,920
 Father, thank you.

919
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,520
 God, that you care for us.

920
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,680
 Would that truth alone, if nothing else,

921
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,080
 seep in the hearts of maybe our friends in here,

922
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,960
 who don't have a relationship with you,

923
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,840
 who are not sure where they stand with you.

924
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,920
 Would they know that the God who sits in heaven,

925
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,920
 when he looks down, doesn't see them,

926
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,100
 and think, when are you gonna get it together,

927
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,800
 but feels compassion and care towards them,

928
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,900
 and longs to know him,

929
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,400
 longs not for them to try to work their way,

930
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,320
 or do something for them,

931
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,320
 but trust in what you've done for them,

932
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,360
 by dying in their place.

933
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,000
 Father, would you take ground in those of us

934
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,040
 who have anxiety, just as a part of our current reality,

935
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,080
 or just as a part of our wiring, or whatever it is,

936
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,960
 Lord, would you help us to trust in you,

937
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,760
 would we take things to you, and surrender those things,

938
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,240
 and find your peace and your grace sufficient,

939
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,520
 your powers made perfect in weakness,

940
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
 and Father, where we are weak,

941
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,560
 would you be strong as you promise you are.

942
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,660
 Father, would my friends who are not submitted

943
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,660
 to the authority of the church,

944
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,820
 as they claim the name of Christ,

945
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,820
 would the spirit of God press hard on their hearts right now,

946
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,780
 and move them quickly to join and be a part

947
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,560
 of being the church,

948
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,020
 and being a part of just your design,

949
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,300
 for which we would be cared for.

950
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,780
 Thank you that you have sent the chief shepherd,

951
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,100
 our savior Jesus, to die in our place,

952
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,120
 and you call out to all of us to come,

953
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,840
 experience your love, your care,

954
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,800
 and to come to the altar of the God who lives.

955
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,660
 We worship you now in song, amen.
