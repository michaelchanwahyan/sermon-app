[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:27.520]   All right, all right.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.880]   How we doing tonight?
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.280]   Come on.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.560]   Oh, we can do better than that.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.480]   Let's go, porch.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.360]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.840]   There we go.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.680]   Hey, I want to welcome you to the porch.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.560]   My name is Josiah.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.480]   I have the privilege of serving on staff here.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.480]   And man, let me just give a warm welcome to our Porch Live
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.600]   locations that are watching.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.560]   Porch Live Tulsa, Porch Live Boise, Scottsdale, Des Moines,
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.560]   Midland, Texas, and for the very first time,
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.760]   the Porch Live Doralstown, Pennsylvania.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.800]   Y'all give it up.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.720]   And my friends right here in Dallas, Texas, welcome.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.840]   Anybody have a good 4th of July?
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.760]   Yeah?
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.120]   Man, I missed y'all.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.240]   Like, this is one of my favorite times of the week
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.520]   to gather in this place.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.280]   And last week was the 4th.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.120]   So my family and I, we got away to East Texas.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.920]   And we went on a little lake house vacation.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.840]   And here's my crew.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.240]   Hopefully-- yep, there they are.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.240]   That's my wife, Kathy, with my best man in my wedding, Joe,
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.000]   and his wife, Haley, and their kids.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.240]   But then I got my oldest.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.960]   She's over here doing a little hip thing.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.960]   That's Camille.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.720]   And then I got--
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.720]   I don't know how I came up with the blonde hair, blue eye.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.640]   She's in the middle.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.440]   She's kind of lost.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.720]   She don't know what she's kind of doing.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.160]   But she's doing her thing.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.280]   She got the one recessive gene in the family.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.520]   I'm not sure how she got all that blonde hair.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.840]   But she did.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.760]   And then I have the little man, Astros jersey.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.880]   This is-- yeah.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.760]   You just mean mugging.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.520]   That's Caleb.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.960]   And I'm like, bro, we're just trying
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.240]   to take a family pic-- 4th of July for the 'Gram,
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.400]   you know what I'm saying?
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.920]   And he couldn't smile.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.720]   But that's my crew.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.840]   About four years ago, to this month to be specific,
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.920]   my family and I moved from Kansas City to Dallas
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.480]   to come on staff here at Watermark
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.560]   and be a part of what God's doing here at the porch.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.960]   And when we got to Dallas, we couldn't find a house.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.800]   So we were homeless.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.200]   Not really.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.580]   We were living with some friends.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.280]   But we were homeless for many months
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.600]   and trying to go from one house to another, just whoever
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.680]   would take us.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.120]   And I get a phone call from my wife.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.200]   And she said, Josiah, I found the house.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.480]   And I'm like, OK.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.340]   Send me a link.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.440]   And she said, no, just jump in the car with me.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.040]   We're going to go see the house.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.880]   And I'm like, I know what that means.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.280]   Because what you don't know, she's an interior designer.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.800]   So she sees things that I don't see.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   She sees potential in things.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.520]   She can beautify stuff that I can't.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.760]   But I've already gone down this road with her before.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.040]   So this is a red flag.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.560]   Because in Kansas City, we bought a house.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.240]   And we did the whole fixer upper thing.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.720]   And I'm no Chip, OK?
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.560]   I'm not.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.800]   She might be Joanna.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.880]   But I'm far from Chip.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.600]   I can demo.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.640]   But I kind of mess things up even when I demo.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.640]   I'm pretty good at cleaning things up.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.120]   But that's about it.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.520]   And so we pull up to this house.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.320]   And I'm like, oh, no.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.880]   No.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.880]   This is not-- I don't know if the Lord gave you a word
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.560]   or he made it clear.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.840]   This is just not the house.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.680]   Like, the brick is orange, y'all.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.880]   And when the sunlight hits it just right,
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.520]   it's like light pink.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.360]   And I'm like, no.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.400]   This is not the house.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.880]   There's not a blade of grass in the yard.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.360]   Like, it's all weeds.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.840]   OK, I'm kind of a grass person.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.920]   It's therapeutic for me.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.080]   And then we go into the house.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.840]   And I'm like, this whole thing needs to be gutted.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.760]   This is a big project, y'all.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.080]   Look at these bathrooms.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.360]   I think we got a picture of the bathrooms.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.240]   Oh.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.400]   Oh.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.640]   Yeah, you feel my pain.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.520]   Next one.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.840]   I mean, this house is old.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.280]   I mean, this is 1950s old.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.160]   And I'm just like, this can't be happening.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.600]   And so we start to process it.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.720]   And I'm just cynical.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.600]   I'm just being honest.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.120]   Not the best way to be in your marriage.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.160]   But I'm just confessing.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.120]   This is a safe place.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.440]   Don't look at me like you're crazy.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.800]   Come on, you guys got your own thing.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.640]   I might be cynical.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.200]   And I might be judgmental at times with my wife
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.400]   and what she wants.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.760]   But I'm cynical, man.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.840]   I'm calling out everything I see in this house.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.800]   So we bite.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.280]   We bite the bullet.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.920]   She talks me into it.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.720]   And we think, hey, three to six months of remodel.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.000]   And three months came and went.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.080]   Six months came and went.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.960]   And you know when your expectations don't really
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.840]   meet reality?
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.800]   You ever been there before?
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.640]   And you're just like, no, this is not what I had in mind.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.880]   And candidly, over three years of now living in the house,
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.080]   we're still remodeling it in some way.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.600]   And I start there tonight because I
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.120]   think sometimes this is how we feel about God.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.560]   We say things like, God, I'm going
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.280]   to give you a certain amount of time
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.600]   to beautify this thing in my life that's really ugly.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.800]   God, I don't really like what I see you doing.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.240]   I don't really appreciate what I'm having to go through.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.240]   I don't appreciate, hey, this job that I'm working at,
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.360]   it's my fourth job.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.200]   And I'm 30.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.720]   And I thought I was going to get the raise and the promotion.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.560]   And it didn't happen.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.320]   And I'm still sitting in debt.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.920]   And these expectations aren't meeting reality.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.640]   Maybe for you, you're single and 30.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.360]   That's my story.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.080]   Holler at your boy.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.480]   Just like sitting in my 30s.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.800]   And I'm like, God, you can show up anytime.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.840]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.920]   I'm waiting.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.640]   And I had the mentality like, I'm following you, God.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.520]   Like, I'm in my Bible.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.120]   Yeah, like we're getting in God's word.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.440]   And I'm memorizing scripture.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.040]   And I got community.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.200]   And I'm serving.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.160]   Lord, I'm serving.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.040]   And you know this, Lord, I'm giving money.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.240]   Like I'm giving the 10% off the top to the church
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.080]   and to other ministries.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.640]   God, you've got to be showing up for me.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.240]   And your expectations aren't necessarily meeting reality.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.480]   Maybe it's a strange relationship.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.480]   And this relationship isn't being reconciled.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.480]   Maybe a loved one just found out they had cancer.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:36.360]   Maybe it's a death in your family.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.240]   And you are starting to question God's ability
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.480]   to beautify your situation.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.400]   And so what we try to do is we put God on this shot clock.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.920]   We got this amount of time for him to do something.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.520]   And now you find yourself, like me,
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.200]   in a lot of different seasons that I can look back
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.600]   on disappointed and discouraged with God.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.840]   You're frustrated because he's not beautifying
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.880]   your life and your timing.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.840]   And listen, God sits outside of time.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.600]   Time doesn't exist in his kingdom.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.040]   Time isn't in heaven.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.800]   Like, there's no time in heaven.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.880]   But this is all we know,
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.640]   and this is all of our minds can grasp.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.320]   And we've been given a particular amount of time,
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.760]   and maybe today you walk in and you're just discouraged
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.760]   with how life is turning out.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.680]   And so I want to just say a statement up front
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.320]   that I believe is biblically rooted.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.680]   It's going to need some unpacking
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.900]   as we go throughout the message,
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.480]   but I just want to share this statement.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.120]   And can I just go like East Texas twang on you for a minute?
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.960]   Can I just do that?
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.780]   You good with that?
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.780]   Like, it won't be the city boy, you know, perfect language,
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.000]   but let me just go East Texas country twang on you.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.880]   If it ain't good, God ain't done.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.040]   Okay?
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.800]   If it ain't good in your life, God ain't done.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.640]   Another way of saying that,
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.160]   if something isn't good in your life,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.980]   then God isn't done.
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.100]   And I'm going to show you where that is in scripture
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.320]   as we travel through the scripture tonight,
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.360]   but we're going to be in the book of Ecclesiastes
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.400]   and we're going to see God begin to show us
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.000]   that there's this time for everything.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.900]   And then we're going to see
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.260]   that God makes everything beautiful in its time.
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.480]   And I don't want you to get lost with this statement
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.720]   because some of you would take this statement,
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.540]   it ain't good.
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.560]   If it ain't good, then God ain't done.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.520]   It's like, well, if singleness, I guess, you know,
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.040]   God's just going to give me a spouse.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.040]   Or it's like, you know, I'm destined to be a millionaire
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.900]   by the time I'm 35.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.960]   And you just start having this name it and claim it,
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.880]   this health, wealth, and prosperity type of theology.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.360]   And I don't think the problem with that is
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.720]   I just don't think our definition of good
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   is the same as God's definition of good.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.680]   And that's really the problem at the end of the day, amen?
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.320]   And so sometimes we're going to see
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.040]   as we unpack Ecclesiastes three,
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.800]   that God's definition is different than ours.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.400]   And we're going to see throughout the scriptures
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.840]   as we cross-reference different ones across Earth
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.240]   throughout this time,
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.120]   we're going to see that sometimes God does allow pain
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.160]   and suffering to mark our life.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.680]   So we're going to be in Ecclesiastes three.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.640]   If you have a Bible, you can open up there,
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.080]   open it up to Ecclesiastes three.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.880]   If you don't, then I just want to share this
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.000]   every single week.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.240]   We have a Bible for you out in the town center.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.600]   You can go to the welcome desk directly after the service,
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.720]   and we would love to give you a physical copy of God's word.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.480]   And so we're going to be in Ecclesiastes three
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.160]   and we're going to study about a man named Solomon.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.680]   History, not just the Bible,
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.660]   says that Solomon was actually a king.
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.500]   No one denies that.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.080]   Every atheist who is well-studied will acknowledge
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.360]   that there's a very wealthy king named Solomon.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.520]   Maybe the wealthiest to ever live, Wikipedia would say.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.600]   We're learning from a man
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.640]   who was one of the most powerful people on the Earth.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.120]   And in the end of his life, he's at the end of his life,
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.740]   and he's just writing out these journal entries.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.200]   He's reflecting back on this experiment
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.760]   that really just failed miserably,
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.320]   that he was trying everything underneath the sun
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.200]   and it left him empty.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.540]   An experiment where he was trying to find meaning in life.
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.560]   He finds it in pleasure and the party.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.860]   Like this dude would throw massive parties.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.960]   Like thousands of people would come to his party.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.620]   He would try to find it in music.
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.780]   Like you think, hey, you know, Taylor Swift concert.
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.800]   Like Taylor Swift was playing in his backyard.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.040]   Like that's the kind of person,
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.720]   like he owned the Billboard's top chart music.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.080]   That was him.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.320]   700 wives, the scripture says, 300 concubines.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.940]   A concubine is just a live-in girlfriend.
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.920]   That's the kind of man we're talking about.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.360]   This guy who had power.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.760]   Think president of the United States,
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.920]   a man who was the wisest in his day.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.080]   He had education.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.840]   Think Elon Musk, Bill Gates.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.800]   And he's coming up empty and he's miserable.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.640]   And the craziest thing that we could do tonight
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.860]   is walk out those doors and repeat the experiment.
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.880]   And begin to look for life apart from God.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.120]   That's what this means.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.420]   You know, under the sun, we learned that two weeks ago
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.840]   when Tommy was here, that under the sun means
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:25.000]   that we will try to find life apart from God.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.440]   In the first two chapters of Ecclesiastes,
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.800]   he just says all is vanity apart from God.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.520]   And so now we're gonna be in chapter three
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.080]   and he's gonna talk about life with God.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.980]   So here we go.
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.640]   Chapter three, verse one.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.160]   There is a time for everything
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.360]   and a season for every activity under the heavens.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.280]   A time to be born and a time to die.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.840]   So a person's birthday and their funeral.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.760]   A time to plant and a time to uproot.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.840]   And so now not just a person, but with plants,
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.440]   a time to plant and a time to uproot that plant.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.260]   And now you're just gonna hear like an array of emotions.
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.920]   Good and bad, exciting, not so exciting.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.600]   Fluctuating of emotions.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.360]   A time to kill and a time to heal.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.300]   A time to tear down and a time to build.
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.040]   And you're gonna find yourself
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.960]   in the midst of these emotions.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.400]   Just think back on your life.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.040]   A time to weep and a time to laugh,
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.960]   a time to mourn and a time to dance.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.920]   Anyone?
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.800]   A time to scatter stones and a time to gather them.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.840]   A time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.360]   A time to search and a time to give up.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.280]   A time to keep and a time to throw away.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.260]   A time to tear and a time to mend.
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.320]   A time to be silent and a time to speak.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.200]   A time to love and a time to hate.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.720]   A time for war and a time for peace.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.680]   First point of tonight I wanna make is just this,
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.040]   a time for everything, just like the text said.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.880]   A time for everything.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.400]   This is the human experience
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.640]   of every person that ever lives, right?
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.420]   Like this is what we experience under the sun,
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:08.480]   which is an appointed time for every kind of experience.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.160]   Solomon is saying, God has the day of our birth
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:16.160]   and the day of our death in his sovereign plan.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.280]   All events happen between our birth and death.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.520]   God is in control of it all.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.880]   And then verse three through eight, he's just saying,
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.760]   and he's not just in control of the good times,
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.040]   he's in control of the bad times.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.860]   Everyone will mourn and everyone will dance,
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.440]   everyone will laugh and everyone will cry.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.880]   And again, everyone will be born and everyone will die.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.460]   He doesn't just avoid the highs,
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.560]   but he also shows you the lows,
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.080]   or he doesn't just talk about the highs,
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.840]   he also shows you the lows of life.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.840]   Like nobody gets to avoid
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.200]   the different array of emotions in this text.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.600]   There's pain in this world.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.320]   This isn't the world we had.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.440]   This isn't Genesis one and two,
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.640]   where God creates everything and he says it's good
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.200]   and he creates everything and he says it's good
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.880]   and he does this six times over the course of six days.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.580]   And on the seventh day he rests and it's Adam and it's God
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.140]   and everything's harmonious,
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.920]   everything's in its perfect place, its rightful place.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.280]   This is Genesis one and two.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.020]   This is not what we had.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.920]   This is now what we have, Genesis three,
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.900]   where sin entered into creation
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.040]   and it sent creation into chaos.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.360]   And so we see some jacked up things happening in the world.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.360]   All suffering is a result of Genesis three, six,
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.280]   the fall of man.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.960]   So if something's not good,
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.840]   you can point back to sin, Genesis three, six,
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.240]   the fall of man.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.240]   And so we've inherited all of that since that moment.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.480]   And so there's this gap now from the time we were born
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.880]   to the time we die and it's called life and life is hard.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.620]   Like I don't think I have to convince you of that tonight.
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:58.200]   And he's saying, hey, paradise lost though,
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.560]   will be paradise regained someday.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.560]   It's not the life that we will have.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.080]   I've read the rest of the book.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.840]   If you haven't, I encourage you to.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:11.440]   But in the gap there's pain.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.200]   And in the middle, the gap is where we kind of come up
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.880]   with some really weird views of God.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.680]   You'll hear TA say a lot, his mentor told him,
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.660]   our view of God determines our response to God.
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.280]   And so some of us, we have the wrong response to God
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.640]   because of our view of God.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.280]   Like some of us might say things like,
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.440]   well, if God is good, then he wouldn't blank.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.360]   Or if there's a God that I wouldn't experience, feel this.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.240]   Well, you know, God wouldn't give me the desire
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.560]   to get married if he didn't have a spouse for me.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.040]   You know, God wouldn't give me the desire
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.320]   to be a millionaire if he wasn't gonna make me a millionaire.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.720]   This, again, name it and claim it theology.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.200]   God wouldn't give me the desire for children
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.880]   or the desire for health if he wasn't gonna provide health
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.760]   and children for me.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.920]   And so we just have this weird view of who God is
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.820]   based on the gap, the suffering, the sin, the pain
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.500]   that we all experience.
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:16.100]   The problem with that thinking is that you can have
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.560]   a deep, deep need to get married.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.000]   And then you can walk out of this place, get in your car,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.940]   get hit by a car and die.
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.440]   And you're like, bro, that just escalated quickly.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.560]   But that's my point, right?
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.600]   It's like you could go and that could happen to you.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.600]   And then everything that you thought about God is not true
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.100]   because that's wrong thinking.
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.200]   Because of suffering, the world is fractured.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.540]   Jesus said it like this in John 16, 33.
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.000]   He said, "I have said these things to you
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.880]   "that in me you may have peace.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.820]   "In the world you will have tribulation,
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.140]   "but take heart, I've overcome the world."
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.440]   So even in this verse, Jesus is saying,
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.480]   hey, you're gonna have peace in me,
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.940]   but in the world you're gonna have tribulation.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.760]   So it's just this time for everything.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.420]   You're gonna have both peace and tribulation,
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:22.420]   peace and testing, peace and pain, peace and suffering.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.480]   But take heart, he's overcome the world.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.480]   We know the story that he wrote
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.720]   through the person of Jesus.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.840]   We'll talk about that more
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.780]   as we continue to progress this evening.
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.600]   Jesus also said this in John 10, 10.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.860]   "The thief comes only to steal, kill and destroy.
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.400]   "I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:47.000]   This idea that, hey, there's an adversary out there
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.120]   and his job is to steal,
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.680]   to take things from you that aren't his,
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.820]   kill, ultimately take you out and destroy you,
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.080]   to just annihilate you
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.740]   so that you can't experience the life
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.960]   that Jesus wants you to experience.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.920]   So you can see life is filled with highs and lows,
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.920]   ups and downs, and I've learned this
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.940]   by just watching how life unfolds.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.700]   Like one of the times I've learned this the most
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:22.580]   was when I watched a couple get married.
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.840]   Like they dated and got engaged and got married
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.860]   and then pain settled in.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.920]   And this couple happened to be,
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.420]   or happens to be my brother-in-law and sister-in-law.
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.740]   You see, I coached in my previous life.
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.580]   You're like, you were a coach?
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:36.460]   Yeah, I was a coach.
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.220]   I coached at James Madison University,
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.500]   coached baseball and coached a young man named Alex Foltz.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.460]   And then I was dating a girl you saw up on the screen
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.300]   a minute ago, Kathy.
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.340]   And I was like, you know, like you got a sister.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.520]   Let me play matchmaker.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.360]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.940]   I've been known to set some people up in my day.
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:02.940]   And so your boy introduced Alex to Jenny
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.180]   and they started dating and it was beautiful.
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.020]   Like it was awesome.
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.180]   It was, you know, the sparks were flying
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.460]   and man, they were progressing.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.580]   And he was playing minor league baseball at the time.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.460]   She was living in New Orleans as a pediatric nurse.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.260]   And you know, they were doing their thing long distance.
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.660]   And then he's like, it's time for me to put a ring on it.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.780]   I'm like, all right, let's go, bro.
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:27.220]   And so he puts a ring on it and they get married
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.420]   and it's amazing, the highs of life.
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.940]   And then all of a sudden, in a matter of two years,
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.220]   a little over two years,
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.140]   they get some of the most devastating news
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.180]   that a person could ever have.
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.940]   And I thought to myself, man, what would it be like
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.420]   if I just called her this morning?
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.620]   You know, the problem with that is she lives
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.700]   in a remote place in West Virginia.
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.100]   She's a turkey farmer.
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.540]   Well, she ain't, her husband is.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.540]   And I was like, I think we could put you on a plane
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.020]   and get you down here.
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.140]   And so she's here.
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:05.140]   And I want her to give you part of her journey
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:09.820]   as she's experienced the highs and the lows
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.860]   of what Solomon is talking about in Ecclesiastes 3.
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.780]   Would you welcome to the stage, Jenny Foltz.
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.280]   (congregation applauding)
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:25.820]   - Thank you. - Love you, girl.
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.100]   - Love you. - Do your thing.
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:32.100]   - Goodness, it's humbling to be here tonight.
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.980]   I never would have imagined myself up here
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.820]   in front of y'all.
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.860]   I've watched remotely online on a farm in West Virginia.
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.160]   I've taken some of the classes and courses.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.700]   And so Watermark has been a big gift for me.
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.540]   And so to be here tonight is all God.
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.860]   And I'm hoping to bring my fish and loaves
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.860]   and he multiplies it for his glory.
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.020]   And I'm gonna read.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.960]   I'm not gonna be near as animated as Josiah.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.340]   I'm gonna be right here in my box.
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.500]   So here we go.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:03.340]   All right, we all have a story to tell.
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.160]   As a follower of Jesus and an adopted child of God,
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.100]   the neatest thing about all of our stories
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.180]   is they are connected through him.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.600]   Tonight, I am humbled to share a part of my story
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.660]   the Lord has faithfully walked me and my husband through.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.100]   A time in my life where God met me
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.780]   right where I was in my pain,
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.080]   how he pursued my heart and how he changed the meaning
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.740]   of what I thought a good life meant.
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.300]   At the time, Alex and I had been married
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.940]   a little over two and a half years
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.780]   and we lived on the family farm.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.020]   This big city girl, big city like he said,
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.620]   New Orleans, Dallas, Fort Worth, turned farmer's wife,
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.340]   had just had her 30th birthday
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:40.460]   and I was enjoying a nice career as a pediatric nurse.
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.020]   We were expecting our first child
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.980]   and planning to announce it to our family soon.
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.540]   Everything was going smoothly, life was good
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.540]   until one day it wasn't, cancer.
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.860]   At eight weeks pregnant,
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:56.380]   I was diagnosed with stage three advanced cancer.
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.580]   Shocked and disbelief quickly took hold.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.780]   What was happening?
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.420]   How was this possible?
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:03.740]   Surely this was a bad dream
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.900]   I would wake up from at any moment.
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.060]   To give myself the best chance of survival,
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.740]   we were advised to have an abortion
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.300]   and start treatment right away.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.140]   At that moment, my definition of a fun,
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.340]   adventurous and good life was falling apart
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.420]   right before my eyes.
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.180]   This was the start of a jolting life
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.660]   I didn't know I needed.
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.780]   A splash of ice cold water to a fate
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.060]   that was lukewarm and stagnant at best.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.420]   Alex and I wanted to give our baby a chance to live,
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.620]   even if that posed a greater risk to my health.
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.220]   In faith, we pursued a customized treatment plan.
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.940]   The doctors would perform major abdominal surgery
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.180]   to remove the tumor
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:43.740]   and they would place an ileostomy bag
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:44.940]   at nine weeks pregnant.
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.780]   It's okay if you don't know what that is.
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.140]   We had some really hard days
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.280]   full of fear that were almost crippling.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.540]   The what ifs and the unknowns
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.780]   were all I could think of at times.
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.700]   Moments when Alex had to peel me out from under the covers
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.900]   and moments I felt like I would physically be sick
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:00.820]   from the fear.
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.460]   And do you know what God was teaching me,
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.180]   showing me and asking me?
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.060]   Little by little, moment by moment,
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.180]   I was confronted with the questions.
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.220]   Do you really believe what you say about me?
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.060]   Do you remember or even know who I am?
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.220]   Will you trust me?
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.740]   Perhaps I thought I was immune to what Jesus said
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:27.060]   in John 16, 33, as Josiah mentioned earlier,
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.140]   when he said, "In this world, you will have trouble,
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.820]   but take heart, I will overcome the world."
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.440]   Well, I was definitely surprised and shocked,
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.860]   to say the least, by the trouble that had come my way.
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:40.820]   I knew God was making a mistake.
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.820]   Just kidding, I know God doesn't make mistakes.
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.020]   This wasn't exactly the suffering I was wanting
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.580]   or expecting or had in mind for the plan of my life.
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.940]   And God, in his kindness, got right down to my level
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.140]   and sat with me in my fears, doubts, questions,
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.300]   and patiently started to show me who he really was,
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.620]   who he is.
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.100]   And once the fog cleared,
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.940]   I ultimately wanted to be a part of his glory being revealed.
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.780]   I was learning and still am learning
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:11.740]   what it means to lose oneself for Christ is actually gain.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.780]   And to be refined by fire is painful.
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.460]   Killing your flesh isn't pretty,
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.280]   but I was starting to want more of him
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.080]   and less of me.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.980]   He was slowly but surely making his scripture
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.700]   come alive in my heart.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.100]   And when the fear would start to overcome me,
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.900]   and trust me, I have many stories
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.100]   of the battles against fear,
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.300]   he would remind me with his scripture,
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.700]   like this one from Isaiah 41 10.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.140]   "Fear not, for I am with you.
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.900]   Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.420]   I will strengthen and I will help you.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:47.180]   I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.760]   I remember when I was getting my hour long MRI,
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.720]   how scared I was.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.000]   And during that hour,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.420]   I felt the Holy Spirit whisper in Jenny language,
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.400]   "I've got you, you are okay."
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.780]   What I learned and what I want you to understand
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.760]   this evening is that he wasn't telling me
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.840]   everything was going to be easy.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.960]   He wasn't telling me that I didn't have cancer.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.100]   He wasn't telling me everything was going to be fine
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.360]   in my shallow earthly standards.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.520]   He was saying, "Trust me, Jenny.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.680]   Trust me no matter what.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.840]   Whether you die of cancer in six months
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.200]   or live to a ripe old age of 100,
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.280]   you can trust me."
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.640]   God was slowly redefining what it meant
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.480]   to have a good life.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.880]   He was transforming my heart
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.860]   and teaching me to stand on his promises,
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.600]   like in Isaiah 43, where he says,
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.360]   "I will be with you no matter what.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.540]   I love you.
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.240]   You are precious to me.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.640]   Trust me."
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.960]   And you can trust him too
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.760]   with whatever you are going through.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.880]   The week spent in the hospital after surgery
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.040]   was a hard one.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.920]   A week filled with many moments of pain,
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.720]   weight loss, nausea, vomiting,
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.160]   injured tubes, but also with flowers,
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.160]   cards, texts, and phone calls.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.360]   I could name countless ways God uses people
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.040]   to encourage us when we needed it most.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.640]   Another sweet gift was the ability
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.480]   to see our baby every single day
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.480]   through ultrasound due to the high-risk surgery.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.480]   We were able to see little nubs grow
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.840]   into arms and legs right before our eyes,
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.080]   having something to celebrate during the trial
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.720]   was such a gift from God.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.520]   During those 14 months,
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.700]   mom was up helping take care of me and Alex,
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.800]   and there were a couple things she said
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.100]   that really stuck with me.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:30.120]   Anytime she would see fear start to take over,
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.040]   she would stop, look at me, and say,
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.160]   "Jenny, what are you afraid of?
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.360]   Tell me."
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.280]   And I would respond with, "Well, what if I die,
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.320]   and I can't be here with Alex or to raise our baby?"
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.960]   And she would look at me and kindly, gracefully say,
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.960]   "Okay, well, what if you do?
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.000]   Is there anything you can really do about that?
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.320]   And do you trust God with Alex and your child
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.880]   if that's the plan he has for you?"
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.680]   What am I supposed to say to that, mom?
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.160]   (laughs)
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.480]   But I knew she was right.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:02.600]   And I didn't really like it, honestly.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.800]   And God knows that.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.640]   He knows our hearts.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.560]   I don't think he asked us to like it.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.760]   He just asked us to continue to walk in trust.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.400]   Over time, if we let him,
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.260]   our hearts will change from resistance to gratitude.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.000]   But there's something about naming your fear
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.080]   and praying over it.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.480]   It doesn't change your circumstance,
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.280]   but it does change your perspective.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.600]   And like I read recently,
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.780]   instead of telling your God how big your problem is,
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.840]   start telling your problem how big your God is.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.880]   It helps.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.960]   It really does.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.920]   Another mom moment.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.120]   We were all driving in the car together.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.760]   We were having a bad day.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.960]   Don't remember who said it,
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.920]   but one of us said,
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.160]   "I wish everything would just go back to normal."
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.920]   And my sweet mom again said,
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.880]   "But do you really?
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.640]   Do you really want everything to go back
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.500]   to the way it was before?
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.300]   If you don't change, then what's the point?
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.520]   This would all be a waste if you don't let God use this.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.160]   How will you live differently after this?"
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.560]   It was hard to hear, but she was right, again.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.720]   God is really good at turning your ashes
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.760]   into something beautiful if you let him.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.760]   After recovering from surgery,
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.880]   my second trimester consisted of three months of IV chemo.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.280]   And on February 5th, 2018,
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.860]   the miracle we had all been praying for happened.
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:21.360]   We delivered a healthy baby boy named Alex Carter Fultz.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.800]   Carter is now five and a half years old.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.740]   Don't worry, he's still very much a wild
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.840]   and crazy five-year-old who thinks his weight
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.280]   is always best.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.020]   But we love our little wild and crazy boy to pieces.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.240]   And I wish I could tell you that after he was born,
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.520]   that I was cancer-free.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.880]   When Carter was two months old,
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.840]   my doctor called with the results from a recent scan.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.840]   I still had cancer in an area that would be hard to remove.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.040]   I would need another surgery, more chemo, and radiation.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.040]   I don't have time to tell you about all these struggles
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.200]   during this phase, but I will tell you about one.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.520]   As I'm in my hospital room,
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.040]   the doctors come in ecstatic
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.000]   about the results of the surgery.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.580]   The surgery was successful,
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:07.280]   but the upcoming treatments of radiation and a surgery
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.760]   would likely take away the ability for Alex and I
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.840]   to have more children.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.080]   I cannot tell you the heart pain I felt in this moment,
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.880]   the torn emotions between the lymph nodes
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.520]   successfully being removed and the loss of a dream
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.140]   all in one package.
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.240]   I remember the surgeon looking at me like it was yesterday
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.880]   and saying, "I know how badly you want more children,
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.580]   "and I'm so very sorry.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.380]   "You have fought so hard for Carter,
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.220]   "and today we have the privilege to fight hard for you."
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:40.500]   This was and still is a really hard part of our journey.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.580]   I remember praying, "Lord, please not this, not this."
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.900]   And again, he spoke to me and said,
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.660]   "Jenny, do you trust me?"
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:54.820]   Psalm 37, four says, "Delight yourself in the Lord,
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.780]   "and he will give you the desires of your heart."
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.280]   I learned that verse is not saying, "Seek me,
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.940]   "and I will give you all that you desire,"
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.700]   but instead, "Seek me, and I will be all that you desire."
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:09.060]   I needed to want him more than I wanted the healing.
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.980]   I needed to love him and desire him more than my want
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.580]   and desire for more children.
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:17.140]   Now, I also don't have time to tell you
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.820]   about the radiation experience either,
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.100]   but I will tell you it was tough.
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.220]   The weight loss, the burns, the daily IV fluids,
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.140]   more nausea and vomiting, a teething baby,
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.300]   all the possible lifelong side effects,
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.680]   and I could go on and on.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.380]   It was physically, mentally, and emotionally hard,
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.180]   and yet, another opportunity to trust the Lord.
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:42.020]   On August 16th, 2018, we had our first clear scans.
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:45.140]   On August 22nd, 2018, my port was removed.
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:48.900]   In September 28th, 2018, I would have my third surgery
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.060]   to reverse the ileostomy bag.
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.700]   All praise, glory, and thanks be to Jesus.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.580]   I am so very grateful for the healing
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.340]   and for our son, Carter.
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:01.900]   Those are gifts, but they aren't the prize.
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.380]   Jesus is the prize.
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.900]   Janet Erickson Stewart said,
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.020]   "Joy is not the absent of suffering,
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.780]   "but the presence of God."
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:13.220]   My definition of what a good life meant
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.480]   would forever be changed.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.940]   The good in life is not earthly, but heavenly,
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:21.200]   and I cannot wait to see Jesus in all of his glory.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.100]   No more tears, no more suffering, no more death.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:28.300]   I thought I knew that, but with the help of the Holy Spirit,
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.100]   he's helping me learn to live it.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:34.500]   As I tell my story, I know full well that healing
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.140]   on this earth is not always a part of everyone's story.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.900]   I had several friends diagnosed alongside of me
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.100]   that went to be with Jesus,
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.060]   who had young children and husbands as well.
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.160]   I can never even come close to trying to explain
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.580]   the why behind the suffering we see in this world,
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.820]   but I can tell you all about the one, Jesus,
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.560]   who walked with me and my husband through it,
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.560]   and he is walking with you as well.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:04.940]   I have a theme verse, 2 Corinthians 4, 16, 18.
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.300]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.340]   the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.220]   who comforts us in all our afflictions
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.840]   so that we may be able to comfort those
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.900]   who are in any affliction with the comfort
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.440]   with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.180]   Because of what God walked me through
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.860]   and how he comforts me, I hope to also be a comfort
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.420]   to others during their time of need.
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.680]   I'll end with a quote from Elizabeth Elliot.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.360]   The deepest things that I have learned in my own life
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.480]   have come from the deepest suffering,
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.000]   and out of the deepest waters and the hottest fires
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.940]   have come the deepest things that I know about God.
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:45.680]   Because suffering, if we let God work, is never for nothing.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.320]   God hasn't wasted my suffering,
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.880]   and he won't waste your suffering
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.120]   when you choose to trust him.
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.740]   He's not done writing my story,
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.920]   and he's not done writing your story.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.600]   You can trust him as well.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.980]   (congregation applauding)
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:11.260]   Praise God.
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.100]   You might've heard me say as she walked up here,
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.320]   I just said, "Hey, you do your thing."
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.340]   And that just means, hey, you just make God famous
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:18.640]   in the midst of your pain.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.540]   You just make much of him, and as you continue
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:26.260]   to live with the scars and you live with the story
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.420]   that God has given you and that he's continuing
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:33.420]   to write for you, and that's what pain is for.
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.220]   That's one of the reasons what pain is for,
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.980]   is that it grows dependence on God.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.060]   It refines you in a way where all the things
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:46.260]   that Solomon tried to pursue in the first two chapters
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:50.260]   are vanity apart from God.
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.460]   That's what pain does, is it humanizes you,
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:55.340]   and it shows you that there's something beyond
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.500]   the clouds, like the world.
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.860]   It's something beyond just what we live and breathe
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.660]   and do day in and day out.
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:09.020]   There's a God who came ultimately for suffering,
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.220]   which we'll talk about here in a little bit.
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:17.540]   Ecclesiastes 3, verse nine, Solomon goes on to say,
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.420]   "What do workers gain for their toil?"
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:23.180]   Or what does workers gain from their toil, better yet said?
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:26.140]   "What do they profit or what do they show
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.660]   "from all their work," is what he's saying.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:30.580]   He's saying that no matter how good you are at work,
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.300]   you will die and you will lose everything.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.180]   Tommy said it like this two weeks ago.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:36.920]   He just says, "That's why you never see a hearse
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.460]   "pulling a U-Haul, because all of that's gonna be gone.
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.180]   "You can't take it with you."
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:46.700]   Goes on and says in verse 10, "I have seen the burden,"
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.100]   another translation says, "I have seen the task.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.580]   "I have seen the burden of the task
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.940]   "God has laid on the human race."
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:58.740]   This burden or this task is talking about how life is hard.
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.580]   Here in this chapter, like I said earlier,
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.100]   he's writing to the believer.
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:07.100]   He's writing to the person who has their eyes open to God.
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:14.140]   And he's saying these things from a place of,
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.960]   hey, their eyes have been open to the truth,
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.660]   and so what do you do when life is filled
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.300]   with question marks when you sometimes look at the Bible
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.820]   and it's just filled with exclamation points?
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.660]   Like what do you do when that happens?
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.820]   Like what do you do when you find your faith
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:34.980]   that's in a crisis?
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:39.580]   Like why does the Bible and God allow suffering and pain
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.060]   if he's good?
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:45.300]   The routine checkup that ends up stage three cancer at 30,
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.700]   or the person that got on the road
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:52.580]   and got hit by another car and their life is taken,
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.720]   or the four-year-old who drowned in the pool to death.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:59.120]   Like what do you do with those things?
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.180]   That's why, you know, if you ever lead someone to Christ,
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.020]   you don't just say, "Hey, come to Christ
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.020]   "and he'll make everything better."
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:09.300]   That's not accurate.
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:13.020]   When we read verses like John 16, 33,
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.860]   "In this world you will have tribulation,
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.220]   "but take heart, I've overcome the world."
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.100]   There's a promise attached to that.
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:21.340]   And so what's our solution?
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.180]   Is it deism?
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.760]   There's a God, but he's just absent?
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.780]   He's kind of on furlough, he's on a break,
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:29.180]   he's not really present in people's lives?
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.300]   Is it dualism?
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.740]   Like, you know, Satan and God,
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.460]   they're going back and forth,
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.980]   and sometimes God wins and sometimes Satan wins,
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.700]   and there's this tennis match,
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:44.120]   and they're just kind of going back and forth.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.640]   (pages rustling)
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.920]   Satan and God are vying for the throne?
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.400]   Oh no.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:55.680]   God uses Satan and evil to accomplish his purposes
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.960]   in this world.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:00.160]   And that Satan and evil,
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.120]   it's not like Satan and God are here.
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:05.040]   No, it's God, and Satan is below him,
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.360]   and Satan has to consult with God
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.000]   in everything that he does.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.200]   Have you ever read the book of Job?
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.120]   Like, you should read that at some point.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:22.220]   Job, he lost his possessions, his children, and his health.
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:23.740]   That's a book in the Bible.
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:27.280]   Do we understand all things?
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.740]   No, we don't understand all things,
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:33.040]   but we have to believe that God is in control of all things.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.420]   Like, if I were to go home tonight,
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:37.020]   and I find out that my house was burned down,
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.760]   and my wife is dead, and my three kids are dead,
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.680]   don't just tell me accidents happen.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.240]   That's not gonna be enough.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.180]   Like, I gotta know that God is in control.
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:50.080]   If I go to the doctor, and he gives me the results,
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.840]   and I have two weeks to live,
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:55.360]   like, it's not gonna be enough for you to say,
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.880]   "God's not God."
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.920]   I have to know that God is in control,
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.360]   and he's made a way for life after death.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:05.960]   If I don't believe that, then I run to the bottle to cope.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.140]   I run to a drug.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:08.920]   I run to an illegitimate relationship.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.960]   I run to the party.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.880]   I run to the things that are going to numb me.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:16.680]   Like, it's not gonna be helpful.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.820]   Accidents happen?
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.480]   That's not helpful.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:27.300]   God's in control, even if we can't explain everything,
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.720]   because he's made a way
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.880]   for you and I to be reconciled with him.
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:40.400]   How many of you, in the last five years, if you're honest,
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.860]   you've experienced pain
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:46.180]   that you can't really make sense of?
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.420]   Just a show of hands, how many of you?
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.940]   In the last five years?
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:50.580]   Wow.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.900]   Like, just hold them up a little higher.
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.380]   Do you see this?
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.940]   All right, you can put them down.
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.780]   Like, do you see the hands are in the air?
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:05.780]   Like, how do we make sense in the midst of pain?
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:12.200]   James 1 says this half-brother of Jesus,
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.040]   I think he's got some pretty good advice.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.780]   Verse 2, he says, "Consider it pure joy,
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:17.780]   "my brothers and sisters,
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:21.540]   "whenever you face trials of many kind."
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:24.160]   I love it when it says when, not if, right?
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.320]   That's important.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.600]   "Because you know that the testing of your faith
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.380]   "produces perseverance,
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.960]   "so let perseverance finish its work
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.140]   "so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing."
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.420]   God wants to get you and I to a place
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.180]   where he is the end goal.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.620]   Nothing else.
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.060]   Like, when I was at 30, wondering, like,
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.340]   "God, do you have someone for me?"
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.420]   He's like, "Wait, wait, am I enough, Josiah?
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.540]   "If I don't, if I don't have a spouse for you,
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.020]   "am I enough?"
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.900]   And I remember just laying in bed at night,
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.300]   just, I mean, I'm not ashamed.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.940]   I mean, the scripture says,
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:57.900]   "Time for everything."
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:58.740]   I was crying.
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.780]   I mean, I was trying to, I was a youth pastor,
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:03.540]   trying to follow Jesus.
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:07.500]   And just like, "Did you forget about me, God?"
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:11.820]   I mean, he's trying to get us to a point
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.540]   where he's the end.
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.180]   Because if he's not at the end,
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.420]   then when you do get married,
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.620]   you're going to make that spouse your savior
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.400]   and spouses make miserable saviors.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.300]   That's a whole nother message.
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.700]   Let me get back to the text.
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.740]   Sorry, T.A., man, I can just go on a rant,
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.140]   but I'll get back, I'll get back.
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:29.780]   What about the story of Joseph?
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.700]   Like, you know the story of Joseph,
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.940]   like thrown into a pit, sold into slavery
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.580]   by his own brothers.
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.860]   And then he gets caught up in this sex scandal.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:40.700]   Yeah, that's in our Bible.
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.060]   He gets caught up in a sex scandal,
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:45.780]   accused wrongly, and gets thrown in prison.
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.460]   But then slowly but surely,
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.900]   he begins to rebuild trust and become second in command.
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:55.020]   And this is what he says in verse 20 of Genesis 50.
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.280]   "As for you, you meant evil against me,
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.180]   "but God meant it for good."
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.420]   Crazy, man.
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:04.580]   I think Jenny could say that tonight.
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:08.180]   What, you know, the cancer looks like evil,
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:09.540]   man, God meant it for good.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.140]   We can see that.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.580]   She can't answer every question of why things happen,
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.700]   but slowly but surely, God's starting to make sense of it.
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.600]   And she's being used by God to share her story.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.700]   This is why Solomon says in verse 11,
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.180]   getting back to the text in Ecclesiastes 3,
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:33.100]   he just says, "He, God, has made everything beautiful
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.380]   "in its time," which is point number two,
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.300]   and I'm gonna move fast.
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.140]   He makes everything beautiful in its time.
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.140]   And this is where I get the truth.
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:43.620]   If it ain't good, God ain't done.
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.900]   Or if something's not good in your life,
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.740]   then God isn't done.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:51.260]   It's a verse, we have a verse, it's Romans 8:28,
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.320]   that God causes all things to work together for the good.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.900]   This is what it says in Romans 8:28.
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.500]   And we know that for those who love God,
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.580]   all things, just circle that, all, good and bad,
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:04.020]   things work together for good
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:07.460]   for those who are called according to his purpose.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.580]   I wish I could unpack that more, I don't have time.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:10.920]   But you should highlight that,
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.940]   and you should go back and study that.
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.300]   Solomon continues in the second half of verse 11,
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:18.020]   he just says this, "He has also set eternity
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.700]   "in the human heart, yet no one can fathom
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:24.780]   "what God has done from beginning to end."
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:27.580]   Like we have a longing to see how God sees,
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.180]   yet we can't make sense of it,
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.700]   so sometimes it leads to frustration and disappointments.
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:37.020]   And we have to sometimes just live in that,
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:40.260]   and it builds trust, it allows that faith muscle
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:44.300]   to get stronger and stronger and stronger.
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:48.900]   And God begins to reveal how he wants you to use that pain,
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:51.660]   that suffering, like he has in Jenny's life.
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:56.780]   We have this eternal void, verse 11 says,
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.260]   that nothing under the sun can fill it.
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.620]   Like you can leave here and you can go fill it
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.620]   with your hypoallergenic Labradoodle or your Maltese,
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:07.620]   but it's not gonna fill it, right?
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:11.260]   Like you can run to your job,
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:14.060]   and you can try to climb the ladder of corporate success,
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:17.340]   and get that corner office, and that raise,
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.540]   and make six figures, or be a millionaire
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.640]   by the time you're 30 or 35, but it ain't gonna fill it.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.000]   You can stuff the Tesla in there,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   you can stuff the house within that certain zip code,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   you can stuff that Instagram reel
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.840]   that you made over the 4th of July,
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.520]   that you got people getting likes on,
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:38.600]   and all of your influence, and it's not going to fill it.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:44.040]   Like that's what Solomon is getting at in verse 11.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:49.640]   Like he's on this trajectory where he's tried everything,
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:53.560]   and all it's doing is leaving him more and more thirsty.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:58.640]   It's kind of like saltwater.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.480]   Do you know anything about saltwater?
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:04.400]   Like saltwater, like if you're stranded at the sea,
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:09.400]   and you get thirsty, and you begin to drink saltwater,
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:12.180]   like it's not gonna go well for you,
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.860]   because the point of saltwater is that the more you drink,
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.640]   the more thirsty you're gonna become.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.920]   And the world, you're traveling through life,
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.920]   and the world is offering you saltwater.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.360]   And the more you drink it,
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.920]   the more thirsty you are gonna become.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.240]   Like so many of us, we come into this place thinking,
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.520]   yeah, I'm gonna be satisfied if I just get that,
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.060]   you fill in the blank.
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:40.000]   And Solomon is saying that you're just drinking saltwater,
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.080]   that nothing in this world will satisfy your thirst,
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.020]   but only leave you more and more thirsty.
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:52.240]   He said eternity in every human heart.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:57.720]   I'll close with this.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:03.440]   What else, another thing that helps me
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:07.160]   deal with suffering in this life, the pain.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.980]   I don't even have time to go into it,
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:12.500]   but whether it's a phone call that I got
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:17.340]   when I was in my 20s from a good friend of mine
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.140]   that we roomed together with,
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:20.340]   this guy was my roommate,
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.100]   and he was calling about our roommate,
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:24.940]   and he was calling to tell me that he got,
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:29.080]   that his plane went down, he had a tragic plane accident,
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.780]   and our roommate died.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:34.240]   I don't know what your suffering is,
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:35.760]   I don't know what your tragedy is,
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.340]   I don't know what that thing is,
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:39.060]   I don't know what you've walked through in life,
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:44.020]   but the gospel that helps me deal with the evil
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:45.960]   that's in this world, the suffering,
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.580]   the pain that we go through.
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.180]   Like the greatest act of injustice, think about it,
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:53.580]   that has ever took place, happened 2,000 years ago,
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:55.740]   the only perfect person to ever live,
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.940]   a divine man was rejected, betrayed,
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.980]   denied, tortured, put on a cross.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:03.300]   He and all the people surrounded him,
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:06.500]   he didn't do anything to deserve that,
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:10.340]   and he died for your sin and my sin.
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:14.100]   Jesus, the one person who was perfectly righteous,
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.660]   he was without sin, was nailed to a tree
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.820]   for every injustice in this world,
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.660]   for every sin in this world,
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:25.760]   for every wrong under the sun.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.260]   He got tortured, nailed to the cross,
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.580]   suffocated to death,
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:33.460]   and what good could possibly come out of that?
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:36.020]   Yet God, he turned the most evil thing
[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:39.100]   that ever happened under the sun into good
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:40.580]   because three days later,
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.380]   the scripture says in history records
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.340]   that he rose again from the dead
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:48.380]   to defeat that sin and that suffering
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.700]   that you and I go through.
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.300]   And he hasn't eradicated it completely,
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:53.700]   there's purpose in the pain,
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.300]   he never erased any of it,
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:56.860]   but there's coming a day
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.220]   when he's gonna make every wrong right,
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.740]   no injustice will go without pay,
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:04.260]   you can either have that being paid for by him
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.860]   or it would be paid for in hell, the scripture says.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:12.700]   And I look at everything that God's done,
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:17.220]   how he's reconciled us to him as our creator,
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:18.900]   and now if God can do that,
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:22.220]   can he not take your situations and turn them for good?
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:26.540]   And he's coming back.
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:31.060]   Revelation 21, I'll end with this,
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:34.020]   I read this earlier today and I couldn't stop
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:36.620]   but just marinate on it and sit on it
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.740]   and just soak this up, this is what it says,
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:41.460]   then I saw the new heaven and the new earth,
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:44.460]   this is John getting a glimpse of what's to come
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:47.260]   for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:48.980]   and the sea was no more,
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.180]   and I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem,
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:52.500]   there's gonna be a new heavens and a new earth,
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:53.340]   you know that?
[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.340]   Coming down out of the heaven from God
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:59.180]   prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.180]   And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:04.660]   behold, the dwelling place of God is with man,
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:08.100]   he will dwell with them and they will be his people
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:12.260]   and God himself will be with them as their God.
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.500]   And don't miss this, verse four,
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.140]   he will wipe away every tear from their eyes
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.060]   and death shall be no more,
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:23.620]   neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:26.660]   for the former things have passed away.
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.300]   And he who is seated on the throne, look at what he says,
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:32.940]   behold, I'm making all things new.
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:35.100]   Where's your hope tonight?
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:40.020]   In the midst of pain, in the midst of suffering,
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:42.120]   even in the midst of highs of life.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:46.300]   Go back and read the first two chapters of Ecclesiastes.
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:49.580]   Have you come into this place
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:53.540]   and you haven't gotten to that place of all is vanity?
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:54.380]   Maybe you're just like,
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.460]   oh, I'm just gonna try the experiment out
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.300]   like Solomon did and I'm telling you, you won't be exempt.
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:03.180]   The worst thing you can do is leave this place
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.500]   and repeat the experiment.
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:08.300]   Some of us are here and like, you get it, man.
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:13.300]   You're like, yeah, only hope is built on Christ.
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.780]   When the pains of life come,
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:20.980]   I might not be able to articulate the why clearly,
[00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:25.340]   but I don't live as if all life is an accident.
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:29.900]   No, I live that there's a God and he's in control
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:33.060]   and he's made a way for every wrong to be made right.
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.300]   And he's gonna wipe away every tear from my eye
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:38.780]   and death will be no more and pain will be no more.
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:41.060]   Let me pray that you live with that hope tonight.
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:44.820]   Father God, we come before you
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:47.840]   and we ask that you would move in power and in might,
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:54.620]   that although my words may fail me, you never do.
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:58.740]   And I pray God that your word would be maximized
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:01.100]   in this place and my words would be minimized.
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:05.900]   That if anyone leaves this place and remembers anything,
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:09.420]   they would remember you and what your word says.
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:14.140]   God, would you give us the hope
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:16.060]   that this world cannot give us?
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:19.380]   And if someone's here tonight, God,
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:21.420]   and they don't have a relationship with you,
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:25.540]   they've never bended the knee in humility before you,
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:27.420]   recognize that they're a sinner,
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.380]   separated from a holy, perfect God,
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:32.380]   but you came and you were the bridge
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:36.300]   by dying on the cross for our sins
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.340]   so that we may be made right with you.
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:40.020]   And three days later, you rose again from the dead.
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.860]   If they had never truly placed their faith and trust
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:45.020]   in what you've done and they're placing their faith
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:48.940]   and trust in them, God, would they break tonight?
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:52.860]   And would they, for the first time, follow you?
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:55.140]   And then for my believing friends,
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.660]   that they wouldn't grow weary in well-doing for in due season
[00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:59.660]   you tell us we'll reap if we faint not,
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.900]   that we'll continue to trust you
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:04.000]   no matter the circumstances of life.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.660]   And you would give us more of you,
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:09.100]   and that would be enough.
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.820]   We love you and we thank you.
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:13.380]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
