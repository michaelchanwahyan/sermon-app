1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:24,240
 - What's up, Fort?

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,240
 So good to be with you guys tonight.

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,320
 I wanna say hi to our Fort Worth family

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,920
 that's just west of here.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,840
 If you're from Houston and you're not glued to a television

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,460
 watching the World Series, congratulations,

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,540
 you're the only person in Houston

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,580
 not watching the Houston Astros currently.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,840
 But we're so glad everybody's with us around the country.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,380
 And hey, I wanna tell you,

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,780
 we are starting a brand new series

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,300
 and it is called "Thou Shall."

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,540
 Now that video got me as pumped up about "Thou Shall"

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,200
 as anything ever has, because I gotta tell you,

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,920
 I got some baggage with "Thou Shall."

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,140
 I'm not a "Thou Shall" person.

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,740
 I don't respond well to commands.

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,340
 In fact, even though I grew up in a fairly church context

20
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,420
 and I was exposed to some of these commands,

21
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,620
 I didn't like 'em.

22
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,420
 And so I don't know if you've ever identified with that,

23
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,980
 but that's where I kinda grew up.

24
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,100
 And so I would find like a loophole around anything.

25
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,060
 It didn't matter what it was.

26
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,260
 Like, "Thou shall honor your father and mother."

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,900
 Well, that sounds like more of a suggestion.

28
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,760
 I don't know how you read it,

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,760
 but it sounds like, you know, maybe it's a suggestion.

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,820
 You know, "Thou shall not get drunk with wine."

31
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,300
 Good thing I'm a beer guy.

32
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,180
 (congregation laughing)

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,580
 Easy, all right?

34
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,220
 You know, "Thou shall not commit adultery."

35
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,660
 I'm not an adult.

36
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,740
 (congregation laughing)

37
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,020
 I'm gonna do whatever I want with whoever I want.

38
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,100
 And so that's kinda the way I was rolling through life

39
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,620
 all the way up to and including some of young adulthood.

40
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,660
 And by the grace of God, I became a believer in Christ

41
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,100
 and I started to entrust more and more of my life

42
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,060
 over to Him.

43
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,340
 And now after almost a full decade of following Christ

44
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,340
 and trying consciously to let Him have every bit,

45
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,980
 100% of my heart,

46
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,640
 I am convinced that the reason I thought that way

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,220
 is not because I didn't understand the commands themselves,

48
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,320
 but it was because I did not understand

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,360
 the full context behind them.

50
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,320
 I'm gonna say that again.

51
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,340
 I believe that I rejected the commands of God,

52
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,760
 not because I didn't understand them,

53
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,520
 but because I simply didn't get the full context,

54
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,340
 the full purpose, the full reason,

55
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,080
 the full heart of God behind the command,

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,300
 the reason for the rule or the belief behind the behavior.

57
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,400
 I completely missed it.

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,600
 I had no idea.

59
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,040
 And so nobody likes commands without context.

60
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,520
 Can we just agree that nobody likes commands without context?

61
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,760
 This is why some of you right now

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,420
 are frustrated with your boss,

63
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,960
 because they dropped by

64
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,000
 and they said something that sounds like this.

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,480
 Well, corporate's doing a restructure

66
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,180
 and there's gonna be a new rollout

67
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,720
 and basically a lot has changed

68
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,300
 and here are the new commands.

69
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,880
 And you lean forward like, okay, what's the why?

70
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,320
 And then they walk off.

71
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,400
 And you're like, oh, I guess I'm just supposed to trust it.

72
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,040
 This is not the dumbest idea ever.

73
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,240
 All right, and now my whole world has changed

74
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,400
 and there's no context.

75
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
 There's no why.

76
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,220
 There's no purpose.

77
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,680
 You're just like, wow, must be nice.

78
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,360
 And this is what we all experienced it.

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,560
 Every single one of us experienced with our parents,

80
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,600
 because there are four little words

81
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,240
 that are given to every English speaking parent in the world

82
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,680
 and they are the words when you ask why they say.

83
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,800
 We're all related somehow.

84
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,760
 All of our parents raised us the exact same way.

85
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,560
 Because I said so.

86
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,640
 It's like, really?

87
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,160
 I mean, going, looking back, you're like, okay, first off,

88
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,800
 thank you for reasoning in a circle.

89
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,200
 Second off, restatement of your point

90
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,720
 is not an explanation of your point.

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,320
 But you can't say all that when you're four.

92
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,600
 So you just take it, all right?

93
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,140
 And so that's the way it's like when you grow up,

94
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,000
 you just get the command and you have no context.

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,960
 And a command without context is really just a demand.

96
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,140
 And nobody likes demands.

97
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,440
 I know that about you, I know it about me.

98
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,560
 Nobody likes demands.

99
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,160
 We don't like commands without context.

100
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,720
 And worst of all, you might've got this from church

101
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,760
 when you were younger.

102
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,000
 I did.

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,040
 It was like, don't run.

104
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,240
 Don't run to church.

105
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,080
 Why not?

106
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,480
 Just don't run.

107
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,640
 Be nice to people at church.

108
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,800
 These people aren't even nice.

109
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,940
 It doesn't matter, just be nice.

110
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,220
 I mean, there's no purpose.

111
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,240
 There's no purpose given at all.

112
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,560
 And unfortunately, even Christians ourselves

113
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,280
 sometimes cause this misunderstanding.

114
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,120
 And here's why.

115
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,240
 It is easier to find a Christian giving commands

116
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,960
 than it is to find a Christian who's giving context.

117
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,920
 You know what I mean by that?

118
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,840
 It's easier to find a Christian in public or in culture

119
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,860
 or in politics or at work or at class

120
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,840
 or just in your friend group.

121
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,440
 It's easier to find a Christian

122
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
 who is all about giving the commands of God.

123
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,600
 You know, it's almost like they kind of

124
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,000
 are on patrol all the time.

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,220
 And it's like, hey, don't do that.

126
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,060
 Don't drink that.

127
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,880
 Don't smoke that.

128
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,720
 Don't touch her.

129
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,080
 Don't even like her, you know, in fact.

130
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,800
 And so it's really easy to find a Christian

131
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,760
 who is the moral police, okay?

132
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,640
 But it is hard to find a Christian

133
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,760
 who is proposing instead of imposing

134
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,700
 a relationship with God, the heart of God,

135
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,560
 the context of all the commands.

136
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,480
 And as we launch into this brand new series

137
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,400
 called "Thou Shalt," it is indeed on the 10 most famous

138
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,680
 thou shalts and thou shalt nots in all of history.

139
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,680
 And what we don't wanna do is we are unwilling to risk

140
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,240
 that you might walk away and you might think,

141
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,500
 you know what, God is more about commands and demands

142
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,760
 than he is about context.

143
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,240
 God is somehow more about just giving rules

144
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,740
 than he is about giving reasons.

145
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,360
 God is somehow all about just moral behavior

146
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,300
 and he has nothing to do with belief.

147
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,720
 And we are not willing to stand up and spend a few weeks

148
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,640
 giving you these thou shalts without investing

149
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,880
 really strongly in the context that they came in

150
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,360
 and what they mean for us.

151
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,560
 So get ready, we're gonna spend our entire evening

152
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,820
 on the single sentence before the 10 commandments.

153
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,520
 So if you have never spent an entire sermon,

154
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,500
 half an hour on one sentence, today's your day, all right?

155
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,020
 So we are gonna look very closely at one sentence,

156
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,000
 the sentence before the 10 commandments.

157
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,880
 Nobody knows the sentence before the 10 commandments.

158
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,660
 That's like no one who baths before Babe Ruth.

159
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,040
 Nobody knows who baths before Babe Ruth,

160
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,880
 they know Babe Ruth.

161
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,660
 And so we are gonna actually look at the sentence

162
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,080
 right before the big commandments

163
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,240
 because we want you to see three crucial pieces of context

164
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,720
 that come before these commands.

165
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,920
 Because context matters big time and it matters to God.

166
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,880
 So what we're gonna do is we're gonna go

167
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,200
 to Exodus chapter 20.

168
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,600
 So Exodus would be the second book of your Bible,

169
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,760
 Genesis, Exodus, you don't have to go very far.

170
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
 Just start at the far left and start turning right,

171
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,980
 you'll get there pretty quickly.

172
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,120
 Exodus chapter 20, and we're gonna look at verses one

173
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,880
 and two, verses one and two, just make up one single sentence

174
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,520
 but before we go there, I want you to know a little bit

175
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,720
 about the story of what was going on.

176
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,360
 So it pleased God to create a perfect world

177
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,800
 which fell later into imperfection and chaos.

178
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,440
 And he decided to redeem that world by creating a family

179
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,600
 that would turn into a nation that would produce a savior

180
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,000
 of the whole world and that of course is Jesus.

181
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,380
 But that's 1500 years after this passage

182
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,360
 that we're looking at right now.

183
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,880
 Exodus chapter 20, experts are somewhere between 1446 BC

184
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,640
 and 1276 BC, not important, you just need to know

185
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,360
 it's a long time before Jesus.

186
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,160
 All right, and so God is in the middle of launching

187
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,000
 this redemptive plan for all of history.

188
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,940
 And Israel is on the verge of becoming

189
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,320
 for the very first time its own nation.

190
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,840
 So Israel had been just a family, started with Abraham,

191
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,520
 Isaac, Jacob and Joseph, if those names are familiar,

192
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,020
 and the family grew and grew and grew

193
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,080
 and they went to Egypt.

194
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,080
 Well, they continued to multiply in Egypt

195
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,280
 until finally the leadership changed of Egypt

196
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,460
 and instead of it being a friendly place to visit,

197
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,760
 they were oppressed and they were enslaved.

198
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,760
 And God led them out of slavery.

199
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,360
 And were on the verge, at this time,

200
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,120
 they were on the verge of having land

201
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
 for the very first time.

202
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,540
 That's why the book is called Exodus.

203
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,320
 It is the exit of them from Egypt.

204
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,180
 All right, so as they are preparing for the very first time

205
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,920
 to go into the promised land, if you've heard that phrase,

206
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,560
 that's where it comes from, they are on the way,

207
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,120
 they are in route to the promised land

208
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,720
 and God looks forward and says,

209
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,120
 these guys are gonna need some instruction

210
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,240
 before they get there.

211
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,800
 And that's why God gave the law,

212
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,080
 the most famous section of which is the 10 thou shalls.

213
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,060
 So that's where we are

214
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,800
 and we're gonna go six words in right now.

215
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,640
 Are you ready?

216
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,600
 Here it comes, Exodus chapter 20, verse one.

217
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,480
 And God spoke all these words.

218
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,400
 Let's close in prayer.

219
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,240
 I'm just kidding.

220
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,200
 (congregation laughing)

221
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,440
 And God spoke all these words.

222
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,880
 Now think about this.

223
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,400
 These words matter so much

224
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,080
 because of where they are in the story.

225
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,320
 You're in the 70th chapter of the Bible.

226
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,240
 So Genesis has 50 chapters

227
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,480
 and Exodus has 19 prior to this.

228
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,120
 Think about, do a little flyby with me

229
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,500
 about what the previous 69 chapters of the Bible involved.

230
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,400
 You've got God creating a perfect world,

231
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,160
 free of any hardship at all,

232
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,040
 free of death, free of any of that.

233
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,520
 And people begin to immediately break God's law

234
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,480
 and we break this world completely.

235
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,620
 Death comes in, sickness comes in,

236
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,680
 shame comes in, guilt comes in.

237
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,800
 All the things that you struggle with today

238
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,080
 have at least their beginnings then.

239
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,960
 And just one generation later,

240
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,720
 the sons of the very first parents

241
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,560
 actually murder each other.

242
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,360
 One murders the other, I should say.

243
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,520
 After that, we get the first serial murderer,

244
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,200
 not long after that.

245
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,420
 And then we get people sleeping around

246
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,640
 with each other immediately.

247
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,920
 And then on top of that, you get people who decide,

248
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
 you know what, I wanna worship something,

249
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,200
 I'll just worship some tree,

250
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,680
 or I'll worship the ground, or I'll worship the sun,

251
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,920
 or I'll worship some golden thing that represents a bird.

252
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,880
 And so there is total spiritual confusion.

253
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,060
 And God who had reached out all along the way,

254
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,020
 just read these other 69 chapters anytime you want to,

255
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,280
 you'll find God persistently, persistently

256
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,960
 trying to reach out to humanity,

257
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,000
 trying to reach out to us, to have a relationship with us.

258
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,320
 And he would have had every legitimate reason

259
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,160
 to no longer reach out to us.

260
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,680
 Which is why you wanna thank God that he's not like you.

261
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,760
 Because we do things like this,

262
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,200
 well, if you're not into me, I'm not into you.

263
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,800
 That's the kind of stuff we do.

264
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,720
 But God says, you know what,

265
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,280
 no matter how far you go from me,

266
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,720
 I am gonna continue to reach out to you.

267
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,760
 And it says, and God spoke all these words.

268
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,320
 That's a miracle in and of itself.

269
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,160
 It's the grace of God

270
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,900
 that he would even decide to speak to us.

271
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,220
 Here's a thought you didn't have

272
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,480
 on the way to work probably.

273
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,120
 What if that hadn't happened?

274
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,360
 What would the world be like?

275
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,560
 What kind of chaos, there's the hint,

276
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,960
 chaos would have ensued if God hadn't spoken these words?

277
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,560
 What if there was no governance?

278
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,400
 I mean, what if that happened?

279
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,380
 As Americans, for some reason, that sounds good to us.

280
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,040
 We have some really misguided ideas about law and freedom.

281
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,520
 Sometimes people say things they don't think about,

282
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,620
 like, oh, what if there was no law?

283
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,460
 Wouldn't that be cool?

284
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,480
 Oh no, that would not be cool.

285
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,400
 You do not think about what you just said.

286
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,040
 Drive in a third world country

287
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,000
 and find out how much you miss the law.

288
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,160
 It is absolute chaos.

289
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,400
 And the truth is, is without God stepping in

290
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,840
 to provide some kind of structure,

291
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,840
 it would have resulted in complete

292
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,760
 and utter moral depravity.

293
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,900
 Now here's a quote from Clay Christensen

294
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,840
 at Harvard Business School.

295
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,960
 All right, not Watermark staff, not a church,

296
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,700
 not the seminary, not Christianity Today, Harvard.

297
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,200
 "If you get rid of religion,

298
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,800
 "you won't be able to hire enough police."

299
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,600
 End quote.

300
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,880
 Just today in New York City, more chaos.

301
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,160
 A man, if you haven't seen it,

302
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,400
 a man drove a truck in an act of terror

303
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,200
 and killed eight people on the streets of New York City.

304
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
 That just happened today.

305
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,100
 I was here four, five, six weeks ago,

306
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,940
 and then that was the week of the Las Vegas incident.

307
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,000
 There's constant chaos in the world.

308
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,320
 If God doesn't even restrain a little,

309
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,480
 and if he hadn't spoken up,

310
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,640
 our semi-safe lives would not even be semi-safe.

311
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,720
 And so why would he do it?

312
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,440
 Just commitment to us.

313
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,080
 So the first piece of context you're gonna want

314
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,440
 to remember, any thou shalls that you're gonna hear,

315
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,040
 you're gonna wanna know God's commands

316
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,640
 prove God's commitment to us.

317
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,120
 God's commands prove God's commitment to us.

318
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,240
 This is so huge if you had a dad who checked out on you,

319
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,360
 because God doesn't give up.

320
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,640
 He leans in.

321
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,520
 I wanna tell you a little story about my family.

322
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,960
 I had a really strong, I have currently,

323
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,960
 a really strong command-type dad, world-class dad.

324
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,880
 And I have a little brother who was the worst toddler

325
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
 in the history of all of toddlerdom.

326
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,960
 He was rough.

327
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,520
 I'm talking about some unbelievable willpower.

328
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,080
 I'm talking about like, hey, don't do that.

329
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,200
 And then he does it while making eye contact.

330
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,920
 Like, I dare you, you know?

331
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,200
 And then the promised discipline comes,

332
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,120
 and then he does it again, just tears of anger.

333
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,120
 Not even tears of pain, just like anger.

334
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,080
 My father would point at him sometimes, you know,

335
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,760
 to get his attention, and it's like, hey,

336
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,600
 you better do that.

337
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,360
 And he would ball up his little fist and point back.

338
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,160
 But he couldn't straighten out his finger.

339
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,400
 And so he would just look back at dad

340
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,480
 with a little claw like this.

341
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,400
 And he would point right back at him,

342
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,800
 just completely fearless.

343
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,320
 So, you know, the car seat is designed

344
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,920
 to keep a three-year-old or a two-year-old safe,

345
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,760
 a kid safe.

346
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,760
 And my dad had to drive with one hand on the wheel

347
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,960
 and one hand on the car seat

348
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,880
 with him punching the hand and the wrist.

349
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,440
 And he would just make himself tired

350
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,280
 punching the hand and the wrist.

351
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,240
 He didn't have a demon to our knowledge, but it was weird.

352
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,960
 And so he just would go and go and go.

353
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,160
 And then eventually one day,

354
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,600
 this light bulb goes off in his head,

355
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,560
 and you could just see him think.

356
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,760
 And then he just spits all over his hand and says,

357
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,600
 "Your move."

358
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,440
 And he looks at him like, "Your move."

359
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,280
 Wow.

360
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,760
 And so this is the kind of dude we're talking about.

361
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,680
 I'm gonna tell you one more story just

362
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,800
 'cause I can't resist.

363
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,200
 (congregation laughing)

364
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,520
 One time he was three and a half, maybe four.

365
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,360
 We're eight years apart.

366
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,440
 So this is how I have memories of this.

367
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,280
 I was 12.

368
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,720
 And so he was three and a half,

369
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,680
 and afraid of my dad more than him.

370
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,200
 And so he's about three and a half, four,

371
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,240
 somewhere through there.

372
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,320
 And my dad and I were at my grandparents' house,

373
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,280
 but he and his mom, divorced parents,

374
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,240
 so he has a different mom.

375
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,440
 So he and his mom were home

376
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,360
 and dad and I were out at our grandparents' house.

377
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,880
 And Wade, my little brother,

378
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,080
 has thrown his Game Boy at his mom,

379
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,880
 which was just kind of normal occurrence.

380
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,680
 Thanks for gasping, but I mean, it was just pretty,

381
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,680
 it was kind of normal, you know?

382
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,800
 And so my dad gets him on the phone and he says,

383
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,360
 "Hey, I heard you threw your Game Boy at your mom."

384
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
 And he said, "Yeah."

385
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,600
 And he said, "Well, how about I take your Game Boy away?

386
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,440
 "How about that?"

387
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,280
 That's what dad said.

388
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,000
 And Wade says immediately, "How about I kick your butt?

389
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,840
 "How about that?"

390
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,680
 (congregation laughing)

391
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,600
 That's the kind of normal, that's normal.

392
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,880
 I don't know where he learned it, wasn't me?

393
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,000
 Okay, so he, this is just kind of what's going on

394
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,840
 in our house.

395
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,800
 Now, I could tell you more.

396
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,080
 I guarantee you, when we get together for Thanksgiving

397
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,400
 in four weeks, this is gonna come up.

398
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,720
 We just go through them all because it's so entertaining.

399
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,160
 You'd be glad to know he's a functional member

400
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,080
 of society today.

401
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,000
 It all went away.

402
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,160
 He's on scholarship playing baseball

403
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,320
 at University of New Orleans.

404
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,160
 It's super exciting.

405
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,000
 We're really proud of him.

406
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,520
 He's a great guy, but it took some work.

407
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,760
 All right, and so listen, my dad, like think about this.

408
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,000
 Think about what if you're dad?

409
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,480
 Like what if you're dad?

410
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,540
 A dad has a choice at this point, okay?

411
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,020
 You can check out completely.

412
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,040
 That would make you absent dad.

413
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,960
 You could just go hands off and laugh about it

414
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,920
 and hope he grows out of it,

415
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,280
 which is to say you could be passive dad.

416
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,480
 You could get mad and over discipline, you know,

417
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,360
 and spank him too hard and blah, blah, blah.

418
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,060
 And you could do all that and then you'd be angry dad.

419
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:58,080
 Or you could persistently give kindhearted commands

420
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,560
 and you'd be a loving dad.

421
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,120
 This is the heart of God.

422
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,840
 He loves us even in our rebellion

423
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,160
 that is way more toddler-like than we think.

424
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,880
 And he leans forward into us

425
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,440
 and he doesn't stop giving structure to our lives

426
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,800
 because we need it.

427
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,280
 The 10 commandments are not an expression of control.

428
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,040
 The words thou shall are not an expression of control.

429
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,600
 You need to know that.

430
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,520
 It's God's commitment to you.

431
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,080
 That's why they're there,

432
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,720
 because he is committed to you

433
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,120
 and he's committed to your good.

434
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,960
 Six words.

435
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,780
 All right, let's keep going.

436
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,280
 Verse one, "And God spoke all these words,

437
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,280
 "saying, 'I am the Lord, your God.'"

438
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,960
 Whose God?

439
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,280
 Your God.

440
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,880
 I'm your God, you're my people.

441
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,420
 There's a relationship here.

442
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,680
 You see, I'm not just speaking this randomly.

443
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,320
 I'm saying this to people I know

444
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,700
 and that people who know me.

445
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,840
 I am the Lord, your God.

446
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,840
 The commands are going to his people,

447
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,280
 people who know him,

448
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,200
 people who know that he's committed to them,

449
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,000
 and people who are ready to obey.

450
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,320
 Not just the I'm the Lord and I'm in charge.

451
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,040
 I'm the Lord and I'm your God.

452
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,560
 You belong to me and I belong to you.

453
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,200
 It's relational.

454
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,040
 Everybody was taught this when you were a kid.

455
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,100
 Everybody knows.

456
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,580
 You obey people you know.

457
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,200
 Mom, dad, teacher, yes.

458
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,720
 Man with beard and candy and white van, no.

459
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,440
 We don't know him, so we don't obey him.

460
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,000
 But it says the Lord, your God,

461
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,080
 meaning everything I'm about to tell you

462
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,900
 is spoken within the context of an existing relationship.

463
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,120
 The commands I'm about to give you

464
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,680
 are not going to create a relationship.

465
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,560
 We're already in one.

466
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,460
 So the second piece of context that you're gonna want

467
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:49,120
 for the 10 commandments is that God gives commands to us

468
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,480
 after he has started a relationship with us.

469
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,280
 Relationship first, then commands.

470
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,660
 Always, even in the 10 commandments.

471
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,560
 Relationship first, and then obedience.

472
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,400
 Relationship, then obedience.

473
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,580
 This is huge because it means for us

474
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,080
 that you can't get into a relationship with God

475
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,680
 by obeying commands.

476
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,120
 You can only maintain a relationship with God

477
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,320
 by obeying commands.

478
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,940
 All you can do is keep fellowship with God.

479
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,800
 You can't create an initial fellowship with God.

480
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,960
 It is impossible.

481
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,880
 You cannot do it.

482
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,880
 And if you're like, oh, really, are you sure?

483
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,680
 Let's get Jesus' thoughts on the subject.

484
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,520
 I would love to do that.

485
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,760
 Check this out in John chapter 14.

486
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,800
 This is fast forward 1,500 years.

487
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,840
 Listen to this, the way Jesus captures this.

488
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,560
 If you love me, that's a relationship,

489
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,520
 you will keep my commandments.

490
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,840
 That's obedience.

491
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,120
 If you love me, if there's a relationship here,

492
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,860
 if there's a real relationship here,

493
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,720
 then you are going to keep my commandments.

494
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,520
 As a natural outworking of that relationship.

495
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,360
 If you love me, you'll keep my commandments.

496
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,080
 Now, there are two mistakes that people try to make

497
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,820
 with this principle.

498
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,800
 That relationship comes first and then obedience.

499
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,760
 Here are the two mistakes.

500
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,680
 They get the order wrong.

501
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,200
 And so they think, I am gonna be so obedient

502
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,520
 that somehow God is going to love me.

503
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,920
 I am gonna clean myself up.

504
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,420
 I am gonna stop sleeping around.

505
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,540
 I have had it with him.

506
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,500
 I'm breaking up with him.

507
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,560
 I knew I should have done it.

508
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,640
 And I am gonna start listening to my friends

509
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,360
 and I'm gonna start reading the Bible.

510
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
 And it's just gonna be different from here on out.

511
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,040
 And then God will be pleased with me enough at least.

512
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,320
 I'll meet him in the middle and we'll have a relationship.

513
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,720
 Okay, this is just something natural we do as people

514
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,960
 is we think we're gonna obey our way

515
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,500
 into a relationship with God.

516
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,200
 That's a mistake because the Bible says

517
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,920
 that a relationship with God is based on grace.

518
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,560
 That is a gift from him to you through faith,

519
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,760
 which means you trust him, you depend on him,

520
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,920
 you rely on him and then the obedience comes afterward.

521
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,320
 You can't obey your way into a relationship with God.

522
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,040
 You trust your way into a relationship with God.

523
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,920
 And so that's the first error is people try to obey

524
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,720
 and they think that will win them a relationship.

525
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,480
 The other mistake people commonly make,

526
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,480
 this is increasingly common, I'm sad to say,

527
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,800
 is that people just leave off the whole obedience part.

528
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,000
 It's like, I've got a relationship with God

529
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,240
 and I don't need to do anything else.

530
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,720
 Therefore, there's no commandments, freedom in Christ.

531
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,220
 And so people say, you know what?

532
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,620
 I've got this relationship with God and so I love him.

533
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,560
 And so, you know what?

534
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,000
 Let's not get all legalistic buzzword about it.

535
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,840
 You know what?

536
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,080
 Let's not get all uptight and mechanical about it.

537
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,240
 I've got a relationship with God, so why obey?

538
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,920
 And I'm telling you, you might want to discern

539
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,120
 whether or not you love Jesus the way you think you do

540
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,880
 because he says right here,

541
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,480
 if you love me, you will obey my commandments.

542
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,200
 Not if you love me, you will find ways to talk yourself out

543
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,720
 of my commandments and claim freedom in Christ.

544
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,720
 It says, if you love me, you'll keep my commandments.

545
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,800
 Relationship and then obedience.

546
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,960
 Start to finish in your Bible, it's amazing.

547
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,960
 And God is saying, I give you this law.

548
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,220
 I give you these commandments

549
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,880
 to govern our existing relationship.

550
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,220
 Now, there's one piece of cleanup I need to do on this.

551
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,040
 The truth is, you're in a relationship with God

552
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,880
 whether you want to be or not

553
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,120
 because he created you and that's the way it works.

554
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,700
 You know, you don't get to pick your mom,

555
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,160
 you don't get to pick your dad.

556
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,240
 You can pretend, but you don't get to pick your God either.

557
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,520
 Not really.

558
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,720
 There's one God who created you.

559
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,120
 And by the way, being an atheist or denying God

560
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,840
 or denying the scripture actually is not an exemption

561
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,920
 from the 10 commandments because the government

562
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,220
 thinks some of these are important.

563
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,720
 Like thou shalt not kill.

564
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,120
 I mean, can you imagine killing someone

565
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,980
 and telling the judge, no, I'm an atheist, man.

566
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,520
 I don't do the 10 commandments.

567
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,240
 That's not gonna work.

568
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,240
 The government will put you in adult timeout.

569
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,280
 If you steal or if you kill people,

570
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,180
 you will actually be secluded from society.

571
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,480
 That's the way this works.

572
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,620
 And so I'm not saying that you are only in a relationship

573
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,760
 with God totally if you choose to be.

574
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,720
 Of course, you've gotta opt in and give your trust to him

575
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,240
 and that's a choice that only you can make.

576
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,000
 I'm saying you get to decide whether you wanna be

577
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 in a rebellious relationship with him

578
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,880
 or a cooperative relationship with him.

579
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,200
 And if you decide to be in a cooperative relationship

580
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,960
 with him, then these commands especially

581
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,520
 are there to help you flourish.

582
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,240
 All right.

583
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,220
 Verse one, again.

584
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,400
 And God spoke all these words,

585
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,400
 saying, "I am the Lord your God,"

586
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,760
 and then the last bit, "who brought you out of Egypt,

587
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,580
 "out of the house of slavery."

588
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,400
 Hello, you think there's some context?

589
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,560
 Out of the house of slavery.

590
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,980
 You are here because I freed you.

591
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,440
 The only reason you're even here,

592
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,060
 the only reason we're having this conversation

593
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,280
 is because you prayed to me

594
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,240
 and despite everything wrong you'd ever done,

595
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,920
 I chose to answer you and so now consequently, you're free.

596
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,560
 You exist in a state of freedom.

597
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,440
 You've already started to complain about it,

598
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,200
 but you exist right now in a state of complete freedom.

599
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,880
 And the word slavery right here signals to us as we read

600
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,520
 that every one of these commands is a ticket to freedom.

601
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,440
 Every one of these commands is a way to stay free.

602
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,240
 The reason God, why would God mention the past like this?

603
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,000
 Oh God, you know, don't mention the past.

604
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,500
 Why would he mention the past?

605
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,800
 Because he's saying the slavery of the past is no more

606
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,600
 and what I'm about to tell you right now

607
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,140
 is the way to stay free.

608
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,900
 Thou shalt not commit adultery in order to stay free.

609
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,880
 Thou shalt rest once a week in order to stay free.

610
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,360
 Thou shalt not covet each other's wives

611
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,460
 or husbands or houses in order to stay free.

612
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,760
 That's the spirit behind these commandments.

613
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,920
 That's a huge, huge distinction.

614
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,600
 So the third piece of context you'll want tonight

615
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,040
 before we keep going in the series later

616
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,780
 is that God's commands are given to preserve freedom.

617
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,640
 How good is God?

618
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,120
 God's commandments are given to preserve freedom.

619
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
 It's not 10 commandments because I said so.

620
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,040
 It's not Bible because I said so.

621
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,760
 It's 10 commandments because I want you to be free.

622
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,320
 I want you to stay free.

623
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,720
 I gave you a gift and I want you to preserve it.

624
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,760
 And ironically, ironically, we believe,

625
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,360
 we believe that God's commandments

626
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,260
 actually reduce our freedom.

627
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,520
 How bizarre and insane is that?

628
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,520
 We actually think that if we adopt the commands of God,

629
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,580
 that we're somehow gonna be the ones who miss out.

630
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,760
 Like if we do these thou shalts and thou shalt nots,

631
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,280
 we're gonna have less life instead of more.

632
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,360
 We're gonna have less freedom instead of more.

633
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
 But here's the curve ball.

634
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,840
 If you're sitting there thinking,

635
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,320
 oh, if I follow the commands of God,

636
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,660
 I don't get to have my sex or I don't get to have my stuff

637
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,560
 or I don't get to have my relationship.

638
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,680
 You don't even realize that the relationship

639
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,160
 or the sex or the stuff has you.

640
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,000
 You are currently not free.

641
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,580
 Listen to what Jesus says, John chapter eight.

642
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,280
 "Truly, truly, I say to you,

643
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,280
 "everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin."

644
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,600
 That means if you think your favorite sin expression,

645
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,540
 whatever it is, you pick it.

646
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,100
 Self-obsession, chasing money, you pick.

647
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,240
 If you think your favorite sin expression

648
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,480
 is a ticket to freedom,

649
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,040
 you are actually already enslaved to it.

650
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,880
 I experienced this.

651
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,360
 Pornography for me was just a world of curiosity

652
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,400
 when I was 14.

653
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,240
 But when I was 21, it was a world of bondage.

654
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,840
 I started to practice sin and I became a slave to sin.

655
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,720
 It started to own me.

656
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,240
 And I might've even told you I was free, but I wasn't.

657
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,480
 I started to practice, but then I got caught.

658
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,080
 See, that's the way it always works.

659
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,640
 So this happens when you like,

660
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,160
 if you might notice this happening,

661
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,640
 if you drink wine socially,

662
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,520
 but then all of a sudden you're drinking wine solutionally.

663
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,360
 Like now it's a solution.

664
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,480
 Like instead of like, oh, you know what?

665
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,200
 People like me better and the jokes are funnier.

666
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,000
 And I'm gonna have a glass of wine at this thing.

667
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,400
 Now, all of a sudden, you gotta have a glass of wine

668
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,560
 every time you come home from work

669
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,760
 and you find yourself looking forward to it.

670
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,020
 And all of a sudden it's gone from a social thing

671
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,120
 to a solution thing.

672
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,600
 Something broke you.

673
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,660
 And you're not as free as you think you are.

674
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,140
 This happens in relationships.

675
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,100
 That happens between people.

676
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,420
 You get into a relationship and it starts to go good.

677
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,900
 And you're like, oh man, this is like,

678
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,660
 this is a serious option for the rest of my life.

679
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,300
 I mean, I'm like, we are thinking about this.

680
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,460
 This is getting serious.

681
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,140
 And then all of a sudden you start sleeping together

682
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,660
 and they become the focal point of your entire life

683
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,560
 where you can't even imagine life without them.

684
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,500
 No matter how bad they treat you,

685
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,120
 no matter how much your mama doesn't like him or her,

686
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,520
 no matter how much the friends around you are saying

687
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,460
 that this is alarming and not the right relationship.

688
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,620
 And all of a sudden you find yourself

689
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,620
 enduring all kinds of abuse and hardship

690
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,900
 and weirdness and drama.

691
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,240
 And the option for you to put down the relationship is gone.

692
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,140
 You've lost freedom because you started to practice sin.

693
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,980
 That's the way it always works.

694
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,860
 Everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin.

695
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,460
 But praise God, two verses later he says,

696
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,360
 "If the Son of God sets you free, you'll be free indeed."

697
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:58,720
 So in summary, God's commands prove God's commitment to us.

698
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,140
 God gives commands to us

699
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,220
 after he has started a relationship with us.

700
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,140
 And thirdly, God's commands are given

701
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,020
 to preserve our freedom.

702
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,660
 I'd love to close by telling you a story this evening.

703
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,320
 So there came a time in my life that was pretty rough.

704
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,380
 I'd call it kind of the low point.

705
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,360
 I was pretty young, so it's hard to call it the low point,

706
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,200
 but I know that it was.

707
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,220
 I was an early teenager.

708
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,940
 And I told you my parents were divorced

709
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,140
 and they had been since before I even had a memory.

710
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,980
 And I was living with my mom

711
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,340
 and I basically got into junior high

712
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,340
 and decided I wanted to overrule my mom

713
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,580
 and I just wanted to be a thug.

714
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,020
 And so I started smoking weed.

715
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,260
 I know that's crazy.

716
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,380
 And so, but I started smoking weed.

717
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,940
 I ran from the police, almost got arrested,

718
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,340
 stole my mom's car to go joyriding.

719
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,840
 I was sleeping around already

720
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,460
 and I was just not a nice kid.

721
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,820
 I was not a good guy.

722
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,740
 And you look back at that and you think,

723
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,700
 "Ah, it was kid stuff."

724
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,540
 It wasn't, man.

725
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,200
 I was guilty and I knew it.

726
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,380
 And the situation really came apart for me.

727
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,300
 Started failing out of school, no lie.

728
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,900
 And then the situation really fell apart.

729
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,460
 My mom married the wrong dude

730
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,420
 and there was a domestic violence situation

731
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,480
 that was kind of ongoing for about six months.

732
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,700
 And I was put in some pretty tough positions.

733
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,120
 And this guy put my mom in the hospital twice.

734
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,620
 So that's what it was like in the house

735
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,980
 for a brief period of time.

736
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,900
 Thankfully, my mom knew that she was valuable enough

737
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,020
 to extract herself from that situation

738
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,900
 and to move the kids out.

739
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,100
 So we did, but it was really, really, really hard.

740
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,340
 And in the midst of that, I sat down

741
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,180
 and I started thinking,

742
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,660
 "You know, I do have another option

743
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,940
 now that mom's out, mom's safe.

744
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,080
 I mean, I could go live with dad with all his rules."

745
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,180
 And I started to think about it.

746
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,140
 Like, do I really want, you know?

747
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,060
 I was a punk and I knew it.

748
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,380
 I had an older brother who was a few years down the road,

749
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,220
 farther down this road

750
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,700
 and he was reaping even more destruction.

751
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,740
 And I thought, "You know what?

752
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,900
 I wonder if I should go live with dad."

753
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,780
 And I started to think about it, kind of weigh my options.

754
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,060
 Hmm, is the law worth it?

755
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,780
 Is it worth it to get all the commands?

756
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,740
 'Cause he was a tight dad.

757
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,460
 I mean, he was ruling with a tight fist.

758
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,940
 Was it worth it?

759
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,440
 And I started replaying memories from my whole life.

760
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,060
 And I noticed that every time he spanked me,

761
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,600
 he always explained before and he hugged after.

762
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,300
 And I noticed that after every little league game,

763
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,020
 win, lose, play bad, play good,

764
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,580
 he was always telling me he loved me

765
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,300
 and that it was enough.

766
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,940
 And that every time he pushed me really hard,

767
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,100
 he would tell me that he loved me no matter what.

768
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,540
 He always called, he always wrote,

769
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,780
 he never broke a promise.

770
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,500
 And he did all this from miles and miles and miles away.

771
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,020
 I got birthday cakes every time I went over to his house.

772
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,860
 I'd already had a birthday party,

773
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,380
 it didn't matter, dad's buying a birthday cake.

774
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,180
 So it was constant.

775
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,900
 I thought, I grew up thinking, this is crazy now knowing,

776
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,420
 but I grew up thinking that 20-somethings

777
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,900
 had nothing better to do than drive to East Texas

778
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,940
 from DFW to hang out with their T-baller.

779
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,060
 Like I thought that that's what 20-somethings did.

780
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,400
 They just drive all over Texas

781
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,380
 to hang out with their four-year-old or their five-year-old

782
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,980
 or their eight-year-old because that's what my dad did.

783
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,260
 I was so convinced.

784
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,940
 And so as I weighed my options

785
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,180
 of all the chaos that was outside of me

786
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,700
 as an early teenager and all the chaos I knew

787
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,740
 was inside of me,

788
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,860
 I could see the heart behind my father's discipline.

789
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,760
 And I chose to move in with him.

790
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,220
 And I knew when I got there,

791
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,100
 his controlling hands were gonna come on in

792
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,520
 and it was gonna be like, the law has come to town.

793
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,260
 Sure enough, here's our first conversation.

794
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,100
 Hey, if you act like a thug,

795
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,220
 I'm gonna send you back to East Texas.

796
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,980
 Okay, got it, knew that was coming.

797
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,100
 And so he was a firm dad,

798
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,340
 but I knew the intent of his heart.

799
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,340
 I knew that Hebrews 12, six,

800
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,760
 that God disciplines those he loves

801
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,500
 was part of my dad's heart.

802
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,420
 It was his heart.

803
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,340
 And it made it easy to move in closer to him.

804
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,940
 My dad and I have an amazing relationship to this day.

805
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,460
 And so what I wanna tell you is,

806
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:50,820
 if you can see the heart behind the commands of God,

807
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,460
 you will be attracted.

808
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,340
 You will move closer.

809
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,160
 If you know it's not just control

810
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,400
 and it's not just limiting freedom,

811
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,140
 it's not, as we say, trying to rip you off,

812
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,900
 but it really is trying to set you free.

813
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,620
 If you can see that, then you will move closer to God.

814
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,460
 We won't be able to keep you away

815
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,500
 because you'll see his heart

816
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,820
 and you'll know what he intends for you.

817
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,740
 And when you feel those commands of the Bible,

818
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,300
 there's no secret, there's commands in the Bible.

819
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,740
 Of course there's commands in the Bible.

820
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,700
 But when you feel those bump up against you

821
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,300
 and demand a change from you

822
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,980
 or demand a sacrifice from you,

823
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,300
 all of a sudden you will like it

824
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,460
 because you know it's a father forming you.

825
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:35,100
 Romans 8 says that he's bringing us all into his image.

826
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,700
 He predestined us to be conformed into the image of Christ.

827
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,660
 That means that every command of God is for your good

828
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,980
 so that you will look like Christ

829
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,660
 and you will stay free from whatever Egypt

830
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,420
 he brought you out of.

831
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,460
 That's the goodness of God.

832
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,300
 But if you can't see that,

833
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,460
 you'll stay away and you'll be suspicious.

834
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,360
 And you'll think, I'm not gonna give my life to God.

835
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,740
 But if you can see the heart,

836
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,800
 if you can see the context behind the command,

837
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,900
 which is why we wanted to invest an entire night

838
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,540
 in one sentence, because we know

839
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,420
 if you can see the heart behind the command,

840
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,100
 you'll come closer, just like we all do.

841
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,300
 Let's pray together.

842
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:18,080
 Thank you, Father in heaven,

843
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,180
 that you saw fit to speak to us

844
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,060
 even when we were undeserving,

845
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,580
 even when we had turned our back on you

846
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,340
 in every way imaginable,

847
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,780
 when we suspected you that your commands

848
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,420
 would just make us uncreative,

849
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,120
 when we thought that your commands would make us bored,

850
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,780
 when we thought that your commands would lead to less life,

851
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,540
 you still pressed forward and you still pursued us.

852
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,620
 Thank you, God, that you saw fit to do that.

853
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,740
 God, help us to see that you discipline those whom you love.

854
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,440
 Help us to sing just like David did,

855
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,800
 things we thought we would never sing,

856
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,400
 like we love your law, we meditate on your law,

857
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
 day and night, oh, how we love your statutes,

858
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,440
 sweeter than honey.

859
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,520
 Give us a heart to see, God.

860
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,560
 Give us eyes to see past the thou shall

861
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,560
 and help us not be suspicious of your mouth that speaks it.

862
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,640
 Because you're trying to have a relationship with us.

863
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,760
 You're trying to keep us free.

864
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,760
 The only reason you ever regulate life is to make it better.

865
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,300
 Teach us to believe it, God.

866
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,220
 In Jesus' name, Amen.
