[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.240]   Cut.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.520]   Just don't put it on your face.

[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.760]   He's on us.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.960]   He's not alive anymore.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.400]   OK, his hologram's coming in.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.880]   His hologram's not coming in.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.380]   Beat it.

[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.160]   But I do need you to know that I did prepare something
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.480]   special for this night.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.080]   Hit it, guys.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.600]   [CHEERING]
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:34.560]   She was more like a beauty queen from the movie scene.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.040]   Baby, don't mind what you do to me.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.040]   I am the one who will dance on the floor and run.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.440]   She told me, girl, it was Billie Jean.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.920]   And she calls the scene.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.800]   And every head turned with eyes that dream of being the one who
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.280]   will dance on the floor and run.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:04.240]   People always told me, be careful what you do.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.240]   Don't go around bringing young girls home.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.320]   And mother always told me, don't go around bringing
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.800]   young girls home.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.800]   And mother always told me, be careful who you love.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   Be careful what you do.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   Because a lie becomes a truth.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   Hey.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.800]   [CHEERING]
