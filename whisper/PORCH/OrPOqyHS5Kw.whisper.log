[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   [Music]
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Well, hello porch friends. It is awesome to be with you. My name is Todd. I'm on the
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.520]   pastoral staff here at Watermark and I love dropping in with you at the porch
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.240]   and we're coming to you right here from Dallas, Texas. Not balmy Dallas, Texas.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.440]   Frozen ice over Dallas, Texas and that's why we wish we were with our friends out
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.800]   there in Scottsdale and that nice balmy weather you have in Arizona. We got
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.960]   friends up there in Boise who are always cold so they've got no sympathy for us
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.080]   and our friends up in Indianapolis we know are getting hit and certainly all
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.840]   our friends around Texas, Houston and other places we're in the middle of a
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.400]   pretty significant weather event right now and so I'm not in the room with all
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.900]   my usual friends here in Dallas where we're just a local church trying to be
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.680]   and make disciples and loving folks and we know that you're doing that in
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.000]   locations that are out there but everybody's online tonight and so it's
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.440]   awesome to be with you and we are in a series called fortune-telling and
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.680]   fortune-telling what we're doing is basically taking words in the past the
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.120]   only words in the past that are reliable God's Word and seeing what it has to say
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.600]   about our future and I want you to know we're committed to you because we are
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.680]   giving you this message at great peril to ourself because there's been a break
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.400]   in our sprinkler system here the pipes have burst and so they've told us that
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.900]   if there's a fire in this room and there's no sprinkler system there's no
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.520]   alarm it's gonna go off so there's a good chance like a fire is just gonna
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.280]   come in the middle of this thing so you want to hang around and watch and just
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.800]   see what in the world is gonna happen to us but we're committed to you and so
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.960]   we're just we're willing to be here because we've already answered the
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.640]   question from God's Word in our own life that you're gonna want to get answered
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.200]   tonight and so tonight's question is relevant to all of us all the time and
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.800]   certainly to those of us who are teaching you at great peril and the
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.000]   question is this will I go to heaven when I die now I do want to just
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.480]   preface that a little bit before we dive in a little bit and just tell you that
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.840]   we're not really talking when we answer this question about fire insurance only
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.480]   right because that's why some people look at this thing man I gotta get good
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.560]   with God so I can have fire insurance no what we're really talking to you about
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.040]   is if you can answer this question well and by the way we're all gonna die we're
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.520]   either gonna die or we're gonna be here when Christ himself returns and brings
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.960]   judgment to the earth all right and so you want to be a person who knows you're
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.440]   at peace with God and if you're at peace with God and you know where you're going
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.800]   to spend your eternity there's gonna be a resurrection the Bible tells us some
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.760]   to everlasting life and some to everlasting judgment and if you're an
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.240]   individual who affirmatively answers the question I know I'm gonna rise to
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.360]   everlasting life that means you're gonna get to live and enjoy that God now so
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.920]   we're really talking about is not how can I go to heaven when I die but how
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.760]   can I experience God's abundant life now how can my 20s be free not from the fear
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.160]   of sudden death and judgment but free from hopelessness anxiety despair
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.360]   leaning my ladder against the wrong wall and trying to find success in all the
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.320]   wrong places if you'll just track with me and let me answer from old words the
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.160]   ancient words that foretell our future it's going to change your 20s not just
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.080]   your forever but look man the Bible does say that this life is a vapor that if
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.200]   we're given to strength our life will be somewhere just a little bit north of 80
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.000]   and so it's crazy to live with a sense of indifference about eternity because
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.280]   you think you can have more fun today and I'm just gonna tell you you will not
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.200]   have a greater 20s if you rebel against God and put this question off till you
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.320]   need it and by the way none of us knows when we're gonna need it there's all
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.240]   kinds of folks in their 20s they're gonna face the end of their life in a
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.600]   way they never expected but what I'm concerned about tonight is how you can
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.120]   attract to experience life right now in your 20s that will allow you also to
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.960]   have a great sense of peace that when you die you're gonna continue the
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.000]   relationship with God you've already been enjoying so let me just start this
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.800]   by saying this to you you can know the answer to the question you can know the
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.920]   answer the question because God is kindness has has given us in his Word
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.400]   okay this is what his Word says in first John chapter 5 verse 11 and following it
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.960]   says and the testimony is this that God has given us eternal life and the life
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.420]   is in his Son now watch this he who has the Son has the life he does not have
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.200]   the Son does not have the life these things I have written to you who
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.640]   believe in order that you might know that you have eternal life so I just
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.720]   want to make it really clear as we get started that you can know the answer to
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.360]   this question God's Word doesn't want you to have to kind of wander through
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.200]   life hoping you got it right the Bible says you can know but here's the deal so
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:36.880]   many folks get distracted by life and maybe by the promise of all the wonder
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.900]   of youth right the Bible says the glory of a young man is his strength which
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.520]   means hey man I'm good to roll I I'm I'm pretty certain I know where to find life
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.800]   I'm pretty sure I know how to get the most out of this life and so a lot of
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.960]   times we've bought the lie that God's not good and his words not true and the
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.000]   disobeying it was not that big a deal and so a lot of us we got to go down
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.080]   some long and winding and dark roads to find out that maybe this way that seems
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.560]   right to me is gonna end in death and not in life and I know a lot of my
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:15.360]   friends that listen to us at the porch have experienced a living death you have
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.480]   not experienced the life that you thought following your own way and
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.640]   following your flesh would give to you and you're sitting there not just
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.720]   wondering what'll happen when you die but if life is worth living while you're
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.760]   alive well track with me because I think you'll find that it is this last week
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.640]   just a little bit pre Valentine's Day I took my Valentine my wife of 30 years
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:46.080]   away to a place south of the border in sunny Mexico and it was amazing and while
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.920]   we were there we you know were some friends and there were some other folks
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.200]   that around this one little nice resort pool that we were at and there was one
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.480]   gal that wouldn't be at the porch if she was hanging around with us she was
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.440]   probably your grandmother and she was clearly very wealthy because it became
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.920]   obvious to us that she was pretty doggone comfortable at that place and
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.840]   the reason she was comfortable is because she had been at this resort
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:16.640]   since September she had been there since September the gal cruises for a living
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.560]   she basically lives on cruise ships because the cruise ships were shut down
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   she found the nicest resort she could and she just made it home and so she was
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.440]   hanging out by this pool and I hadn't known this about her yet I hadn't talked
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.960]   to her but I'd seen her and you know honestly she was alone and she didn't
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.200]   have the benefit of a spouse like I did and she had benefit of friends like I
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.120]   did and I was I was in engaging with a bunch of folks engaging a lot of folks I
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.720]   saw she was just kind of alone and so I waited till there was a moment that kind
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.020]   of fell into my lap when she was the only person at the pool what had happened
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.280]   is the Sun has started to set my wife and I ran up we grabbed a shower and we
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.440]   changed and we're getting ready to walk to dinner and there she was my friend
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.080]   Robin sitting by a pool all by herself and so as my wife and I walked by I
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.720]   turned to her not knowing her name yet or anything I just turned around I said
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:07.040]   hey you win you got the whole thing to yourself right you win this this place
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.520]   is yours you were the longest out here today and she turned and she started
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.840]   talking to me and she didn't stop I mean she talked for about 12 to 15 minutes
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:20.280]   before I could say another thing because she was obviously so alone and hadn't
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.520]   talked to anybody she lamented a little bit about and told us a little bit of
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.160]   her story and lamented a little bit about how you know normally it's more
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.840]   social on a cruise but a lot of people come here just for a little bit of time
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.280]   and they want to be alone and they're relaxing like we had been for the last
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.680]   two days before I'd really engaged her and I just told her I said hey listen
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.600]   I've got a couple waiting for me at dinner literally about 12 minutes into
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.760]   her just sharing about her story and I said hey will you be out here tomorrow
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:50.200]   let's catch up tomorrow so I went to dinner with my wife and came home she
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.640]   and I prayed for Robin and the next day as we were by the pool I looked for the
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.980]   right opportunity to just say hey Robin you know let's talk a little bit and we
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:03.600]   just got to talk to her and she shared a lot about her amazing travels and they
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.200]   were amazing she'd been doing it for quite some time and had the means and
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.780]   resources to do that but I turned to her and I just said to her at one point I go
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.800]   Robin one of the things that you do when you're with friends is at some point you
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.100]   tell them the most important thing about you if I was gonna get to really know
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.960]   you and you were gonna tell me this is the most important thing about me what
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.520]   would you tell me about you and she went on to say well you you probably know I
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.320]   like gardening when I'm home and I love to travel which I had figured out by
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.800]   that point I might throw in she also loved to talk but who doesn't when
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.200]   you're alone a lot but but anyway she told me that and so she never asked me
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.960]   though what was the most important thing to me but what happened in her continuing
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.880]   to talk is she shared with me a little bit about a trip that she had taken at
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.660]   one point to Cuba and in the midst of this she mentioned the fact that she
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.720]   went by Fidel Castro's very expensive grave and that's where I jumped in said
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.300]   let me stop you for a second and let me ask you this do you think when Fidel
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:10.560]   Castro was living he ever thought about that grave and do you think that he was
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.160]   living in such a way all his years that he was experiencing everything that a
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.560]   guy wants to experience and she thought well I don't know he certainly was
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.680]   powerful he was powerful at the expense to a lot of other people and by the way
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:27.760]   so many times when men apart from God trying to find life they exert their own
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.440]   will and way and and live according to their own power in a way that they don't
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.160]   really care what happens to women that are in their path or other emotions at
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.720]   hearts that are in their path and a lot of times they do it in a way that's even
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:46.200]   reckless to their own soul not so with living according to God's power it leads
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.040]   to blessing for so many people but what I said to my friend was this I'm gonna
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.040]   share with you I I said let me just let me just tell you a story all right
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:00.400]   because you know I hear Rob you've you thought much about your own grave and
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.840]   she goes well I just you know I don't like to talk about those kind of things
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.120]   and I said well let me tell you a story and this was a story I told her I said
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.880]   this is a story about a guy who was himself very wealthy and very learned
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:18.840]   and and he ruled over a lot of people but he had this one specific servant
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:23.680]   that wasn't very sharp in fact he was the dumbest guy he had ever met in fact
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.760]   he was so annoyed him that eventually one day he came up upon the servant when
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.080]   he had asked him to do something the servant forgot what he was supposed to
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.320]   do and got to it even late when he did finally get pushed to do it again and he
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.840]   did it wrong she didn't remember how he was supposed to do it and he called his
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.440]   servant over there and he was a likable servant but he was just stupid and he
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.120]   just said to him hey come here I want to tell you something I love you all right
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.400]   I mean you're my servant and I think you're doing the best you can but you
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.560]   are the dumbest person I've ever met you're the greatest fool I've ever known
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.200]   and I'll tell you what I'm gonna give you a stick all right and I want you to
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.880]   carry this stick and hold on to it the rest of your life until you see somebody
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.320]   more stupid and foolish than you now I told this story my friend Robin she was
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.560]   that's awful just hang in there it's just a story Robin all right and so
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.240]   anyway so this this fool's got this stick and he's walking around with it
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:16.040]   for a couple of decades now as it happens with all of us this master of
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.720]   his was getting to a place where he himself was no longer going to be a
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.840]   master over anybody he was going to die and so he was calling people into his
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.600]   presence that had lived with him for a while he said go get that that dumb
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.240]   servant of mine because I just want to tell him you know I want to make sure he
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.760]   hears me say something nice to him because the last thing he maybe heard
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.000]   from you say was here's your stick don't give it to anybody till you die and he
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.360]   goes well he's still got the stick so anyway he calls for that servant that
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.680]   servant comes in carrying his stick and his master says hey I just wanted to say
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.960]   goodbye to you because he was just dumb he tried to dumb down the fact that he
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.160]   had an impending death and he said I'm not gonna see you anymore in a very
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.960]   short period of time and the servants of well why is that master he said well
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.400]   cuz I'm going on a trip he goes oh you're going a trip where's your trip
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.880]   and I said well I'm not really sure where my trip is you're not sure where
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.000]   your trip is well how long have you known that you were gonna go on this
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.400]   trip and the master looked at the dumb servant said well I've known my entire
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.360]   life I was gonna take this trip well master what will you need on this trip
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.640]   that you don't know where you're going that you've known your whole life that
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.480]   you're gonna get there what will you need to have it be a successful trip
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.200]   what provisions will will make your journey one of peace and the master said
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.840]   you know I don't really know and so the dumb servant looked at him and said let
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.840]   me ask you a question master you've known you were gonna go on this trip
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.160]   your whole life he said yes and you've you don't know where exactly it is or
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.160]   how to get there and and you don't know what you need to take that's gonna make
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.880]   your trip prosperous and successful and the master goes yeah and the servant
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:58.760]   looked at him said master here's your stick see if you know that you're going
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.600]   to die and all of us know that we're going to die the statistics for death if
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.720]   you haven't noticed are pretty impressive all right for every one person
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:11.360]   that's born there is a corresponding death to that person death is I don't
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.360]   know how many folks have been on earth since the beginning but it's in the
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:22.720]   teens of the billions but there have been 17 ish billion people born and that
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:29.560]   many people die there is one outstanding example one outstanding exception to
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:36.240]   that rule and he is the answer to how to live your 20s the way you want to and
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.080]   how to have peace with God his name obviously is Jesus there are few others
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:46.680]   if you know your Bible that were removed in a rather spectacular way and stood
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.080]   before God and still face judgment and they had to be ready to answer this
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:57.920]   exact same question which is how can I a piece with God so let me remind you that
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:04.080]   you're gonna benefit from this answer not just on your judgment day but you're
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.680]   gonna benefit from the answer to this question right now because you're gonna
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.120]   learn about the character and the nature and the goodness of God so you can begin
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.040]   to walk with him today and Jesus didn't come so you'd have fire insurance Jesus
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:23.480]   came but you might have life and have it abundantly so I'm gonna read you a
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.680]   little story just to kind of set this up because I'm gonna make a bit of a
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:33.480]   disclaimer and that is this you can know as to whether or not you're going to
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.480]   have it I already read to you first John chapter 5 verses 11 through 13 you can
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.640]   know but only the Father knows for sure about you now why do I say that because
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.320]   sometimes people come to me and say hey man Todd will you give me assurance that
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:52.560]   I'm saved okay and and I think I would say to you what other prophets of God
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.880]   you know men who bring forth the truth of God have said to people in the past
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.480]   and I would say hey well why don't you bear fruit in keeping with whatever
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:04.740]   repentance you have professed in your relationship and knowledge about the
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.000]   goodness and the holiness of God that's what John the Baptist said to the
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.080]   Pharisees actually but the Bible says that God has given you his word so that
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:19.600]   you can know that you have eternal life but only God knows for sure who those
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.680]   people are God's not gonna call me and say hey Todd those folks that are
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.200]   members of watermark should I let them into heaven he doesn't need my opinion
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.720]   my job is not to see through people to find out if you're really saved my job
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:38.760]   is to see you through to greater faithfulness and my job tonight is to
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:44.960]   help you see what God's Word says these ancient words that will lead you on a
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.720]   path of not just security at the grave but what the Bible describes as
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:56.160]   prosperity not fleeting prosperity like fame and materialism but a life that
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:02.800]   prospers a soul that is at peace and filled with life and joy here's the
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.840]   parable that Jesus told it comes in Matthew chapter 13 where Jesus is
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:13.680]   telling a lot of stories just to teach us about the kingdom of God and this is
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:19.080]   what he's saying about how we'll know at the end who is and who isn't his okay so
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.320]   I'm reading this parable because I'm answering the question is why do I say
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:28.920]   you can know first John 5 11 through 13 but only the Father knows for sure about
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.200]   you here's why Jesus presented another parable to them saying the kingdom of
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:38.680]   heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field Matthew 13
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:44.240]   now I'm in verse 25 but while this his men were sleeping his enemy came and
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:51.200]   sowed tares among the wheat tares are a form of plant that look like wheat but
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.880]   they're not fruit bearing okay that's what a tare is it says these guys these
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:00.600]   enemies came in and they sowed the seed if you will that leads to tares amongst
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.600]   the wheat and when the wheat sprouted and bore grain then the tares became
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:10.060]   evident also the slaves of the landowner came and said hey sir did you not sow
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:15.000]   good seed in your field how then does it have tares how is there some fake wheat
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.900]   kind of tares are to wheat what pyrite is to gold it's fool's gold all right it
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:25.760]   looks like gold but it's not really gold all right so he says an enemy has done
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.720]   this and the slave said him do you want us then to go and gather up the tares
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:35.560]   but he said no for while you're gathering up the tares you may uproot
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.640]   the wheat with them allow both to grow together this is so important allow both
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.800]   the grow together until the harvest and at the time of harvest I will say to the
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.960]   Reapers first gather the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up but
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.520]   gather wheat into my barn and then Jesus goes on to close up the story by saying
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:59.040]   hey so will the end of time be when the Son of Man sends his angels out and
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:06.160]   he'll gather his true children to him in other words we are not to walk around
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:12.520]   going save not save save not saved but we are to be individuals that spur each
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.400]   other on the love and good deeds we are to be people that admonish the unruly
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.720]   encourage the faint-hearted help the weak we are to be friends that remind
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:28.400]   each other of what God says is true and that is just like wheat bears fruit that
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.520]   leads to life people that have a relationship with God and that are rooted
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:37.480]   and grounded in their relationship with him the expectation is that they will
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:44.680]   too bear fruit in keeping with their repentance in other words it's not just
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:51.160]   going to be that they say something it's going to be true of them that they do
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:57.600]   something that there is a life change a transformation that God produces let me
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:06.240]   just give you an example of what should not give you any assurance and I do want
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:11.160]   to make a little distinction right here is when I talk to you about assurance of
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:18.160]   salvation I want to separate that from what the Bible teaches is true about
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:23.000]   those who do have a relationship with God which is eternal security so we are
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.760]   secure because of what Christ has done and because of Christ calling and
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:34.440]   choosing us and Christ providing for us and working in us a repentance that
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:40.280]   causes us to see our need and trust in him and we become secure in our
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:46.280]   relationship with him this is what the Bible says in in John chapter 10 verse
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.120]   14 right after he says I've come that they might have life and have it
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:54.440]   abundantly he also says I'm the Good Shepherd and I know my own he says a
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.840]   little later he says and none that the Father have given to me will I lose when
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:05.040]   people say you can lose your salvation if you have it that's not a comment
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:10.160]   about your inability to maintain your salvation the reason I am so offended by
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.960]   that idea it's because it really is an assault not on you the sheep who might
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:21.680]   wonder but on the shepherd who says that he won't lose even one now here's what
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:27.440]   is true is there gonna be some people that say Jesus is my shepherd Jesus is
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:36.440]   my shepherd that we're gonna find out Jesus was not their shepherd I
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:42.000]   introduced this right here because I want you to listen closely to how you
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.640]   can have assurance because you truly should know that you are secure in your
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:57.680]   relationship with God and not be filled with delusion that is going to cost you
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.040]   your very soul it's also by the way an answer to a question that so many of you
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.080]   have which is hey I said I believe that Jesus is Lord I I said I was a sinner
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.200]   but where's this abundant life where's where's the goodness and the richness of
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.040]   life my life has only gotten worse since I've trusted in Jesus I don't sense it's
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.880]   abundant life I have people ask me this all the time it's probably a question
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:22.200]   that you've got like how do I experience the abundant life the answer is you know
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:28.040]   the Son and you walk with the Son the Son is the visible image of the
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:32.760]   invisible God and God is filled with loving kindness and truth no good thing
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:38.680]   does he withhold from those who love him if you knew that Jesus is the source of
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:45.920]   peace and life and goodness why would you ever do anything except keep your
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:50.400]   eyes fixed on him the the author and the perfecter of your fate if you knew that
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.200]   walking with him and letting him inform your heart and your soul about where to
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.120]   live was gonna lead to the good and acceptable and perfect life why would
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:04.880]   you ever leave his ways and so there are some people they're gonna say that they
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:10.720]   know Jesus but then they don't walk and abide with Jesus and that should make
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:16.280]   you question your certainty or your assurance that you really know the
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:26.120]   goodness of God let me just start by introducing you a guy that that we bring
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.400]   up a lot frankly around the porch and he's known in scripture as the rich
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.480]   young ruler all right I'm not gonna read you the whole story about the rich young
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.160]   ruler you can do that in Mark chapter 10 and he shows up in Matthew 19 other
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.320]   places in your New Testament but in Mark chapter 10 verse 17 I'm just gonna take
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:46.440]   you to the very first verse and I want us to make some observations about what
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:53.240]   happens with this guy okay because this this Jesus this one who is the source of
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:58.480]   life was setting out on a journey and a man ran up to him this is not a story
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.920]   this is an actual interaction that Jesus had and a man ran up to maybe you ran up
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:07.000]   to the porch tonight and you you have got some of the exact same questions
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:15.560]   that this guy did the guy walks up to Jesus and he knelt before him and he
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:22.360]   asked him after addressing him with nobility and truth he called him good
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.600]   teacher that word good isn't just mean better than others the word he used for
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:31.360]   good right there is a very specific word that says without air perfect teacher
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.720]   which is why Jesus says to this guy why do you call me perfect no one's perfect
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:42.520]   except God alone but he says he on his knees he calls Jesus perfect and then he
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:47.400]   says the porch isn't around yet they're not doing a fortune-telling series yet
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.880]   they're not answering the question how I know if I go to heaven when I die so I
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:57.040]   got to come to you and I want to know what do I do to inherit eternal life
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.480]   now let me just make three quick observations just from this one verse
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:09.320]   because I think this will help you number one outward signs of pure of
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:15.240]   piety outward signs of piety remember this brother got on his knees are no
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:22.640]   assurance of inward surrender we're gonna find out that this guy was doing
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.160]   something very religious right when someone takes a knee before somebody it
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:32.160]   looks like I'm showing you honor and I'm I'm even doing what you see a lot of
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:37.400]   people who do stuff like this and take a knee before an altar but that outward
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.920]   sign does not necessarily always equate itself to inward surrender we're gonna
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:51.160]   find that this rich young ruler thought he was as good as Jesus secondly correct
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.960]   professions of faith now this one you got to really listen closely to correct
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:01.280]   professions of faith are not to be confused with somebody who because they
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.920]   say something that it's a correct profession necessarily has a correct
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:13.040]   position in terms of their reconciliation with God before the Father you can say
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:20.880]   things about God that are right and true and still not be reconciled to God when
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.920]   this man called Jesus a good teacher just like some of you might say yeah I
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.480]   think Jesus is Lord I'm not I'm not a Muslim I don't say he's just a man I'm
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.760]   not a Hindu I don't say he's just one of many men that have actualized into gods
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.680]   I'm not a Mormon I don't believe that Jesus was you know the brother of
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:42.880]   Lucifer and and any other of the different ideas that have been falsely
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:48.060]   attributed to who Jesus is you might reject all of those you might go no
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:53.160]   Jesus the Son of God he is he was with the Father in the beginning in the
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.720]   beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God you might
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.560]   say all the fullness of deity dwells in him you might say he is the intrinsically
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.880]   good one and the exact representative nature of God and all that would be true
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:11.800]   but just because you say those things it doesn't mean that you are reconciled to
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:17.400]   the Father in a correct position of being restored because of your
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:23.120]   sinfulness which separates you from God saying what's true of God and even true
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.320]   of yourself doesn't give you salvation I'm going to give you the best example I
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:34.280]   can of this before I come back to the third thing and and that is demons if
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:42.320]   you ever really want to know and study about who exactly Jesus is a good thing
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.680]   to do is to go look at eternal well not eternal because they were created but go
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.240]   and created spirit beings that were already in the presence of God the
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.760]   Father God the Son and God the Spirit in all eternity they're called demons in
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.600]   the scripture all right and what I want to just make really clear right here is
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:05.320]   that you want to be an individual that's got a dynamic faith the rich young
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:11.160]   ruler did not have a dynamic faith he had what the demons had and there's a
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:16.440]   difference between a dynamic faith which brings the power of transformation and
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:21.160]   healing and reconciliation to God and a demonic faith which has a correct
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:26.120]   profession associated with it and words that say something but do not have a
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:30.800]   life that actually responds to it so just let me give you a few verses here
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:36.880]   in James chapter 2 verse 19 it says this you believe that God is one in other
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.880]   words I do you hold to the Trinitarian view of scripture that says that there
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:47.880]   is one God who is eternally existed in the form of three persons who relate to
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:52.480]   each other in mutual subjection love and honor that there's distinction within
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:58.200]   the Godhead but there is also unity and subordination they're all co-eternal
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.480]   they're all all omniscient all-powerful you can have a right understanding of
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:10.240]   the Godhead a Trinitarian view and still be deluded because the scripture says
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.480]   you believe that God is one that there's only one God and he is who he's revealed
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:19.640]   himself to be well that's good you do well but I want to remind you James says
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:26.920]   even the demons believe that in fact they're so convinced it's true that they
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.280]   shudder when they think about the nature and the holiness and the reality of God
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.680]   because they've rebelled against the nature and the holiness and the reality
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.960]   of God and they know that judgment awaits them so they say the correct
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.440]   profession but they're not in a correct position before the Father let me just
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:47.560]   show you a couple of other verses in Matthew chapter 8 verse 29 this is
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:54.560]   demon interacting with a spirit being that's part of the demonic angelic realm
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:01.000]   and this is what they cry out to him they say what business do we have with
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.280]   each other meaning holy Son of God what business do we have with you have you
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:13.760]   come to torment us before our time this the same group of demons was interacting
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.160]   with Jesus in in the gospel of Mark in chapter 1 in verse 24 this is what it
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.480]   says it says again what business do we have with you Jesus of Nazareth God made
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:30.120]   man have you come to destroy us we know who you are you're the Holy One of God
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:36.440]   now what I read to you those two verses because if you want a really good sense
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:42.080]   of who God is listen to spiritual beings who have seen God enthroned in the
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:47.920]   heavens demons biblically have the most accurate theology in almost all the
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.840]   Bible from an information perspective their theology is right which is the
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.680]   study of the Godhead their Christology is right like who is Jesus he's the Holy
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:01.200]   One of God their angiology is correct they know that that they are not God and
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.720]   they know that certain angels are going to be judged because they rebelled
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:12.400]   against God their hermitology is correct which is that but there is salvation
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.480]   only in Christ alone that they are separate from which gets to the theodicy
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.800]   which is the study of the justice of God their eschatology is right which is the
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.800]   study of last things and ultimate days demons nail it in every one of those
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.160]   categories and they are not in a correct position before the Father why am I
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:36.160]   telling you this because this is not an informational issue with you your
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.680]   salvation is not determined by a propositional true/false statement in
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:46.520]   other words I can't just say to you are you a sinner is God holy has God made
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:51.480]   provision for your sin is the way that men can be reconciled to God only
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:56.200]   through Jesus Christ and you go yes I'm a sinner yes God is holy yes my sin
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.280]   separates myself from him yes Jesus died on the cross in order that I might be
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:06.880]   saved yes there is no other way to the Father except through Jesus there is no
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.280]   other name you would repeat what Peter said not long after the resurrection
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:17.040]   under heaven by which men must be saved except for Jesus Christ if all you do is
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:26.880]   say those things but it's not accompanied by an abiding belief then
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:33.840]   you're gonna miss heaven by 18 inches you got the right information but it's
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.400]   not seated if you will and I point to my heart because the Bible speaks about the
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:45.560]   heart as the seat of human emotion the seat of human understanding not the
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.640]   organ the heart but what makes up in effect the true belief of the soul of
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:59.520]   man it is possible to have a good theology solid doctrine and be a demon
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:06.040]   now listen I like to tell people that there's nothing more important than
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:10.760]   solid doctrine except solid doctrine isn't the most important thing do you
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.200]   hear that paradox in other words you've got to know truth because truth is what
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.040]   sets you free but knowing truth is only the first part that's why the Bible says
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:22.160]   acquire wisdom and all your acquisition acquire understanding because
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:26.040]   understanding is wisdom applied this is the problem with so many porchies this
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.400]   is the problem with so many churchmen this is why so many of you are now just
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.080]   returning to church through this ministry called the porch and you're
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.560]   like you know what my mom and dad said they love God but man my mom and dad are
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.920]   divorced my mom and dad was let our home in a way that did not make our home
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:45.560]   filled with peace because so many of you maybe grew up in homes of people who
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:50.840]   were churchmen who knew truth and had solid doctrine and dogma that they would
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.560]   attest to but they did not abide with walk with remain with Jesus in their
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:02.680]   walking they didn't bear fruit in keeping with their professed confession
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:09.040]   how can you know you're going to heaven well as I already told you it's not
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:14.320]   because you're gonna be somebody who just walks up to Jesus and takes a knee
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.960]   it's not gonna because when you walk up to Jesus and take a knee you say the
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.720]   right things and I'm just gonna tell you you're even being interested in how I'm
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.720]   gonna answer this question is not a guarantee here's the third thing I would
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.760]   show you is this guy said how do I know I can inherit eternal life and so I
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.640]   would tell you a concern for spiritual things does not ensure that there is a
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:36.400]   condition of spiritual trust I'm glad you want to know in this fortune-telling
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.200]   series the answer to the question how can I know I have eternal life or I'm
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:44.880]   gonna go to heaven when I die I'm glad you're not a fool who just doesn't
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.560]   really care about this journey all of us think about it I guarantee you Fidel
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.640]   Castro did I know my friend Robin did when we finally got into it and we
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:57.560]   talked about it she had thought about it she knows that this cruise through life
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.120]   is gonna come to an end as some of you guys know that you're not cruising
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.880]   through life the way that you want to right now in your 20s and you're
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:07.000]   wondering how to get off the ship of despair that you're on and the answer is
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.400]   Jesus but it's not just doing spiritual things religious activity locking in on
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:22.360]   the porch on Tuesday nights it's not just saying Jesus is Lord it's knowing
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:31.840]   Jesus is Lord there is a world of difference between believing about and
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:38.720]   believing in there's a difference between a said faith and a saving faith
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:43.840]   there's a difference between professing Christ and possessing a relationship
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:50.480]   with his spirit now I'm going to tell you one of the greatest assurances that
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:59.040]   I've got that I'm saved is because of what happened in my life when I came to
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:04.280]   understand who I was and who God was in fact one of the things we love to do and
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:08.520]   I had this conversation with somebody just this week is is that when we are
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.320]   engaging them sometimes we'll just go okay let's just say that you're at the
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:18.280]   end of your life okay and and and you stand before the Lord how confident are
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:21.520]   you that you would go to heaven right are you at a point in your spiritual
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:26.040]   life where if you die today you know you'd go to heaven and most people when
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:32.040]   you ask him that will kind of go well yeah yeah don't say with a lot of
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.400]   confidence but they kind of say it that way in which you want to follow up with
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.520]   them and just say okay well how about this on a scale of 1 to 10 how sure are
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:42.000]   you that if you die you'd go to heaven a lot of times people are just trying to
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   be humble and they'll they'll go I don't know I mean you know I'm not gonna say
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.040]   I'm perfect you know but I'm not Fidel Castro you know I haven't brought people
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.320]   into atheistic communistic oppression and sold him a bill of goods under the
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.680]   idea of socialism what really became just self elevation and oppression of
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:06.440]   the masses no I'm not Fidel Castro I'm not Hitler but I'm I'm not sure I'm
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:13.000]   mother Teresa either so I don't know seven maybe an eight and I want to tell
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.120]   you that if your answer is anything other than a zero or a ten you're a very
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.600]   arrogant person in fact I can remember the last time I had this conversation
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.680]   with somebody I just go man that's interesting can you tell me why you were
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.720]   a seven and they basically went through something like I just shared with you
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.480]   they they they gave some explanation of their own life they started to build
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:37.020]   their own resume I'm not Castro I'm not Hitler right and I'm not gonna say that
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:40.500]   I'm you know perfect I'm not Billy Graham you know I'm not mother Teresa so
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:44.460]   I'm not a ten so I want to get over here to be like you know a seven and they
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:47.120]   think they're being humble what they're really doing is being arrogant when I
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:53.040]   look at them and I tell them well I'm a ten they often say to me that's arrogant
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:38:00.560]   and I go but let me just explain to you why I'm a ten I'm not a ten for the same
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:04.680]   reason you think you're a seven because if I was putting together my resume I'm
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.480]   not gonna tell you I'm pastor of a church in Dallas Texas I'm not gonna
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.280]   tell you I've memorized a ton of scripture I'm not gonna tell you that I
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:13.760]   say correct things about God I'm gonna tell you that left to myself all I
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:23.000]   deserve is judgment I'm a ten because my future fortune is told by some ancient
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:30.880]   words which tells me that the wages of sin is death but the free gift of God is
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:36.400]   eternal life through Christ Jesus it's a gift I'm gonna tell you I'm a ten
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:43.740]   because I know that I've been saved not as a result of my own works but by the
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:49.620]   gracious gift of God for by grace we have been saved through faith and even
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:54.240]   our own faith is not of ourself it's a gift from God nothing we do is a result
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:39:00.680]   of works so that no man should boast my ten is not my boasting in my resume my
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:06.680]   ten is boasting in the righteousness of God and what he has done for me this is
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:11.480]   the difference gang between religion and having a right relationship with God
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:20.520]   religion is what man does Christianity is a declaration of what Christ has done
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:27.440]   now what you have to ask yourself is do I just know the facts some of us haven't
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.840]   even dealt with the fact that when I lean in my own understanding and go my
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.360]   own way it's that bad yet and I would just tell you if you like what you got
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.520]   keep doing what you're doing but if you keep doing what you're doing you're not
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.920]   gonna like what you got and I'm gonna guess you're gonna not like what you got
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.760]   even a long time before you meet ultimate judgment you're gonna live
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:48.760]   under the judgment of your own rebellion against God the Bible says the way of
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:54.440]   the treacherous is hard but I got great news for some of you guys that are
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:59.680]   already scarred that have already lived hard lives because you didn't know the
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:07.840]   goodness of God he is gentle and kind and he's made provision for your sin
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:16.160]   and he wants to heal you and make you whole good works is not good enough the
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:21.040]   Bible makes that clear in Matthew chapter 5 verse 20 Jesus says I say to
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.200]   you unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.600]   who had all kinds of correct God language and did all kind of correct God
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.560]   things and said they were really concerned about spiritual things it
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:37.040]   wasn't good enough that was like saying Billy Graham and mother Teresa
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:43.640]   exponentially combined aren't good enough a man who is filled with the
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:49.120]   preaching of truth and a woman who is filled with good works combined together
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:56.760]   don't make you save what makes you saved right with God is faith in the work of
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:03.240]   God alone Matthew chapter 5 verse 48 says here's the standard you got to be
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.560]   perfect like your Heavenly Father is perfect that's why Billy grandmother
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:09.600]   Teresa and the Pharisees don't make it that's why no resume building could ever
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:15.800]   get the job done and it's why if you understand the kindness and the goodness
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:23.560]   of God that all of us as humans have left and rejected and saying in our own
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:26.560]   ways you know I don't need you I'll manage my relationship with you I want I
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.960]   don't really want to tick you off but I'm certainly not gonna order my life
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.840]   the way that you want people that say that are people that don't know the
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:39.200]   kindness of God if you know that God left the comfort of heaven and took on
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.400]   the form of humankind and being found the flesh being made in the appearance
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.280]   of man he humbled himself became obedient to the point of death even
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:51.840]   death on the cross to redeem you and me what else do you need to know about the
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:56.120]   nature of God to turn from your own sin and to run to him and then say I want to
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:01.240]   know more of you and follow more in your ways I want to live my 20s for you not
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.760]   just have an answer to a test
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:17.480]   the thing that I want you to walk away with tonight is not that you need fire
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:23.800]   insurance now that you need to know information right I mean all of us you
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.760]   know I don't have a hard time convincing anybody the fact that left to ourself
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:33.840]   life isn't all that we want our life to be but here's the question what are you
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.480]   gonna do about the fact that this way that you thought would lead to life is
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.600]   not leading to the life that you wanted if you're missing out on the abundant
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:50.040]   life it's because you're not abiding with God see people on earth sometimes
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:53.880]   their pipes freeze and break I don't care if you're a church I don't care if
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:57.520]   you have a building that's used to broadcast the gospel message out there
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:05.840]   sometimes your pipes freeze but there is peace and a prosperous hope even in
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:09.880]   the midst of despair when you know the kindness and goodness of God because
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:12.800]   he's told you why pipes freeze on earth because this is not the world that he
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.600]   created it's a world that's been marred and affected by sin just like yours and
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.240]   just like mine do you know what the greatest assurance is that I know that
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:25.920]   I've been saved is now when I sin I hate it I'm just gonna close with this if
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:30.800]   there has not been a transformation in your nature
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:36.080]   Proverbs 26 says just like a dog returns to its vomit so does a fool to his
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:43.760]   folly I think that's Proverbs 26 11 Proverbs 26 I think 16 says this a
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:53.240]   righteous man falls seven times and yet rises again when I first came to
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:58.400]   understand who Jesus was and what he had done for me I can remember saying God I
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.240]   know I'm a sinner that's the easiest thing in the world for me to say I just
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.600]   can't believe you're that good that you love me and pursue me anyway but I've
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:10.680]   got no other option first of all I did my work I looked at this idea of a
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:16.240]   resurrection I looked at why the Bible can be trusted I looked at why the the
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:20.760]   fact that Jesus is the only way to God made sense it was a source of grace and
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.880]   not even mean spirited by God and I I did some study and I worked through
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.560]   these questions and I came to a place where I was certain that Christianity
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:33.440]   was true and made sense I didn't commit intellectual suicide and I trusted in
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:41.800]   him and I remember waking up the next day and still being a man that struggled
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:46.000]   with lust and anger and still being a man that struggled with control and
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.920]   still being a man that struggled with how people perceived him and I go oh I
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:53.600]   must not have really prayed to receive Christ because the Bible says therefore
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.800]   if any man is in Christ he's a new creature the old things have passed away
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:00.720]   and new things have come and and I I didn't feel like anything was new my
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:07.200]   flesh still desired things that I know that weren't gonna lead to life but
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:13.400]   here's what changed prior to my coming to know Christ I didn't really hate sin
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:17.440]   I hate when sin cost me something I hate when I was caught I hate when it caused
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:22.240]   shame but I kind of liked it and I thought that if I just had the
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:25.120]   opportunity to sin the way I wanted to when I wanted to without consequence
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:35.360]   life would be great that's a foolish way to live deserves a stick and you get one
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:40.320]   that you beat yourself with right a fool's folly brings his own pain to him
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:46.120]   it's why it says a fool will fall you know a hundred times whereas a wise man
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:49.560]   or get beaten a hundred times and not come to his senses whereas a righteous
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:56.800]   man one rebuke will turn him around what it changed in me was not that my flesh
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:01.560]   still was foolish but what changed me is that in my flesh now was a right
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:06.080]   understanding of God the old thing that was gone was that I wasn't just a slave
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:10.040]   to my flesh the enemy who lies about God in my world which lives in rebellion
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:14.040]   against him now what dwelled inside of me was the Holy Spirit a spirit of truth
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:19.040]   that knew God was good that God was loving that God was kind and I felt
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:26.040]   conviction for my sin if you are an individual that when you see vomit sin
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:31.680]   and you don't just want to eat it but that you eat it and only concern is that
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:41.400]   you'll get caught that should trouble you that means your nature hasn't changed
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:48.280]   that means you're still dog and not a sheep who knows the Good Shepherd who
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:54.240]   sometimes sheep do stupid stuff but you know the whole time like what am I doing
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:57.680]   my master leaves me beside green pastures why do I keep returning to this
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:02.400]   vomit of sin I no longer have to because I now know the goodness of God if that
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:07.120]   conviction is not happening in you if you continue to move towards immorality
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:13.600]   and don't flee it it should bother you now I want to remind you righteous men
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:21.400]   fall but they rise they rise in repentance and they flee in morality and
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:26.240]   they pursue righteousness faith love and peace with those who call on God with a
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.880]   pure heart this is the last verse I want to give you I'm gonna read to you first
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:35.760]   Corinthians first Timothy 6 11 and 12 first Timothy 6 11 and 12 and then we're
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:47.000]   done it's really basically what I'm saying how can you know well I'm gonna
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.840]   keep these verses ready for you but you can know because you say the right thing
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:56.760]   and you believe the right thing the Bible uses the word confess the exact
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:01.160]   same way and what's actually the exact same word in the Greek as profess it's
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:08.200]   homo legio which basically means the same well-spoken word in other words
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:14.800]   what you say is the same as what you really believe that's called a
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:19.720]   confession it's called a profession when the Bible says if you confess with your
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:23.200]   mouth that Jesus is Lord what it's saying it's not just a one-time statement
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:28.680]   like the rich young ruler it means that your life is continually professing I
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:32.720]   know who God is that's why I live the way that I live I'm not saved because of
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:38.880]   how I live but I live this way because I'm saved we are saved by grace through
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:46.120]   faith alone but the faith which saves is never alone it's always accompanied by a
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:52.920]   longing for and an increasing righteousness first Timothy 6 11 and 12
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:58.600]   says this flee from these things but these things if you just go back up and
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:03.760]   read is just covetousness and foolishness and harmful desires you no
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:07.360]   longer want to do what seemed right to you before you're out of the porchy way
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:15.200]   and you're into the way of the Prince of Peace so flee from these things you man
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:20.340]   or woman of God and pursue this is how you know you're saved you pursue the
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:23.600]   Savior that you say is good and that you love you don't just call him a good
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:28.160]   teacher and then go your own way and say my way is good enough you follow your
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:35.320]   good teacher your flesh is not changed your flesh is still fallen that's why
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:39.880]   God's gonna replace it that's why Jesus says deny your flesh take up your cross
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:45.460]   and follow me so you flee from immorality you men of God and pursue
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:49.680]   righteousness godliness faith love perseverance and gentleness now watch
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:53.920]   this verse 12 fight the good fight I tell you know you're saved you make war
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:50:01.680]   against sin and immoralities which wage war against your soul you take hold of
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:06.840]   and you grasp you don't just make a profession one night after a message but
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:11.120]   you take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and you made watch
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:20.720]   this the good confession that word good means it's different than the word good
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:28.960]   teacher but it means sound excellent powerful a life-changing statement about
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:38.280]   who Jesus is not demons who say truth but humble men and women that speak a
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:43.640]   profession or confession that is powerful in their life to affect change
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:49.680]   and you don't do it in isolation you do in the presence of many witnesses so
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.760]   that they can continue to spur you on in loving good deeds and help you follow
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:57.960]   your Good Shepherd that's why Christianity is not an individual sport
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.920]   all of us are gonna stand and sing solo before the Father but he calls you to be
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:04.480]   a part of a body at watermark we call him to be members of this community in
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:08.800]   church be in community and pursue righteousness faith love and peace with
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.960]   us and wherever you are whether it's Indianapolis or Boise or Joplin or
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:19.080]   Houston or Scottsdale or wherever you're at you find God's people who have found
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:24.440]   the goodness of God who are sick of the vomit of what seems right to 20 and 30
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:30.840]   year olds and lives by the ancient words which lead to life when you do that
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:36.320]   you're justified by faith and you have peace with God through Jesus Christ our
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:45.600]   Lord he who has the Son has the life not just them but right now father I pray
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:49.920]   tonight there might be somebody that is sick and tired of being sick and tired
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:56.040]   and they decide to give you their life and they do it not just by saying these
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:00.600]   words but by having a constant confession profession a good confession
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:07.160]   that they agreeably live by running towards that which you call them to
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:11.480]   father will you forgive us that so many times in church pulpits we've just said
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:17.320]   just say these words and you're saved as if some magic abracadabra happens because
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:22.360]   you say some little rhyme we know father that that's not at all what your
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:30.480]   scripture teaches us your scripture teaches us that we should turn and it's
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:35.720]   an about face of living according to our will and way and we don't just say you're
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:40.680]   good we follow you in your goodness and we're not saved because we follow we
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:46.960]   follow because we're saved so Lord if there's somebody out there that just
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:55.200]   says Lord I'm sick and tired I'm weary and heavy laden and I want to come to
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:53:02.600]   you the gentle kindness of God who by no means will let the guilty go unpunished
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:07.400]   that the wages of our sin is still death and we know that we deserve it we come to
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:11.160]   you we say father you forgive us will you give us mercy the mercy that was
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:16.560]   poured out on the cross would you make it mine and now that I see Lord that you
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:21.680]   love me even and demonstrate your love for me even in my sinfulness may I in
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:25.720]   this newness of right understanding this newness of life begin to run with you
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:33.880]   learn your ways walk with your people trust in Jesus fleeing immorality and
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:40.480]   fleshly lusts which wage war against my soul and begin to follow your kindness
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:46.840]   and live in your peace we thank you for all the ancient words that if we just
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:54.200]   live according to them will lead to good fortune will lead to as you've said a
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:59.600]   life that is agreeable to our soul that is good and acceptable and perfect the
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:04.360]   human condition we thank you father though we could never be perfect and no
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:09.000]   we could never be good in your sight you make us good through him who knew no sin
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:15.400]   but became sinner in our behalf help us now to walk with him in righteousness
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:21.120]   and peace in Jesus name amen
