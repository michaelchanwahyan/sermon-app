00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:19,040
 All right.

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,520
 [APPLAUSE]

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,920
 Howdy.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,080
 Hey, it is great to see all of you.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,680
 Man, it is just fun to be back in Texas.

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,960
 For me, always a pleasure to be back.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,080
 My wife and I and our kids, we live in Washington, DC.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,000
 We love it.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,360
 But it's always good to come back

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,240
 to the great state of Texas.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,440
 I sat by a big cowboy on the flight just on the way here

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,520
 with his big hat on.

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,080
 And we just talked about cattle.

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,640
 And I was like, I'm on my way to Texas.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,240
 And it was pretty awesome.

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,160
 And I was on that plane maybe 30 minutes ago.

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,680
 So we just got here.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,360
 And yeah, it's been a crazy day.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,880
 But I am so happy to be in your presence

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,720
 because I love Timothy Atik.

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,600
 TA is one of my favorite people on the planet.

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,480
 And it's been fun to--

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,980
 I tell guys in ministry all the time,

25
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,960
 the longer you're in it, the better it gets.

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,680
 You're going to see heartbreaking things.

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,400
 People fall out.

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,440
 People not make it.

29
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,780
 But you're going to watch some people grow and develop.

30
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,080
 And you're going to watch the best things about them

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,120
 get better.

32
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,720
 And I love watching my friends have a wake of blessing

33
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,560
 behind them.

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,040
 And TA is one of those people.

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,080
 It's one of the great privileges of my life to be his friend.

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,040
 And I love that man.

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,120
 And I love this church.

38
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,040
 Some people I love more than anybody else in the world

39
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,460
 have become substantially better human beings

40
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,920
 as a result of getting involved in this community here.

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,880
 So I love Watermark.

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,960
 And I love being here.

43
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,020
 And yeah, so it's a wonderful place.

44
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,640
 And I got engaged, married in this town.

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,480
 So a lot of fun memories about that too.

46
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,840
 So what a place to be.

47
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,560
 Yeah.

48
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,720
 Mixed feelings on that one.

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,480
 Some people are like, yeah, good for you.

50
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,280
 All right.

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,120
 When I was 24 years old, I moved to Dallas, Texas.

52
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,880
 And when I moved here, a buddy of mine, Matt Chandler,

53
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,320
 was just taken over at a church called The Village.

54
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,240
 And he would ask me to speak there periodically

55
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,640
 when they had like six gatherings.

56
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,960
 And I was like, Matt, you lose your voice.

57
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,400
 It was brutal at the time.

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,960
 But I remember one time he said, I need to take a month off.

59
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,320
 Will you speak for a month?

60
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,280
 And I said, yes.

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,920
 And as a 24-year-old man, I remember closing myself off

62
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,040
 in my little one-bedroom apartment in The Village

63
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,960
 Apartments.

64
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,200
 And I went to write a treatise on the spiritual life,

65
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,240
 on my experience of what it looked like practically

66
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,080
 to walk with God, married with my seminary experience, of what

67
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,280
 I know about the word of God.

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,200
 I wanted to put it all together in a way that

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,880
 was biblically accurate but accessible to humanity.

70
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,920
 And I wrote this series and delivered it there.

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,960
 And we just called it The Fight.

72
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,800
 And years later, it became a book recently.

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,760
 Took 22 years.

74
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,340
 Some of you got a dream in your heart.

75
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,320
 And you may just have to hold onto it for two decades.

76
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,720
 But we put it out as a book called Rest and More.

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,480
 Probably should have called it The Fight.

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,840
 But as TA and I were talking about what to do here,

79
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,320
 we said, man, some of those things

80
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,360
 that I've had a chance to distill and live into

81
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,480
 and see to be really true of what does it really

82
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,680
 mean to walk with God, I want to share some of those with you

83
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,180
 tonight.

84
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,760
 So I've got a copy of your scriptures.

85
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,880
 We're in James chapter 1.

86
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,160
 I want to read you a couple of verses from James chapter 1,

87
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,520
 starting in verse 14.

88
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,040
 And if you're an Aggie in the room,

89
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,880
 I don't know if there's any here.

90
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,800
 Oh, look at that.

91
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,080
 Hey, how about that?

92
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,760
 I had to stop saying howdy in DC.

93
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,880
 It scared and confused the people.

94
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,240
 So I ditched the howdy.

95
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,640
 But if you're an Aggie, you may have heard some of these ideas

96
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,140
 before.

97
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,300
 They have been refined in my soul over two decades.

98
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,400
 But I believe they're going to be helpful to you.

99
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,680
 And I'm excited about what the Lord has for us tonight.

100
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,880
 So James chapter 1, starting in verse 14, says this.

101
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,200
 "But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed

102
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,440
 by his own desire.

103
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,480
 Then desire, when it's conceived, gives birth to sin.

104
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,840
 And sin, when it's fully grown, brings forth death.

105
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,840
 Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.

106
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,520
 Every good gift and every perfect gift

107
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,360
 is from above, coming down from the Father of lights,

108
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,960
 with whom there's no variation or shadow due to change.

109
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,640
 Of his own will, he brought us forth by the word of truth,

110
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,280
 that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures."

111
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,200
 Well, Lord, I thank you for these few minutes

112
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,900
 around your word.

113
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,960
 And I pray you would help us understand what they mean,

114
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,800
 understand what you're talking about.

115
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,200
 And I pray, God, we wouldn't just understand it,

116
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,480
 but we'd be affected by it.

117
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,960
 That, Lord, I don't know what all our motivations are

118
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,520
 to show up in a place like this.

119
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,040
 Some of us want to turn over a new leaf,

120
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,880
 want to be a better person.

121
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,240
 Some of us just wanted to be with the person who brought us

122
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,880
 here, and this was prerequisite to get with them.

123
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,560
 And here we are.

124
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,400
 I don't know what all brought us here.

125
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,160
 But I know, God, there's an opportunity to hear the thoughts

126
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,920
 of the God who made us and think your thoughts after you,

127
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,240
 feel your feelings after you, and maybe walk with you.

128
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,960
 And I just want to ask you, friend,

129
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,320
 whether this is your normal deal or not, if you're up for it,

130
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,240
 just take a minute and you pray and talk to God.

131
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,120
 And just tell him, teach me tonight, please.

132
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,080
 And then if you would, please pray for me,

133
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,920
 that the Lord would use me and I'd be helpful to you.

134
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:29,720
 Well, Father, we love you and we trust you.

135
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,280
 Use this time, we pray in Jesus' name, amen.

136
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,320
 Well, several years ago, I had the opportunity

137
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,680
 to attend a Navy SEAL training exercise,

138
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,280
 and I watched a group of Navy SEALs

139
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,640
 take down a building that was filled with enemies

140
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,440
 holding hostages.

141
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,920
 And it was a simulation, so they were using

142
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,520
 simunition rounds, paintballs,

143
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,960
 but they're fired out of real guns,

144
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,760
 so they go fast and hard and hurt.

145
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,960
 Now, it was my understanding I would be watching this exercise

146
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,520
 from the safety of an observation deck.

147
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,840
 But I remember as I watched these SEALs kind of stack up

148
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,800
 on the door and begin to lay this debt cord,

149
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,600
 their commanding officer, who I was standing with,

150
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,040
 motioned with me to walk with him,

151
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,600
 and he starts walking towards the door.

152
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,680
 And so as we walk towards it, at one point he stops me

153
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,440
 and he goes, "Hey, I wouldn't get any closer than this

154
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,280
 "if I were you."

155
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,240
 He said, "When they blow that door,

156
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,900
 "sometimes the handle can shoot off like a bullet.

157
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,200
 "I'd stay about right here."

158
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,560
 I was like, "Yeah, fine."

159
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,760
 Like, I wasn't planning on being this close.

160
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,240
 But sure enough, they blew the door open,

161
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
 they went running in, and then he hit me in the chest

162
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
 and went, "Let's go."

163
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,560
 And he went running into that doorway,

164
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,840
 and I went running after him in jeans and a T-shirt.

165
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,680
 And I remember as soon as I did,

166
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,160
 two things struck me immediately, metaphorically speaking.

167
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,920
 The first thing was the chaos of the situation.

168
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,760
 Flashbangs going off, smoke everywhere,

169
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,860
 shots fired, it was bedlam.

170
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,880
 But the second thing that struck me

171
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,320
 was the beauty of their strategy.

172
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,720
 They were aggressive but patient.

173
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,960
 They were graceful but purposeful.

174
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,320
 They would come to an open doorway,

175
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,480
 and two of them with barely a nod would both swing out

176
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,000
 with their guns pointed in opposite directions

177
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,400
 to eliminate any hostiles

178
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,840
 while never being an open target themselves.

179
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,120
 And within seconds, these SEALs had neutralized

180
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,840
 all the enemy, rescued all hostages,

181
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,960
 and taken an environment that had been chaotic

182
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,800
 and brought peace.

183
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,520
 And I remember standing in the midst of that,

184
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,240
 watching that, and I thought,

185
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,040
 "Now that's the Christian life!"

186
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,940
 Or it's supposed to be.

187
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,040
 And you go, "What do you mean by that?"

188
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,240
 Well, I don't know what your spiritual background is,

189
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,280
 but maybe you're here because you wanna turn over

190
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,560
 a new leaf, you've decided, "I wanna be a better person."

191
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,000
 And the moment you decide to do that,

192
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,680
 you realize that happens in the midst

193
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,840
 of the winds of resistance.

194
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,340
 That spirituality tends to play out

195
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,440
 in the context of adversity.

196
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,080
 It's not easy.

197
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,400
 That many of you have experienced that.

198
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,000
 You said, "You know what, I'm gonna turn over a new leaf."

199
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,720
 And then you live into Romans 7.

200
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,760
 The good I wanna do, I'm not doing it.

201
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,680
 And the evil I wanna stop doing, I keep doing that.

202
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,560
 And many of us, if we're honest,

203
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,440
 as we try, maybe in a good faith effort,

204
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,040
 to be more spiritual people,

205
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,200
 we get discouraged by the situation.

206
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
 We just thought it'd be easier.

207
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,800
 And you go, "I don't know what I meant by that."

208
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,920
 Like, I would put my faith in Jesus,

209
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,480
 show up at church, and all of a sudden,

210
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,640
 never struggle anymore, and be happy all the time,

211
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,280
 and fly around, and sprinkle Jesus dust on the people.

212
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,920
 Like, I don't know what I thought.

213
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,560
 But you show up in places like this,

214
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,080
 and many of you maybe grew up in churches

215
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,880
 where they would have testimonies.

216
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,360
 And they would bring someone on stage,

217
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,700
 and they'd walk up there and be like,

218
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,480
 "I just want you all to know,

219
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,920
 "I was addicted to every drug a human can create.

220
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,360
 "And then I put my faith in Jesus,

221
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,720
 "and never struggled again.

222
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,680
 "That addiction was entirely pulled up by the roots."

223
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,720
 And everyone claps, you go, "That's amazing,

224
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,840
 "because God can do that."

225
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,360
 And yet, some of you, you heard that, and you go,

226
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,600
 "He uprooted your addictions?

227
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,800
 "He didn't even prune mine.

228
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,520
 "They're as robust as ever."

229
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,280
 And for some of us, let's be honest,

230
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,920
 that you're not living a very purposeful or meaningful life.

231
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,960
 Because the low-grade hum of constant guilt and failure

232
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,720
 is just running in the background of your whole story.

233
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,640
 And there's not a fire in your chest anymore.

234
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,060
 Already, as a young person with so much in front of you,

235
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,560
 you don't live with a passion,

236
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,520
 because the wet blanket of failure

237
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,240
 is muting any passion you have for God

238
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,720
 or His purpose in your life.

239
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,040
 And some of us, if we're honest,

240
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,780
 the situation has discouraged us.

241
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,600
 It's a struggle, it's adversity.

242
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,380
 And let me tell you, the data is in

243
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,340
 that modern life is not conducive to human flourishing.

244
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,080
 And I don't need to go over and over about that,

245
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,600
 that your generation has the dubious honor

246
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,840
 of being the most anxious and depressed generation on record.

247
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,240
 That's not entirely your fault.

248
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,040
 Cultural forces have pressed in on you

249
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,880
 in strange ways in humanity,

250
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,640
 but it's pushed onto you a discouragement,

251
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,660
 a polarization in the media

252
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,040
 that breeds fear and uncertainty and anger,

253
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,800
 a constant comparison with other people's pristine lives.

254
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,720
 On a screen, the addictive nature

255
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,760
 of our interactions with new technology

256
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,440
 is constantly putting in front of us

257
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,160
 this polarization and comparison.

258
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,640
 In the midst of that onslaught,

259
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,720
 the traditional buffers to stress are gone,

260
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,520
 and so addictions wait to take their place.

261
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,680
 And many of us, if we're honest,

262
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,880
 we look at our lives and we're in a fight,

263
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,840
 and if we're honest, we're not winning.

264
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,040
 And some of you hear that and you go,

265
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,360
 "Ben, I know the situation's hard.

266
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,080
 "I already knew all that."

267
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,260
 Maybe you're a Christian and you go,

268
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,860
 "I've heard all the Bible verses

269
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,580
 "about the armor of God and the struggle and the battle.

270
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,460
 "I know spirituality's a struggle.

271
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,160
 "I understand the situation's hard.

272
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,140
 "Ben, I just need a strategy.

273
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,120
 "I wanna look more like the seals

274
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,020
 "and less like you.

275
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,580
 "I wanna look trained, armed, prepared, successful.

276
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,460
 "I don't wanna be running around in flip-flops

277
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,200
 "going, 'It's smoky in here!'"

278
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,160
 And the strategies you've used thus far are not working.

279
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,280
 Like, I don't know about you, but where I grew up,

280
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,520
 we went to camp every summer.

281
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,800
 And we lived in Texas, we'd drive to this camp in Mississippi

282
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,080
 and this camp was wild.

283
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,360
 I mean, kids were smoking, drinking 40s.

284
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,060
 It was pretty crazy.

285
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,680
 That's not an exaggeration.

286
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,520
 But Thursday night, man, everybody got saved.

287
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:08,400
 'Cause after a couple weeks or days of staying up late

288
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,040
 and late nights, little sleep, malnutritious food

289
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,040
 that had us all in this emotionally volatile state,

290
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,640
 and the band would get us all stirred up,

291
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,880
 and then the speaker would get up

292
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,680
 and he'd get us all fired up.

293
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,940
 And by the end of the last night,

294
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,680
 everyone was crying, locking pinkies,

295
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,080
 swaying, singing "Friends Are Friends Forever."

296
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
 And then right at the emotional pitch,

297
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,040
 it was open mic night.

298
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,500
 And one after one, we would get up there

299
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,200
 and say these big promises

300
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
 of what we were gonna do for God.

301
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,240
 I just want you all to know,

302
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,440
 I'm never gonna sin again!

303
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,680
 We'd be like, I don't think he is.

304
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,280
 He's had such a good week at camp,

305
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,740
 I think it's over for him.

306
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,080
 Next thing, we'd be like, I just want you all to know,

307
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,800
 I'm gonna tell the whole world about Christ!

308
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,040
 And you're like, he is prophesying right now.

309
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,560
 And on and on we would go!

310
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,800
 But there wasn't a one of us that two weeks later

311
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,060
 hadn't broken every promise.

312
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,720
 And we would come worship in here

313
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,520
 and then go home and be surrounded

314
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,160
 by our same addictions in our bedroom

315
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,180
 and go, what's wrong with me?

316
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,480
 This is for the pristine people.

317
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,040
 Things like this are for the pretty people.

318
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,600
 They don't have an ugly life like me,

319
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,720
 so maybe I won't be the worst human being you met,

320
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,360
 but maybe I'm not gonna live the life of purpose

321
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,720
 they keep trying to sell there.

322
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,840
 And let me be honest with you,

323
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,320
 for many of us, you understand life's a struggle.

324
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,460
 It's a struggle.

325
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,400
 And I don't wanna give you a pump up speech.

326
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,940
 It's hard.

327
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,400
 But what I wanna do, in almost an unemotional way,

328
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,800
 is to say if life is a struggle,

329
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,880
 how do you struggle well?

330
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,800
 So let's look at our situation,

331
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,360
 and then I wanna give you a strategy.

332
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,520
 Our situation is that it feels like a war.

333
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,840
 Because it is a war.

334
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,040
 A pursuit of intimacy with the Almighty

335
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,120
 occurs in the context of adversity.

336
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,360
 It does.

337
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,440
 It's interesting, you look at the life of Jesus,

338
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,940
 and as much as Jesus is presented as a lamb and a shepherd,

339
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,900
 he's also called a warrior.

340
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,840
 That his arrival is pictured in the Bible

341
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,960
 as a landed invasion.

342
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,600
 John says in 1 John 3,8,

343
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,780
 the Son of God appeared for this purpose,

344
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,380
 to destroy the works of the devil.

345
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,220
 That Jesus arrived to destroy something.

346
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,780
 The first mention of him is in Genesis 3,15,

347
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,820
 the seed of the woman will crush the head of the serpent.

348
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,180
 The one who deceived us, lied to us, and hurt us,

349
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,260
 the whole river of tragedy flowing out of that garden,

350
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,220
 someone will come to destroy the one who deceived us.

351
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,020
 That's how he's pictured.

352
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,500
 And not only was Jesus's arrival on earth,

353
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,980
 a landed invasion, it was a rescue operation.

354
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,980
 His first sermon in Luke chapter four,

355
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,700
 he stood up, opened the scroll, and said,

356
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,180
 "I am here to proclaim release to the captives."

357
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,500
 He said, "I am here to set prisoners free, watch me."

358
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,440
 And he went to do damage on the kingdom of darkness.

359
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,040
 One of my favorite passages about Jesus' ministries

360
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,740
 in Luke chapter 11, Jesus was asked,

361
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,580
 "Why are you here?

362
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,660
 "What are you here to do?"

363
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,500
 And he told a story.

364
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,900
 He said, "Imagine a strong man, filled with armor,

365
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,260
 "he's got a bunch of gear, no one will mess with him."

366
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,960
 He said, "Now imagine someone stronger, beating him up,

367
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,900
 "stripping off his gear, and stealing his things."

368
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,600
 That's me.

369
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,340
 I don't know if that's how you do evangelism

370
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,940
 with your friends, tell me about Jesus.

371
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,180
 He's like a big dude that beats up a guy

372
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,540
 and steals his stuff, that's my king.

373
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,380
 Try that.

374
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,940
 'Cause that's Luke 11.

375
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,280
 Jesus said, "When a strong man, fully armed,

376
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,160
 "guards his house, his possessions are undisturbed.

377
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,520
 "But when someone stronger than he attacks him

378
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,820
 "and overpowers him, he takes away from him

379
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,620
 "all his armor on which he relied,

380
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,920
 "and distributes his plunder."

381
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,480
 Some of you, why do you wonder why demons

382
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,920
 are always showing up in Jesus' ministry?

383
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,020
 One of my favorite moments is when there's a legion

384
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,560
 of demons, and when they see Jesus,

385
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,140
 they fall down shrieking, and they say,

386
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,420
 "Son of man, have you come to torment us

387
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,060
 "before the appointed time?"

388
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,260
 They knew a beating was coming,

389
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,660
 they just thought he was early.

390
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,140
 And yet you realize, for some of you,

391
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,260
 there are some things in your life,

392
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,140
 that let's just be honest,

393
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,420
 your addictions are stronger than you,

394
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,740
 and your attempts at overcoming them have failed.

395
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,880
 And some of you are here, and you are right at the edge

396
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,260
 of discouragement in life.

397
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,900
 And can I tell you something?

398
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,460
 Your addictions and failures are stronger than you,

399
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,220
 but the good news is, the stronger one is here.

400
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,100
 He is stronger than what's stronger than you.

401
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,620
 And he came as an invasion into the darkness,

402
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,380
 and it was a rescue operation.

403
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,100
 Hebrews 2 says, "Since the children

404
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,340
 "share in flesh and blood, he likewise himself

405
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,340
 "partook of the same, that through his death,

406
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,020
 "he might render powerless him who had power over death,

407
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,860
 "that is, the devil, and might set free

408
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,060
 "those who through fear of death

409
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,420
 "were subject to slavery all their lives."

410
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,780
 He said, "I came to get you,

411
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,120
 "and if sin has led to condemnation and death,

412
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,760
 "I will take on your humanity,

413
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,240
 "I will take on your death, and I will set you free,

414
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,860
 "and transfer you out of the kingdom of darkness

415
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,580
 "into the kingdom of the beloved son."

416
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,180
 That's the gospel, not that you earn the smile of God,

417
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,400
 it's not for sale, but God came running

418
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,020
 into the darkness for you, an invasion,

419
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,540
 and a rescue operation, the king of all kings

420
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,060
 grabbing his subjects out of the kingdom of darkness

421
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,820
 and transferring you into his marvelous light.

422
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,740
 That's the gospel, you've switched kingdoms.

423
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,420
 And I'm mentioning this because the best fighters

424
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,980
 are those who know they've been fought for.

425
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,640
 It's the truth, when you know someone fought for you,

426
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,720
 you're willing to fight for yourself.

427
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,920
 So many kids around the city give up on themselves

428
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,600
 because they never saw a parent, an adult,

429
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,080
 someone who cared, fight for them.

430
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,920
 And let me tell you something,

431
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,000
 you have a king who fought for you.

432
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,560
 And not only is it an invasion and a rescue operation,

433
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,880
 it is an ongoing mission.

434
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,520
 C.S. Lewis said, "Enemy-occupied territory."

435
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,600
 That is what the world is.

436
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,560
 Christianity is the story of how the rightful king has come,

437
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,800
 you may say come in disguise,

438
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,900
 and he's inviting us all to take part

439
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,680
 in his great campaign of sabotage.

440
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,400
 We are in a war, but we're in a war

441
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,480
 where our king has won the decisive victory.

442
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,560
 It's David and Goliath.

443
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,440
 What happened when Goliath came?

444
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,400
 When the Fizzlesteins had invaded Israelite land

445
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,560
 and that massive giant stood over them?

446
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,040
 What did the Israelites do?

447
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,800
 They cowered in fear and shrunk before that great giant.

448
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,200
 And then David stepped forward, and he looked weak,

449
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,960
 he looked small, but through his weakness, what did he do?

450
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,880
 He fought the one that terrified them,

451
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,040
 and he said, "I will fight as your representative.

452
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,580
 "I will be," literally the passage says,

453
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,800
 "the man in between.

454
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,140
 "I will step in, and I will fight for you,

455
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,640
 "and my victory will be for you."

456
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,200
 And he killed that giant.

457
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,320
 And when he hit the dirt, what did the Israelites do?

458
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,080
 They shouted the war cry,

459
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,680
 and they drove the Philistines out of their land.

460
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,880
 And for you and me, what you need to first do is see,

461
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,280
 it's the son of David, Jesus Christ, fought death for you,

462
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,840
 fought condemnation for you.

463
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,940
 You are not condemned.

464
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,200
 Your future is not despair, it is victory in Jesus.

465
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,200
 You need to see the son of David beating death for you,

466
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,420
 beating hell for you, beating the devil for you.

467
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,000
 And when that falls to the ground,

468
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,280
 all these little Philistines of lust, fear, and pride

469
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,400
 in your heart that are real,

470
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,780
 now you can be empowered to drive them out of your heart.

471
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,900
 Because here's the thing, I talk to so many people

472
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,120
 that when they come to Christ, they go,

473
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,580
 I thought some of these desires would go away.

474
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,780
 I have some longings for some broken things.

475
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,760
 I've got some addictions.

476
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,040
 I just thought he would take away.

477
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,680
 Maybe Christianity doesn't work.

478
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,360
 And I say, no, you've misread this thing.

479
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,160
 You haven't been freed from the fight,

480
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,240
 you've been freed for it.

481
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,500
 Before you were just a victim,

482
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,520
 now you have the power to be a victor.

483
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,340
 That Jesus has won the decisive victory.

484
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,280
 There is no more condemnation for those who are in Christ,

485
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,640
 Jesus, and yet he has allowed us to remain on this earth,

486
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,020
 and he's empowering us to beat back the darkness

487
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,240
 that once held you captive.

488
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,720
 Before you were just a victim,

489
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,840
 now you have the chance to be a victor in Jesus' name.

490
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,140
 It's master and commander.

491
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,320
 I don't know if you've watched that movie

492
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,440
 starring Russell Crowe.

493
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,080
 He and his team are tasked with taking out

494
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,840
 Napoleon's most feared frigate,

495
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,580
 and at the end of the movie,

496
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,760
 they disable his main mast with their cannons,

497
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,580
 they board the ship,

498
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,320
 they're fighting through all these French people.

499
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,040
 Down into the hold, they break open the chains,

500
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
 free all these prisoners, huzzah!

501
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
 Which is how British people get excited.

502
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,540
 And as they're running out of these prison walls,

503
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,660
 the hero has come, defeated our enemy, and set them free.

504
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,560
 When the chains break and the doors open,

505
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,080
 as they exit, they're each handed a sword,

506
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,520
 because you've been set free,

507
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,400
 but not from the fight, for it.

508
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,560
 And that's the same with you, and same with me.

509
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,320
 It's an ongoing mission.

510
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,820
 And so for now, those who are in Christ Jesus,

511
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,400
 who've put their faith in him,

512
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,620
 the spiritual life is one movement with two parts.

513
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,120
 It's one movement with two parts.

514
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,320
 It's a movement away from ways of thinking

515
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,920
 and ways of feeling and living

516
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,440
 that isolate us from intimacy with God.

517
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,920
 And it's a movement towards ways of thinking

518
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,000
 and feeling and living that promote an intimacy with God

519
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,100
 that Christ purchased.

520
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,920
 Old school theologians have a word for this.

521
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,120
 They call this movement sanctification.

522
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,600
 Sanctify is built off the word holy, which means set apart.

523
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
 And you hear both parts in that.

524
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,440
 Set apart away from some things,

525
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,560
 and set apart for some things.

526
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,600
 Like my wife is holy unto me.

527
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,040
 She's set apart from all the rest of you fools,

528
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,240
 can't touch her.

529
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,720
 Set apart only to me.

530
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,200
 Some of you have a coffee mug like this, right?

531
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,840
 It is holy unto your lips.

532
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,440
 No pagan lips may touch it, right?

533
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,740
 Away and towards, one movement, two parts.

534
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,940
 Theologians had big names for these two pieces.

535
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,000
 They called this mortification.

536
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,360
 There are ways of thinking, ways of feeling,

537
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,840
 ways of living, places I used to go, things I used to do,

538
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,840
 I now mortify, I now kill.

539
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,920
 I used to do 'em, some of my friends still do,

540
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,640
 but because of my allegiance to Jesus,

541
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,960
 I don't live here anymore.

542
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,480
 And they call this piece vivification.

543
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,640
 There's other ways of thinking, ways of feeling,

544
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,440
 ways of living that I wanna vivify,

545
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,420
 I wanna help bring to life.

546
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,240
 If you were using gardening imagery,

547
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
 this is the pulling up of weeds.

548
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,880
 There's just ways of living that don't belong

549
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,320
 in my life anymore, they cost too much, I don't want 'em.

550
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,240
 And there are ways of living I wanna promote.

551
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,440
 They help me be the person I know I'm meant to be.

552
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,040
 I wanna nourish and feed and see those flourish.

553
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,320
 If you were using dating imagery,

554
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,120
 this would be me cultivating intimacy with my wife,

555
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,560
 like taking her on dates to restaurants without TVs

556
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,360
 so I can listen with my face.

557
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,920
 [audience laughing]

558
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,360
 This would be not doing things that hurt our intimacy,

559
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,980
 like yelling at her or dating other women.

560
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,320
 I don't do these things.

561
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,980
 I do these things, right, away and towards.

562
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,300
 Now, before we move to our strategy, let me be clear.

563
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,560
 What I'm not saying is,

564
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,960
 so this is the devil side of the stage, kids, okay?

565
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,920
 And that's the God side,

566
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,640
 so you gotta get on that God side, everybody.

567
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,520
 That's not what I'm saying.

568
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,480
 Because that makes it sound like God is over here

569
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,840
 waiting for you to get your crap together.

570
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,000
 And that's not how it works.

571
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,660
 The Bible says that he will never leave you

572
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,760
 and he'll never forsake you.

573
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,860
 My wife's not gonna leave me,

574
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,200
 but I can be standing physically right next to her

575
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,800
 but feel miles apart because we haven't done the work

576
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,320
 to cultivate the intimacy that we covenanted with together.

577
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,480
 Do you see it?

578
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,720
 So the fight of spirituality is a fight

579
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
 for unrestrained intimacy

580
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,280
 with the one who gave his life for you.

581
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,280
 Flee youthful lust, pursue righteousness,

582
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,600
 along with those who call it to God out of a pure heart.

583
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,760
 That's what Paul told young Timothy.

584
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,000
 So what's our strategy?

585
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,720
 Well, we gotta understand that this does not happen

586
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,600
 in a vacuum, that we have an enemy who hates our king

587
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,760
 and so he hates you.

588
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,240
 So I remember my first day of middle school.

589
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,380
 I was very excited.

590
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,440
 I was gonna ride the bus to school with my older brother

591
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,200
 and my older brother by every measure was endlessly cool.

592
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,640
 And so I remember when we got on the bus,

593
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,720
 he walked to the back of the bus

594
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,600
 and so I just started walking to the back of the bus

595
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,040
 'cause he's cool and sits in the back.

596
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,200
 So I'm cool by proxy, so off I go.

597
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,800
 And I remember I'm walking to the back

598
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,880
 and as I do it, this kid just stands up in front of me

599
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,360
 and puts his face right in my face.

600
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,320
 And this is before I knew that this is what some guys do

601
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,160
 when they wanna fight.

602
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,400
 I remember I decided he had proximity issues,

603
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,520
 like why are our noses touching?

604
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,360
 What's happening?

605
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,320
 [audience laughing]

606
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,120
 And I remember he looked at me and he was like,

607
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,160
 are you Cole Stewart's brother?

608
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,560
 I said, yeah.

609
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,520
 He said, I hate your brother.

610
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,800
 I was like, okay.

611
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,080
 [audience laughing]

612
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,720
 And what it turns out is this kid was, Marvin was a bully.

613
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,160
 Got some emotional needs met by picking on other kids.

614
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,780
 There was just one problem.

615
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,960
 He had decided to play football.

616
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,120
 And my brother played football.

617
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,040
 And there was one day at practice

618
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,800
 where my brother was running the ball

619
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,080
 and Marvin attempted to tackle him

620
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,140
 and my brother hit him so hard

621
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,520
 that Marvin went flying through the air

622
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,140
 and made squealing sounds like a piglet.

623
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,740
 [audience laughing]

624
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,440
 Which when you're a bully, it kinda cramps your style, right?

625
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,120
 So fast forward back to the bus

626
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,520
 and he says, I hate your brother.

627
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,280
 And then he says, so I hate you.

628
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,920
 And then he put his finger on my face and said,

629
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,880
 you look good with a cigarette burn here.

630
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,820
 He pushed my face.

631
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,760
 And then from behind him, we heard my brother's voice go,

632
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,600
 Marvin!

633
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,760
 He kinda straightened up and he sat back down.

634
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,680
 But as I walked by, I said,

635
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,780
 it's gonna be a long year, little brother.

636
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,080
 Now let me ask you something.

637
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,520
 Why was he being mean to me?

638
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,480
 [audience laughing]

639
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,920
 I didn't do anything to him.

640
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,360
 I didn't try to go to school.

641
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,360
 'Cause I looked like the one who shamed him, that's why.

642
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,800
 And if your allegiance is to Jesus Christ,

643
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,200
 the Bible says he made a public spectacle of the enemy,

644
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,720
 triumphing over him, stripping him naked

645
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,880
 when he stole his plunder, which is you, right?

646
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,340
 And so you are not free from temptation.

647
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,520
 When you come to Christ,

648
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,440
 you've got an even bigger target on your back.

649
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,440
 Because the devil can't attack God in a frontal assault,

650
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,760
 but he can twist the knife in him by coming after his kids.

651
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,020
 And that's what he does.

652
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,180
 That's where you are.

653
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,800
 So let's talk about what he knows and what he does,

654
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,520
 then we'll talk about what we know and what we do.

655
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,120
 What he knows is he knows you.

656
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,160
 Specifically, he knows your wiring.

657
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,180
 He knows you have a mind to think with,

658
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,840
 he knows you have a heart to feel with,

659
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,480
 and you have a will, a reasoning mechanism,

660
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,040
 inclinations and disinclinations, and the ability to act.

661
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,280
 A mind, a heart, and a body, right?

662
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,780
 And he knows your tendencies,

663
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,400
 the particular things you're into.

664
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,140
 He's watched the film on you.

665
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,240
 So what's his strategy?

666
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,540
 What he wants is for you to take a willful step

667
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,100
 away from the intimacy with God

668
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,260
 and purpose in life you were created for.

669
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,680
 Why would you do that?

670
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,040
 Why would you participate in activities

671
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,200
 that are destructive to your soul and your purpose

672
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,920
 and the brief life you have on earth?

673
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,360
 Why would you go along with that?

674
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,400
 To get you to do this,

675
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,600
 to walk away from the God who gave you everything,

676
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,560
 he has to make that look attractive.

677
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,420
 So he has to create an environment

678
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,080
 where he'll solicit thoughts to the mind

679
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,680
 to stir the affections, so you'll enact the will.

680
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,160
 That you will twist the knife in God

681
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,000
 by purposely taking a step away

682
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,360
 from the intimacy that Christ purchased, right?

683
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,400
 Now some of you go, well, Ben,

684
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,080
 where are you getting this from?

685
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,560
 I'm getting it from the passage I read in James.

686
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,240
 But each one is tempted when he is lured

687
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,840
 and enticed by his own desire.

688
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,000
 This environment is called temptation,

689
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,640
 where I am lured, that's my mind's attention,

690
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,720
 and enticed, that's my heart's affection.

691
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,560
 And then when I enact the will, it brings forth sin.

692
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,260
 And sin, when it's fully grown, brings forth death.

693
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,460
 I arrive a place I'm never meant to be.

694
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,360
 Do you see it?

695
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,360
 That's his strategy.

696
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,700
 So I've said this many times.

697
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,640
 Ladies, you might be getting ready for work

698
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,040
 or school in the morning,

699
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,600
 and the thought will be solicited to your mind, I'm single.

700
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,920
 And as that thought crosses your mind and you engage it,

701
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,280
 you go, that is correct.

702
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,680
 I am neither married nor currently dating anyone.

703
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,960
 But as that thought is continually solicited to your mind

704
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,360
 and it consults your affections, your affections go,

705
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,640
 but I wanna be with someone.

706
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,480
 I don't wanna be alone.

707
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,960
 And then a romantic song comes on.

708
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,680
 And as it plays, you're like, I wanna be with someone.

709
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,680
 And then you start to drive to work

710
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,200
 and you see couples walking hand in hand,

711
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,000
 and you see the animals going two by two,

712
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,660
 and you go, everyone's got someone but me.

713
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,580
 And while you're in that moment

714
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,280
 where your attention is grabbed and affections are stirred,

715
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
 you'll be propositioned with an idea,

716
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,820
 and you'll date a loser.

717
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:26,700
 He's beneath you morally.

718
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,660
 He is not interested in the interests of your king,

719
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,860
 but you're so caught up,

720
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,060
 you actually believe this is the best you can do.

721
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,780
 And let me warn you, ladies,

722
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,980
 a whole cascading river of tragedies await you

723
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,380
 at the end of that decision.

724
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,820
 Or guys, you'll be getting ready for bed at night,

725
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,780
 and the thought will be solicited to your mind,

726
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,660
 you should get online and look at naked things.

727
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,380
 And as it consults your affections, you go,

728
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,980
 naked things, okay.

729
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,920
 That's about it for you.

730
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,820
 But notice in the passage,

731
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,660
 it says each one is tempted, right?

732
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,180
 It's coming for all of us.

733
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,080
 It's the height of insanity to say he's not coming for you.

734
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,300
 The best self-knowledge you can have is knowing

735
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,140
 if he's coming for us, how does he get me?

736
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,940
 When each one is tempted by his own lust, his own desires,

737
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,900
 he tailor makes them for us, right?

738
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,540
 He even calls them a lure.

739
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,780
 What do you do with a lure?

740
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,580
 If you wanna catch a fish,

741
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,060
 you wanna bob it in front of them,

742
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,740
 and you don't just wanna get their attention,

743
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,260
 you wanna grab their attention.

744
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,180
 I mean, break them off mid-conversation

745
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,100
 with their fish buddies.

746
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,700
 And so maybe you present a frog,

747
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,640
 and you swim it along sideways

748
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,680
 so it looks wounded and delicious,

749
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,320
 and you wanna get his attention,

750
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,700
 and he's like, anyway, so I said, well, hello, right?

751
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,280
 And you don't just wanna get his attention,

752
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,160
 you wanna stir his affections.

753
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,040
 And then when he enacts the will,

754
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,080
 you got him.

755
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,000
 He never even saw the hook.

756
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,840
 Never even crossed his mind

757
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,440
 there was a sentient being behind all this, right?

758
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,940
 And yet some of you may go, a frog?

759
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,900
 Really?

760
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,180
 That's what does it for you?

761
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,740
 Gross.

762
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,960
 Like that turns you on?

763
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,940
 Ew.

764
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,300
 Like I don't even know how you can call yourself

765
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,740
 a real fish if you're tempted by that.

766
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,100
 And that's okay.

767
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,860
 He'll just get a different lure for you,

768
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,760
 and you'll go, ooh, shiny, and off you go, right?

769
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:35,460
 Each one is tempted when he is lured by his own desire.

770
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,300
 Do you see it?

771
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,120
 And the best self-knowledge you can have

772
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,920
 is how does he get me?

773
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,520
 Sun Tzu wrote in "The Art of War,"

774
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,640
 "If you know your enemy and know yourself,

775
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,140
 "you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.

776
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,440
 "If you know neither your enemy nor yourself,

777
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,320
 "you will succumb to every battle."

778
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,320
 Paul told young Timothy,

779
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,020
 "Watch your life and your doctrine closely."

780
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,920
 Watch your doctrine, know what you believe, Timothy,

781
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,000
 and watch your life.

782
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,840
 Be a student of you to save both yourself and your heroes.

783
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,040
 There are people who look to you,

784
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,640
 and some of you have been deeply hurt

785
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,920
 because someone you look to as an inspiration

786
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,380
 did not watch their life closely,

787
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,600
 and they bought into this,

788
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,720
 and it didn't just hurt their life, it hurt you.

789
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,240
 And don't make the mistake of thinking

790
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,240
 you don't influence other people.

791
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,860
 This is how he gets us.

792
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,320
 Don't let shame block strategic thinking.

793
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,980
 This is how the enemy works on you.

794
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,840
 Some of the best self-knowledge you can have

795
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,340
 is how does he get me?

796
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,880
 So now, what do we do?

797
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,840
 Let me give you three things quickly.

798
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,080
 The first thing we do once we know this,

799
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,040
 Jesus says in Matthew 26, 41,

800
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,920
 "Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation."

801
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,760
 Notice what he says.

802
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,800
 He doesn't say watch and pray

803
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,280
 that you don't enter into sin,

804
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,400
 willfully stepping away from intimacy with God.

805
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,920
 He says, "If this, the solicitation to the mind

806
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,560
 "for the stirring of the affections always leads to this,"

807
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,360
 he says, "Watch and pray

808
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,480
 "that you may not enter into temptation.

809
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,320
 "If this leads to this, let me get away from this."

810
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,400
 Number one is we eliminate the moment.

811
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,640
 Where is the moment he gets me?

812
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,880
 So I remember I had a buddy tell me years ago

813
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,320
 that he had a friend come to him

814
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,400
 and tell him that he and his girl were in some trouble,

815
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,040
 that they were getting in fights,

816
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,320
 they were arguing a lot,

817
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,240
 and those fights became shouting matches,

818
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,360
 and they had become physical.

819
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,180
 And my buddy told him,

820
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:27,880
 "You never put your hands on a wife in a hurtful way,"

821
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,280
 and said, "Hey, we need to come around you.

822
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,800
 "This needs to stop."

823
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,520
 But then he began to talk to the guy.

824
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,960
 How does it happen?

825
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
 Start thinking about it.

826
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,040
 You don't just start here.

827
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,880
 The guy's like, "I don't know."

828
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,020
 He's like, "No, think about it.

829
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,260
 "What's the path that leads you to this moment?"

830
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,280
 And as the guy thought, he was like,

831
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,580
 "Well, you know, it's like every Tuesday night

832
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,780
 "we go to this bar, and we're drinking there,

833
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,560
 "and she never wears as much clothes as I want her to,

834
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,100
 "and she knows it bothers me.

835
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,180
 "She does it anyway.

836
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,100
 "Guys start hitting on her,

837
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,520
 "and she doesn't rebuff their advances like I wanted to.

838
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,160
 "So I get mad, and she gets mad,

839
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,100
 "and she makes a little comment,

840
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,040
 "and I make comments back,

841
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,800
 "and it escalates, and we get home,

842
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,260
 "and it escalates even more."

843
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,120
 My friend said, "Well, look,

844
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,020
 "we need to surround you as a community to help you all.

845
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,040
 "We need to get this figured out.

846
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,400
 "There's some counseling that needs to be involved.

847
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,600
 "There's all this, but let's just start with

848
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,260
 "if this moment always leads to that moment,

849
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:22,100
 "maybe y'all don't need to go to that bar together anymore."

850
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,800
 And he said it never crossed the guy's mind.

851
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,480
 He was like, "But it's Tequila Tuesday.

852
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,560
 (audience laughing)

853
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,260
 "It's not where it's sending over.

854
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,500
 "I'll talk to guys all the time

855
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,300
 "that struggle with pornography,

856
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,160
 "and I absolutely hate it.

857
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,000
 "And when I say that,

858
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,560
 "I don't want you to get hit by a wave of shame at all.

859
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,100
 "I hate porn because I love you,

860
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,840
 "and I see what it costs so many people.

861
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,060
 "I see what it's done to you,

862
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,600
 "and you were hit with a tsunami of it when you were kids.

863
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,240
 "It's not fair, it's not right,

864
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,320
 "and you're the first generation

865
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,300
 "that's had to deal with it the way you've had to.

866
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,500
 "It's not your fault.

867
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,840
 "It is your problem, and you must fight.

868
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,820
 "And yet I'll talk to many guys that struggle with it,

869
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,660
 "and they'll come to me

870
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,880
 "'cause they don't like what it's doing to them.

871
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,920
 "They don't like how it steals

872
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,380
 "a sense of agency from their chest.

873
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,880
 "And I'll say, 'Well, let's go to war on it, man.

874
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,720
 "'Let's talk about it.

875
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,120
 "'Where does it get you?'

876
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,920
 "When my bedroom, late at night,

877
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,200
 "I got my phone by my bed, and I can't stop."

878
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,500
 Like, man, Romans 16 says make no provision for the flesh.

879
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,820
 You're putting the world wide web next to your head

880
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,960
 at your most vulnerable moment.

881
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,360
 That's like an alcoholic pouring a glass of scotch

882
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,760
 every night and setting it on the nightstand

883
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,600
 and going, "No, I'm not gonna drink you.

884
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,000
 "That's a bad strategy."

885
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,840
 I said, "So there's more that needs to happen.

886
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,100
 "Usually you're going to this thing

887
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,420
 "to obliterate bad feelings,

888
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,380
 "and we gotta kinda deal with some of the emotional pain

889
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,520
 "that leads you to that release.

890
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,720
 "There's deeper work to be done.

891
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,300
 "But maybe before we do that, we just gotta sober you up.

892
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,980
 "And so this leads to that.

893
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,920
 "Eliminate this.

894
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,160
 "Get your phone out of your bedroom.

895
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,520
 "And I'll talk to guys that are like,

896
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,840
 "'Huh, that's my alarm clock.

897
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,980
 "'Well, then buy an alarm clock.'

898
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,580
 "They practically give 'em away.

899
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,720
 "It's not worth sinning over.

900
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,700
 "You have agency over your technology.

901
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,800
 "Don't be a victim to 'em.

902
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,000
 "Be the master of it.

903
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,440
 "You're the master of your life.

904
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,920
 "And so go to war on it.

905
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,380
 "And if you need to get radical,

906
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,060
 "Jesus said, 'If your eye caused you to sin,

907
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,360
 "'pluck your eye out.'"

908
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,560
 Now, he wasn't saying actually pluck your eye out,

909
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,720
 'cause you could lust with the other eye.

910
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,680
 Or if you pluck 'em both out,

911
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,900
 you could lust just in your brain, right?

912
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,000
 But what he was saying is for some of you,

913
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,360
 you're just not thinking creatively or radically enough.

914
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,680
 One of my favorite passages is Hebrews,

915
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,520
 where he's talking to people

916
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,120
 who are wrestling deeply with sin,

917
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,800
 and the writer of Hebrew goes,

918
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,920
 "In your struggle against sin,

919
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,760
 "you haven't resisted to the point of shedding blood."

920
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,280
 What an encouraging letter.

921
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,880
 "Ah, you're not even bleeding yet!"

922
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,920
 You're like, "Oh man, we're like martyrs."

923
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,840
 But then he tells 'em,

924
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,500
 "But don't you know God is disciplining you

925
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,200
 "'cause you're sons?"

926
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,280
 And five times he calls 'em sons, sons, sons, sons.

927
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,200
 So many of you have such soft external barriers.

928
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,480
 Maybe you got an accountability group

929
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,040
 where you confess where you're struggling,

930
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,000
 but by struggling, you mean submit instantly.

931
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,480
 Oh, okay.

932
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,680
 That's not a struggle.

933
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,320
 That's called instant submission.

934
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:11,200
 And the reality is you've got soft boundaries,

935
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,400
 but you're very hard on yourself.

936
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,320
 And Hebrews is the opposite.

937
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,160
 Get harder boundaries, make war,

938
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,560
 but never for a minute disbelieve

939
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,840
 you are sons, sons, sons, sons, sons.

940
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,200
 You're dearly loved, so let's fight.

941
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,280
 That's the idea.

942
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,960
 I eliminate the moment.

943
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,320
 The second thing is I paddle downstream.

944
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,920
 Before I engage in a particular act,

945
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,760
 I look and see where it would lead me,

946
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,120
 and is that a place I want to go?

947
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,760
 That's James' advice.

948
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,720
 When desire is conceived, it gives birth to sin,

949
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,860
 and sin, when it's fully grown, brings forth death.

950
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,680
 Before I engage in an act, let me see where it leads.

951
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,360
 Now, the interesting thing about that is,

952
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,160
 in Greek, the language this was written in,

953
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,260
 nouns have gender, masculine, feminine, like Spanish,

954
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,880
 and desire is a feminine word,

955
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,080
 and so he's playing on this idea.

956
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,600
 He's actually not using fishing imagery.

957
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,400
 He's using sexual imagery.

958
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,360
 He's saying if you unite with desire,

959
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,620
 if you jump in bed with desire,

960
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:14,200
 she conceives and she gives birth to sin,

961
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,360
 a rebellion against God.

962
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,200
 And some of you hear that and you go,

963
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,080
 "Well, I don't care if I'm sinning."

964
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,840
 But sin is a feminine too, and it says about sin,

965
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,960
 she brings forth death.

966
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,480
 She has a baby too, called death.

967
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,160
 It won't bring you the life you think it will,

968
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,640
 and I counsel many people who engaged in activities

969
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,960
 they thought would bring life,

970
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,700
 and it took far more than it gave,

971
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,400
 and the reality is to look and see.

972
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,600
 Before I take part in a particular act,

973
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,920
 let me look downstream.

974
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,720
 Alcoholics call it thinking through the drink,

975
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,080
 'cause there's that voice in your head that says,

976
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,800
 you can just have one, you can handle it,

977
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,720
 and you have to go, "No, no, no, no, listen here.

978
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,980
 "I know where that one drink will lead.

979
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,840
 "It'll lead to drink two, and drink three,

980
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,480
 "and drink four, and I'll wake up tomorrow

981
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,480
 "and someone will have to fill me in

982
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,840
 "on some of the crazy things I did,

983
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,760
 "and you know what?

984
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,760
 "I just, I'm not gonna go here."

985
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,340
 So you look downstream and see where it leads.

986
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,680
 Is that a place I wanna be?

987
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,920
 I used to preach for a friend.

988
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,980
 He had the prayer closet in his office,

989
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,720
 and a little closet where you'd pray before preaching,

990
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,920
 and then as you're leaving,

991
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,640
 all along the wall outside the door

992
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,640
 were newspaper clippings of ministers

993
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,320
 who had fallen out of ministry 'cause of moral failure.

994
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,800
 Very morbid wall.

995
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,640
 I'm like, "Ah, man, is this like

996
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,080
 "some sort of sick fascination?

997
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,480
 "Like, what is this?"

998
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,000
 And then I realized, no, this isn't like

999
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 some like beautiful mind, like, hmm.

1000
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,760
 You know, he was just, for him, he knew in ministry,

1001
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,800
 it is such an exertion of energy,

1002
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,080
 emotionally and physically,

1003
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,240
 and sometimes when you're depleted, you feel entitled,

1004
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,040
 and if you don't prioritize a healthy release in your life,

1005
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,960
 the enemy will always lead to a destructive one,

1006
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,680
 and he says, "I've seen too many ministers on this wall

1007
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,940
 "start to believe, I need a break, I need a break,

1008
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,560
 "and the devil will present them an oasis

1009
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,480
 "of another woman's arms, and they'll destroy their ministry

1010
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,600
 "and their influence and their families."

1011
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,400
 He said, "So I put these pictures on the wall,"

1012
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
 and there was one right at the eye level

1013
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,000
 as you're walking out, and it was circled a picture

1014
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,960
 of a pastor who had been like doing some hardcore drugs

1015
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,000
 and sleeping with prostitutes,

1016
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,920
 but was still denying it when this photo

1017
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,120
 was taken by the paparazzi.

1018
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,000
 So this paparazzi's taking photos of him and his wife

1019
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,520
 in his car, and you see on his face,

1020
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,360
 he's still spinning the story like, "They weren't my drugs."

1021
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,600
 You know, like he's kind of got this happy face,

1022
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,480
 but my friend had circled his wife's face

1023
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,000
 and wrote next to it, "Look at her eyes,"

1024
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,880
 because this guy was still trying to spin the story

1025
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,400
 and play the game, and she couldn't hide it,

1026
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,320
 and you saw that she was just looking at nothing

1027
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,440
 or a thousand miles away,

1028
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,840
 but she didn't want to play the game anymore,

1029
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,880
 and my friend looked at that and said,

1030
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,060
 "You know what, I put this next to me

1031
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,640
 "because the devil will whisper that in this woman's arms,

1032
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,120
 "I'll find life," and I'm not coming after women.

1033
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,760
 Women, men, we wrestle with this.

1034
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,160
 We're talking about desires here,

1035
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,680
 some desires that lead to death,

1036
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,460
 and he said, "I'm gonna believe that getting into some

1037
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,900
 "of these illicit relationships will bring life to me,

1038
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,220
 "but let me just look downstream

1039
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,720
 "because sin looks less sexy in the cold light of day.

1040
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,360
 "I don't wanna use women like that."

1041
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,800
 And so before you jump in the boat,

1042
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,040
 listen to hear the crashing waterfall

1043
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,700
 and say, "If I don't wanna go there,

1044
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,560
 "let me stop it up here.

1045
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,320
 "I've never fought a lion, but if I had to,

1046
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,800
 "I wanna fight a baby one."

1047
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,700
 It's better to fight it when it's little,

1048
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:32,160
 so don't let your desires get to full strength.

1049
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,680
 Cut it off early.

1050
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,000
 Look downstream.

1051
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,920
 And the last one is you paddle upstream.

1052
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,720
 Trace it back.

1053
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,020
 Why do we have these suicidal addictions

1054
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,560
 to things we know are destructive?

1055
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,760
 What gives that river of our addictions their power?

1056
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,120
 Well, you gotta paddle upstream,

1057
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,400
 and that's what James says.

1058
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,840
 He says, "Don't be deceived, my dear beloved brothers."

1059
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,560
 He said, "Downstream from temptation is destruction,

1060
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,520
 "but upstream is deception."

1061
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,240
 There's a lie that leads us to engage in these activities

1062
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,780
 that we think will be life-enhancing,

1063
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,920
 but then notice what he does.

1064
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,960
 He doesn't say the lie is,

1065
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,760
 "These things won't give you the life you thought they will.

1066
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,940
 "These things won't really work.

1067
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,940
 "These relationships, these drugs, these ideas,

1068
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,880
 "these aren't really gonna work."

1069
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,720
 He doesn't say that.

1070
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,920
 He says, "Don't be deceived.

1071
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,540
 "Every good and perfect gift comes down

1072
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,860
 "from your Father above,

1073
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,720
 "in whom there's no shadow or shifting due to change."

1074
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,820
 He says, "The lie that launches a million sins

1075
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,320
 "is that God is not a good dad who will take care of you,

1076
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,100
 "that if I don't think God will really meet my needs,

1077
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,600
 "I will go to many broken places to have them met.

1078
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,760
 "If I don't think he really cares about my love life,

1079
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,520
 "then I'll just do it my own way and walk away from his

1080
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,600
 "because I don't trust his heart."

1081
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,080
 And so the lie that launches a million sins

1082
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,960
 is that God is not a good dad who loves you.

1083
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,240
 And for many of you, can I tell you,

1084
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,800
 a million sins will lose their power

1085
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,440
 if you fight the battle here to know,

1086
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,800
 my beloved brothers,

1087
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,320
 every good and perfect gift comes down from your Father.

1088
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,080
 And then he says, "Of his own will,

1089
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,040
 "out of his thelemai, his desire,

1090
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,600
 "he brought you forth."

1091
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,760
 Sin isn't the only one having babies.

1092
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,080
 He brought you forth by the word of his truth.

1093
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,140
 You heard the good news of Jesus,

1094
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,600
 you believed it, and God brought you to life.

1095
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,420
 Why?

1096
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,040
 Because he wanted to,

1097
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,640
 because he loves you,

1098
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,040
 because he delights in you.

1099
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,860
 I know for me, and I've said this many times,

1100
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,400
 it's controversial in some circles,

1101
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,840
 I never really liked the song "How He Loves Us."

1102
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,320
 And I used to wrestle with that.

1103
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,320
 Why do I not like that song, "How He Loves Us?"

1104
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,040
 I'm like, is it the Doppler effect way we sing it?

1105
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,880
 ♪ How he loves us ♪

1106
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,320
 ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪

1107
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,400
 Like, it's not that.

1108
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,240
 Like, is it the lyrics?

1109
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,380
 Nah, I'm not a tree.

1110
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,640
 And I thought, no,

1111
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,900
 it's because they make you repeat it a bunch.

1112
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,080
 Oh, how he loves us.

1113
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,360
 Oh, how he loves me.

1114
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,400
 Oh, how he loves me.

1115
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,080
 And as someone from a divorced home,

1116
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,980
 it sounds insulting, not encouraging.

1117
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,960
 Oh, how he loves me.

1118
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,800
 Oh, how he loves me.

1119
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,760
 And I used to not like it,

1120
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,140
 because theologically I'd get it right on a quiz

1121
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,200
 that he loved me, and in my heart,

1122
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,840
 I thought I was a disappointment.

1123
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,960
 Then I remember when we had our first kid,

1124
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,240
 I would take like the two, 3 a.m. shift

1125
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,360
 of holding this baby.

1126
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,080
 And I remember sitting in the quiet in my living room,

1127
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,320
 holding my little girl,

1128
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,840
 and suddenly feeling this pain in my chest,

1129
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,240
 like my chest was caving in.

1130
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,080
 I was like, oh my gosh,

1131
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,920
 like, is this a heart attack?

1132
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,880
 I'm like, what is this?

1133
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,840
 And I was like, it's love!

1134
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,440
 (audience laughing)

1135
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,280
 For you!

1136
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,560
 And then I instantly felt the barriers of language.

1137
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,440
 I'm like, I don't know how to express this feeling.

1138
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,900
 Like, no word encaptures it.

1139
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,000
 The word love is too small.

1140
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,640
 To say I'd die for you is, of course, obvious.

1141
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,780
 There's no poem, there's no song,

1142
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,800
 there's nothing that could wrap up this feeling

1143
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,160
 that's bursting out of me for this little person,

1144
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,840
 and you couldn't understand it anyway,

1145
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,240
 'cause you're a baby, you don't even speak English yet,

1146
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,600
 and then I'm like, and you're not even doing anything!

1147
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,240
 You're not pitching in,

1148
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,780
 you're not complimenting my sermons,

1149
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,360
 you are nothing but noise and need!

1150
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,920
 But oh, I wish there was some way

1151
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,920
 for this little baby mind to understand

1152
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,800
 what's exploding in your father's chest

1153
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,480
 of how deeply and passionately and inexhaustibly I love you.

1154
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,360
 And I remember in that moment,

1155
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,160
 I just felt like God did one of those little moves on me

1156
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,460
 where he's like, hey, Ben,

1157
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,820
 do you think you're a better father than me?

1158
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,720
 You think you have a greater capacity to love your children

1159
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,920
 than I have to love you?

1160
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,760
 And look, victimization is powerful.

1161
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,900
 You can justify a lot of self-destructive behaviors

1162
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,600
 if you buy the identity that you're a victim.

1163
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,920
 And some of us really have been hurt,

1164
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,280
 and you've been victimized.

1165
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,360
 But for me, I had held on to some bitterness

1166
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,160
 and anger and rage, and I had to realize,

1167
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,880
 yeah, there's some sad things that happen,

1168
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,720
 but you know what?

1169
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,400
 I am dearly and profoundly loved by a father,

1170
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,080
 and I had to repent of an unbiblically low view

1171
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,080
 of the love of God.

1172
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,120
 And that didn't take every addiction away,

1173
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,840
 but man, it broke a lot of their power.

1174
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,600
 To go, I wake up and I don't need to run to these

1175
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,880
 to obliterate bad feelings.

1176
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,180
 I don't need to run to them to feel good.

1177
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,180
 I got you.

1178
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,140
 I got a king.

1179
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,340
 I got a father who loves me.

1180
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,180
 Let me tell you something.

1181
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,980
 If you decided you hate me,

1182
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,020
 let's say you made that your goal.

1183
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,980
 Summer 2023, destroy Ben Stewart.

1184
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,600
 Let me tell you how to do it.

1185
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,500
 You would grab the face of one of my little daughters

1186
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,740
 and say, man, you're a disappointment to your dad.

1187
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:33,380
 Gosh, I mean, like, he's gonna love you

1188
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,440
 because that's his thing and he loves everybody,

1189
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,880
 but you are so exhausting.

1190
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,900
 And it'd be better if you just left.

1191
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,640
 He's not gonna say it, but he doesn't really want you here.

1192
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,700
 Just go.

1193
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,840
 Go somewhere else.

1194
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,480
 Go find love in somebody else's arms.

1195
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,960
 Go find answers in some other book.

1196
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,160
 Go, go someplace else.

1197
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,040
 Just get out of here.

1198
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,720
 You say that craziness to my child,

1199
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,000
 you will enact wrath in my heart.

1200
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,400
 And you need to understand that's what the enemy does to you.

1201
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,100
 Don't be deceived, my beloved brothers.

1202
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,020
 Every good and perfect gift comes from your father above

1203
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,060
 and whom there's no shadow or shifting due to change

1204
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,060
 and of his own will.

1205
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,100
 He brought you forth by the word of truth.

1206
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,420
 You fight hell with truth.

1207
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,260
 You fight temptation with love.

1208
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,420
 No, I got a father who loves me.

1209
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,260
 I got a king who gave his life for me.

1210
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:25,260
 And let me tell you, the things of earth grow strangely dim

1211
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,020
 in the light of his glory and his grace.

1212
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,820
 How was Jesus able to fight the devil in the desert?

1213
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,920
 Because before Jesus had done a single miracle,

1214
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,800
 the heavens opened, his father looked down and said,

1215
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,840
 "You are my son in whom I'm well pleased."

1216
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,800
 That came first.

1217
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,140
 All the lame people were still lame.

1218
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,580
 All the blind people were still blind.

1219
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,920
 All the water was still water.

1220
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,000
 There was no wine.

1221
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,320
 But he says, "You're my beloved son, and you are pleased."

1222
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,920
 And it was the pleasure of his father

1223
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,860
 that made it easy for him to resist

1224
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,260
 the pressures of the desert.

1225
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,380
 And many of you, your war against temptation,

1226
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,080
 you'll need to get some friends you can confess to.

1227
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,580
 This is where he gets me.

1228
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,680
 This is the pattern.

1229
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,880
 I'm not gonna shame myself.

1230
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,980
 I'm gonna strategically say,

1231
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,400
 "I gotta eliminate this moment."

1232
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,900
 But for many of you, the best thing you can do

1233
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,120
 is say, "No, the best defense is a good offense.

1234
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,440
 "I'm gonna get real good at this

1235
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,340
 "and enjoying the love of my king."

1236
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,620
 How did Romeo get rid of Rosalind?

1237
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,240
 How did Romeo get rid of Rosalind?

1238
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,420
 You don't remember Rosalind.

1239
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,260
 Briefly.

1240
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,540
 Go read Romeo and Juliet.

1241
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:44,380
 At the beginning, Romeo is pining away over Rosalind.

1242
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,740
 "Oh, Rosalind, I love Rosalind, I need Rosalind.

1243
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,920
 "He's going on so much, it annoys his buddy Benvolio."

1244
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,920
 And Benvolio says, "Dude, I'm gonna take you

1245
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,020
 "to a party tonight.

1246
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:56,060
 "There's gonna be like 100 girls there hotter than Rosalind.

1247
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:56,900
 "Go read it."

1248
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,880
 That's a rough translation, like the message version,

1249
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,720
 but it's there.

1250
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,620
 (audience laughing)

1251
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:07,000
 And Romeo says, "The all-seeing sun

1252
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,840
 "has ne'er met her match since first the world begun."

1253
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,080
 Whoa, there's no one hotter than Rosalind.

1254
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:20,440
 Then he goes to the party and he sees Juliet.

1255
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,580
 And that night, he sneaks into her yard and says,

1256
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:29,680
 "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?

1257
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,280
 "It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

1258
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,340
 "Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon

1259
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:39,020
 "which is already sick and pale with grief,

1260
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,480
 "that thou her maid art far more fair than she."

1261
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,180
 Rosalind, who?

1262
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,520
 (audience laughing)

1263
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,720
 And the way you dislodge a beautiful thing

1264
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,940
 is you replace it with a more beautiful thing.

1265
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,960
 That's how Augustine, the greatest Christian thinker,

1266
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,600
 overcame his sexual addiction.

1267
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:01,200
 He says, "How sweet it was to lose the things

1268
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,620
 "I had once so feared to lose.

1269
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:07,420
 "You drove them from me, and you took their place,

1270
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,480
 "you who are the true sovereign joy."

1271
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,040
 Get good at lingering in his presence.

1272
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,760
 Get good at lingering with his people.

1273
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,200
 Orbit people who think about him to stir their heart for him

1274
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,760
 so they can run after him.

1275
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,680
 I'm gonna load my mind with the thoughts of God in my car.

1276
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,760
 I'm gonna let it stir my affections for God on my bed,

1277
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,640
 and I'm gonna run after him in a church,

1278
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,360
 at the porch, in a community,

1279
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,240
 and it's gonna set my heart free.

1280
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,960
 I'm on a different path, not to earn his approval,

1281
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,880
 but because I have it, 'cause I got a father who loves me

1282
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,740
 and a son who fought for me, and I got a life to live

1283
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,140
 chasing after him until I see his face.

1284
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:47,640
 So Father, thank you that you love us.

1285
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,120
 Thank you that you're honest with us

1286
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,880
 about our sin, but you don't come to condemn us.

1287
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,340
 Nobody in this room wants to condemn anybody in this room.

1288
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:01,500
 You are honest with us about sin.

1289
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,880
 It promises life and gives you death,

1290
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,760
 and some of you, you have been chasing temptation,

1291
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,560
 calling it life, but the truth is,

1292
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,920
 it has brought nothing but death into your life,

1293
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,020
 and Jesus Christ came not to condemn you,

1294
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,840
 but to save you, to set you free.

1295
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,540
 Some of you, you need to put your faith in him tonight.

1296
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:24,240
 See, if the stronger one is coming to break chains,

1297
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,080
 break mine.

1298
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,140
 If he's coming to forgive, forgive me.

1299
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:32,200
 If you're transferring people into the kingdom

1300
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,480
 of the beloved son, transfer me.

1301
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,480
 The first thing you need to do is say,

1302
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,900
 Savior, King, Warrior Jesus, fight for me,

1303
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,400
 rescue me, adopt me, I'm yours.

1304
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,680
 And then let's just be honest with him

1305
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,560
 about where we struggle.

1306
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,160
 He knows, but it's so good for us to say,

1307
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,560
 I'm not gonna shame myself.

1308
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,520
 That's the enemy's territory.

1309
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,240
 But let me just think strategically and go,

1310
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,080
 what do I think about?

1311
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:55,920
 That's a lie.

1312
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,360
 What do I entertain in my heart that is leading me

1313
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,000
 places I know I don't need to go?

1314
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 Ask him to give you a vision of a friend

1315
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,760
 you could confess to and say, this is where he gets me.

1316
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,640
 And then I just wanna challenge you, family,

1317
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,680
 before you leave this room, just take a minute and pray

1318
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,080
 and go, God, would you give me a vision

1319
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,200
 of what it would look like for me to be a young woman

1320
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,880
 or a young man who runs with you,

1321
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,940
 who wakes up tomorrow and believes you love me,

1322
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,400
 who wakes up tomorrow and go,

1323
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,100
 I'm gonna set my mind on the King.

1324
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,360
 I'm gonna let my heart be stirred

1325
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,880
 by the things that stir your heart.

1326
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,120
 I wanna run with your people in the path of your laws

1327
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,880
 'cause they set my heart free.

1328
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,760
 Ask him to give you a vision of what that looks like.

1329
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,240
 Maybe it's a you that is hard to imagine,

1330
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,920
 but a you studying the word of God

1331
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,640
 with other women and other men who love him,

1332
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,200
 people helping you walk free, making good decisions,

1333
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,800
 day by day, looking up and saying,

1334
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,480
 I'm in a different place because of the grace of God.

1335
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,880
 Ask him to give you a vision

1336
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:05,280
 of a child in the arms of a father who dearly loves you

1337
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,880
 and wants you to walk with him.

1338
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,180
 Lord, minister to us.

1339
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,200
 Encourage us.

1340
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,320
 We're your children and we're grateful to you.

1341
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,160
 Amen.

1342
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,740
 (gentle music)

1343
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:29,740
