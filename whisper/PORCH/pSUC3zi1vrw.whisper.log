[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:19.540]   - Well, all right, welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.920]   friends in Fort Worth and in Houston and El Paso
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.500]   and Austin and Corsicana, Tulsa, wherever,
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.920]   and this guy back here in the front row.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.500]   Hey, really quick announcement before we jump
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.660]   into what we're gonna do tonight.
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.400]   We wanted to make sure everybody's joining us.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.480]   This is the last kind of corporate gathering
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.080]   we're gonna have in 2018, say it ain't so,
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.080]   but because of that, we wanted to make sure
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.000]   that we gave one more just opportunity for you guys
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.920]   to find out about this thing we're doing called Awaken,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.760]   which is a conference over Memorial Day weekend
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.520]   where thousands of young adults are gonna come together
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.800]   and gather and we hope it is a launching pad
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.160]   for what God is gonna start in our nation,
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.740]   a revival of sorts.
[00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.740]   We believe that this generation is the group
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.680]   that God is gonna use to do something transformative
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.200]   to the society that we live in
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.980]   and we believe that when we lock arms
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.240]   underneath the name of Christ, we can be a part of it
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.600]   and candidly, we wanna see what God is doing here
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.960]   in spite of us really take place all over the country
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.160]   and all over our world for his name
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.640]   and for people to not come to the porch,
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.880]   but people to come to Jesus and come to meet him.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.360]   So because of that, I wanted to have my friend Garrett,
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.520]   who's gonna join us and let you guys know
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.440]   about an opportunity in light of the fact
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.080]   that we believe it's gonna sell out.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.160]   We want everyone who God wants to be there to be there
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.720]   and we know that the people inside of this room
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.120]   are connected to and are some of the people
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.920]   that we wanna partner with and gather with
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.920]   and he wants to let you guys know,
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.440]   we want you guys to know about an opportunity
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.180]   before this year is out and so Garrett, take it from there.
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.120]   - Hey, if you wanna an idea of what the moment of Awaken
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.800]   is gonna be like, you can imagine three days,
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.920]   Memorial Day weekend, 2019, downtown Dallas,
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.600]   really close to some of you here in the room,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.480]   might be a plane flight or a long road trip
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.000]   for some of you that are listening from elsewhere,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.980]   but you can imagine Porch on Steroids, three days,
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.200]   some of the best communicators and leaders that you know
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.460]   and love, JP, Todd, David, the Shanes,
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.400]   and the best lineup we have ever put together
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.320]   that we are not going to announce just yet.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.400]   I'm sorry about that, we're holding you in suspense,
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.600]   but it is gonna be what we believe
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.120]   is gonna be the most definitive moment in Porch history.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.100]   I don't know if you know the narrative of the Porch,
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.640]   but it began over a decade ago with dozens of people
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.040]   and now you look around or you listen in
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.020]   and you pay attention and you can kinda notice
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.960]   what God has done here, which by the way,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.000]   is nothing but an extension of the church
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.840]   Jesus created 2,000 years ago.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.680]   We get to play one little small part
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.640]   and Awakened Conference is us opening our arms wide
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.160]   to get more people together.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.640]   We used to do a three day holiday weekend retreat
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.920]   and we shut that one down because there wasn't enough room,
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.080]   not only for the people elsewhere,
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.200]   but even for right here in Dallas.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.440]   So that's what's gonna happen
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.040]   and you just gotta know one thing,
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.160]   for us it's not just about the moment,
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.360]   it's about the movement.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.260]   It's not just about coming together as a big church
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.760]   for a big meeting, this is about a big cause
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.520]   that a big God is inviting us into his purpose for our lives.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.060]   The greatest cause, the greatest claim
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.760]   that anyone would ever have on our lives
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.080]   is the purpose and the fame of Jesus Christ.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.280]   So I'm sorry, I'm not gonna preach this,
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.240]   it's your turn tonight.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.180]   But so here's what you can do
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.480]   between now and the end of the year,
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.300]   here's what we're gonna do,
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.760]   we've had people ask a little bit about gear,
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.480]   if you want some free gear, here's all you gotta do.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.320]   When you sign up any time between now
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.960]   and the end of the year, as soon as you complete
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.760]   your ticket purchase, you're gonna get a unique link.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.280]   It's gonna be a pop-up and a follow-up email.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.880]   This is not that pop-up you X out of,
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.400]   this is the one you wanna click on.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.760]   You get your link, you share that with friends,
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.420]   and if just one friend signs up through your link,
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.000]   then we are gonna mail you this swag box
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.120]   in the mail, T-shirt, the one David is rocking right here,
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.240]   and some of these other guys are gonna be wearing,
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.960]   we're gonna mail that to you, that's how you get it.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.280]   - Not this one, not this exact one.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.560]   - Not that exact one, yeah.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.520]   You're wearing it well, though.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.360]   - Thank you. - I'm sure some people
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.400]   would want that.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.840]   But anyway, not I.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.240]   So here's the deal.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.600]   Don't make me tell these people you modeled,
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.200]   I felt too late, too late.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.400]   - Hey, we gotta land this plane.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.240]   - So here's the deal, between now and the end of the year,
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.320]   you'll get the link, that's how you do it.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.260]   Couple things, if you've already signed up,
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.720]   don't worry, we emailed you so you can get in on this,
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.760]   so there's an email waiting for you there.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.560]   So Merry Christmas from AwakendConference.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.400]   We'll see you guys in May.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.220]   - I love it.
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.920]   Hey, well tonight we're gonna have a fun chance
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.560]   to talk about how to survive the holidays.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.080]   We're coming fresh off Thanksgiving break.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.560]   We're headed in towards Christmas,
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.460]   and how to avoid some of the pitfalls
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.840]   of just the Christmas break,
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.720]   and make sure that your faith doesn't take a holiday
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.560]   over the holidays.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.380]   And so that's where we're gonna dive in
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.840]   for the next 30, 35 minutes or so.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.640]   And look who it is.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.440]   You guys, give it up for Jonathan McKernan.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.600]   (audience cheering)
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.840]   - How we doing, porch?
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.360]   (audience cheering)
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.400]   Hey, I'm just gonna follow that up and say,
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.160]   listen, you don't wanna miss that.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.960]   I've sat on this stage dozens of times,
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.640]   and I've talked to people, and I've said,
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.720]   hey, you don't wanna miss this,
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.360]   you don't wanna miss this, you don't wanna miss this.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.720]   Then they come crying to me and say,
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.680]   hey, I'm sorry that I didn't listen to you.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.720]   Awaken.live.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.100]   It's gonna be the things that people are talking about
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.400]   for generations to come, all right?
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.400]   Hey, I'm pumped to start these little messages this evening.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.800]   There's gonna be three of 'em,
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.100]   but this first one is sometimes,
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.760]   we have all of these expectations around Christmas,
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.440]   and things don't quite go as planned.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.480]   And so this happened to me last year, all right?
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.800]   I'm a dad, I've got three kids,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.520]   and I was wrestling with what to get them for Christmas.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.180]   And I said I was gonna go big.
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.960]   I saw the Lexus commercials, the Hallmark commercials,
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.280]   and not the Lexus, but the puppy in the commercials.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.760]   And I thought, I'm gonna get them a puppy.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.720]   Now, this was a big deal, because my wife and I,
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.720]   we have argued about this topic of pets for 14 years, okay?
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.720]   Because we just disagree, we view them differently, right?
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.860]   Like, I view them as pets, and she views them as people.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.320]   And so we just, we don't see eye to eye on that.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.640]   But you know what, I said, I'm gonna do it.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.760]   My little girl wants a puppy.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.160]   Well, like, I'm just gonna make it happen.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.520]   And I had this huge plan of the grand reveal
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.480]   being here at Watermark at the Christmas party.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.720]   And we went and we picked out this
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.840]   fluffy little Labradoodle thing,
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.680]   and got the box, and it had the big bow on it
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.000]   and everything, and we kept the puppy in here
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   for just the right moment at the Christmas party
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.200]   with kids out there.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.480]   It was gonna be the grand unveil.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.560]   And I had friends with video cameras and taking pictures,
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.200]   because it was gonna go mega viral on Instagram.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.440]   And so I actually, I'm gonna show you the video, all right?
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.320]   I want you, here's the video.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.200]   (crowd chattering)
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.160]   All right, we got two, all right,
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.920]   hold on, let's pause the game really quick.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.760]   - Presents!
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.720]   - We gotta get the order in.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.280]   You ready? - Yeah.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.880]   - Ready to open it?
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.720]   Okay.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.080]   I didn't stop it right there.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.360]   Here's what happened.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.440]   The person who was filming stopped filming
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.320]   because when they opened the box
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.920]   and they saw what was inside, they completely panicked,
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.840]   as did everyone else.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.840]   Somehow, from moving that puppy from there
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.000]   to the fireplace in that box,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   it managed to get the bow completely wrapped around its neck
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.200]   so tight that when they opened the box,
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.760]   it was strangling the puppy nearly to death, okay?
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.320]   And so we started Christmas with an almost dead puppy,
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.960]   all right?
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.040]   And so there were lots of tears that followed that moment,
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.040]   lots of trauma, I've got two children
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.680]   in counseling because of it, okay?
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.340]   This did not go as planned.
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.080]   And in the same way that that bow,
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.040]   in the same way that that bow nearly choked out that puppy,
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.720]   your expectations around the holidays
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.560]   may choke out Christmas.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.240]   And so I wanna talk about that for just a moment.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.160]   Three things that will bound you up over the holidays.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.240]   And you can think about what these are, right?
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.360]   Some of you expect or hope to be snuggled up
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.880]   with someone near a fire,
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.840]   but you found yourself in a season of loneliness,
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.360]   or some of you are hoping for a particular gift,
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.280]   but all of your friends and your family
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.480]   aren't getting the hints
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.920]   that you're not so subtly dropping.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.180]   Some of you are thinking about running into your ex
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.320]   in Walmart and reminding them how successful you are
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.620]   or that you're a pastor or that you've written a book.
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.460]   No, nevermind.
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.520]   [congregation laughing]
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.560]   You know that your mom and dad this holiday,
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.400]   when you go home,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.480]   you know they're gonna be boozing it up, right?
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.600]   And you're thinking about that already,
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.520]   how you're gonna navigate that,
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.780]   or you know you're gonna run into your old friends
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.200]   and they're gonna get throwed on New Year's.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.360]   And you're already thinking about that.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.260]   Those are where your expectations are going.
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.700]   And so let's talk about three things,
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.040]   three expectations that will have you bound this holiday.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.900]   The first one is busyness.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.720]   Number one, busyness.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.080]   We expect to be busy 'tis the season,
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.520]   to panic and stress and travel
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.600]   and the parties and the Christmas parties,
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.960]   the New Year's parties, the families in town,
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.480]   and you're trying to balance it all
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.960]   or the stress of thinking about being alone,
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.840]   not missing out, wanting to be everywhere at once
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.880]   and staying by yourself is just a traumatic thought.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.700]   And I would say, what if you adjusted your expectations
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.700]   that right now you are going to find some quiet space
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.520]   this holiday, this Christmas,
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.120]   that you actually were gonna plan on it,
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.080]   that when it happens you don't have to panic,
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.660]   but you've planned for it
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.800]   because you believe this could honor God.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.720]   See, busy, I've heard, is an acronym,
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.720]   being under Satan's yoke, being under Satan's yoke.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.720]   Yoke is a strange word.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.520]   Yoke is something that you put around an animal
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.240]   so that you have an ability to control it.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.740]   It's something you bound an animal with.
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.040]   But let me read to you what Jesus says
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.440]   in Matthew 11, verses 28 and 30.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.640]   Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.240]   and I will give you rest, for my yoke is easy
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.300]   and my burden is light.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:24.520]   Another thing that's gonna have you bound this holiday
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.740]   are your old friends.
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.080]   You're gonna go back to some of the same places
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.760]   and the same spaces that you've been to
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.220]   and you're gonna bump into some of the same people.
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.560]   And what I know is true of everyone listening
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.920]   here in Dallas and wherever you're at through the stream
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.120]   is that everyone here has a past.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.960]   And when you go home for the holidays,
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.920]   a lot of times that past is waiting on you.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.280]   And you drive by those familiar places
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.600]   and you know, like, I got in a fight right there
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.600]   and oh, I remember we got high right there
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.480]   and that one time we stole those bottles of wine
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.200]   from that store and then went over there
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.640]   and got drunk, I actually got arrested over there.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.800]   And when you're driving through those familiar places,
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.600]   we made out behind that, right,
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:09.220]   those memories are gonna be flooding back at you, right?
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.520]   You know where the porn stash is.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.380]   You know where the sin is waiting for you.
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:21.960]   And those old friends, they wanna pick right back up
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.240]   where you left off.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.120]   You know those old friends,
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.520]   they're telling the same stories over and over.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.400]   Remember when we, and it's followed by a lot of laughter,
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.080]   you're laughing, you know what you're doing, you're laughing.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.360]   It's all like, oh yeah, I remember, we can't believe.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.000]   And all the while you're laughing
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   at the very things that Christ died for.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.080]   Reliving those stories that have caused scars
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.960]   that you still have today.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:54.480]   And I will just tell you that if you cannot influence
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.800]   those friends for Christ,
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.400]   then they will influence you for Satan.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.480]   I know that feels heavy handed,
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.720]   and I'm gonna say it again.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.360]   If you don't influence them for Christ,
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.160]   they're going to influence you for Satan.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.600]   And so you need to think about what it looks like
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.620]   to be intentional with those friends
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.860]   or to not have any contact with them at all,
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.080]   which may be exactly what you need to do.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.600]   And so what you can expect is expect to tell them
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.900]   how you've changed, that it's no longer you who live,
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.880]   but Christ that lives in you.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.200]   There's a story about St. Augustine
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.800]   that when he had this radical conversion,
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.560]   he lived in the world and Jesus grabbed ahold of his heart.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.560]   And one day when he was walking
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.400]   and he bumped into an old mistress of his.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.680]   And when he saw her, he began to walk quickly
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.800]   the other direction, but she tried to stop him.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.680]   Augustine, Augustine, it is I.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.100]   Augustine, it is I.
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.140]   And he stopped and he turned back to her
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.160]   and he said, yes, madam, but it is no longer I.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.080]   And he kept going.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.480]   And some of you, that's the message
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.520]   that you need to give your friends.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.500]   Hey, I've changed.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.600]   I'm not the same old person.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.480]   I don't delight in those stories anymore.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.400]   I remember them, but they're no longer,
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.920]   that's no longer how I have fun,
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.440]   that's no longer what I do.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.440]   I'm a new creation.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.280]   The third thing that will have you bound this holiday
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.220]   is wine.
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.920]   Wine is what it's called in the Scriptures, alcohol, right?
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.560]   We expect to party this holiday.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.500]   We expect to party at New Year's,
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.080]   but Ephesians 5:18 says, do not get drunk on wine,
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.060]   which leads to debauchery, amen.
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.680]   We all know that.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.880]   It leads to debauchery when you get drunk on wine.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.000]   It leads to, it only leads to one,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.600]   the Scripture doesn't give you a lot of options.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.040]   There's wine, you get drunk, it leads to debauchery.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.300]   That's what it does.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.160]   Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.160]   You also have instruction in Proverbs 20,
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.240]   in chapter 23, in chapter 31.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.680]   Over and over, the Scriptures warn us about this.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.000]   And for so many Christians,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.080]   Christmas and New Year's means party.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.060]   It's almost like the purge or Fat Tuesday.
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.880]   It's like that season where, you know,
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.560]   we know we're not supposed to,
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.740]   but we're just gonna do it anyway.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:15.740]   We're just gonna give our flesh permission to indulge.
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:19.480]   And it's crazy because it's like the thing,
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.080]   when it's the time when Jesus came to the earth
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.760]   and the way that we celebrate the birth of our Savior
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.300]   is by getting wasted.
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.340]   And some of you, you're walking into extreme temptation
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.780]   and you know it.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.120]   And I want you to know because I just want this
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.760]   to be really clear,
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.200]   so that you don't have to wrestle with it.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.940]   For the rest of your life, from this moment forward,
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:44.320]   for the rest of your life, until you are with Jesus,
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.300]   you getting drunk will be a sin.
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.380]   You don't have to wonder.
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.420]   Like you getting drunk, it's a sin.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.340]   Let's just call it what it is.
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.380]   It's a sin.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:59.900]   It grieves the heart of God.
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.340]   And so I'm not a pastor that's like,
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.780]   hey, you can't drink any alcohol, that that's wrong.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.860]   You having a glass of wine, it may not be a sin for you.
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.780]   You having two glasses of wine, it may be a sin for you.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.980]   You having a beer, it may not be a sin for you.
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.420]   If that's not your struggle,
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.940]   you're not tempted to have two or three or four,
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.860]   but you having two or three or four,
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:24.820]   let's call it what it is.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.180]   Let's just look at that and say, oh yeah, that's a sin.
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.980]   I just willfully chose to go the opposite way
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.300]   of what the scripture said.
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.160]   That's what I did.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.580]   Let's call it what it is.
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:41.060]   And it's always going to bring bondage.
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.220]   No good story in your life starts,
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.860]   remember when we got so drunk?
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.640]   Whatever comes next is not gonna,
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.860]   remember when we got so drunk
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.540]   and we experienced that deep intimacy with Jesus?
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.740]   No, it's never gonna be that.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.580]   Remember when we got wasted
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.980]   and we grew so much spiritually?
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:00.820]   No, no, no.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.900]   Remember when we were so wasted
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.580]   that we gave all our money to the orphans?
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.220]   No, that's not the way that that works out.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.740]   Maybe to the bartender, but not the orphans, right?
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.000]   And so this Christmas, expect to stay sober.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.920]   I know that literally some of you
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.420]   have literally been enslaved by this.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:22.120]   Like several of you, dozens of you have been through rehab.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.420]   All while the enemy just delights
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.860]   in the way that we celebrate Christmas.
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.140]   And so things that will entangle you over this holiday
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.860]   is things that will have you tied up.
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.860]   Busyness, old friends, and wine.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.900]   It spells bow, like the very one that strangled my puppy.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.720]   All right.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.160]   Hebrews 12, one and two says this.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.960]   Let us throw off everything that hinders
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.400]   and the sin that so easily entangles
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.400]   and let us run with perseverance
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.120]   the race marked out for us,
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.400]   fixing our eyes on Jesus,
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.400]   the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.640]   Let us throw off everything that entangles us
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.120]   and the sin that hinders us
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.160]   and let us fix our eyes on the one
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.240]   who came to the earth to save us.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.760]   What's interesting about the word bow
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.640]   is it's a homograph.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.660]   It is a word that can be pronounced two different ways
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.640]   with two very different meanings.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.280]   It's also how you spell bow.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:37.800]   And bow is what you want to do this holiday, this Christmas.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.940]   Bow is what you want to do with your life.
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:46.440]   If you want to avoid the sin that so easily entangles you,
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.480]   you maintain a posturing of the very ones
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:55.480]   who first walked up upon the baby in a manger
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:00.000]   that their knees broke, their back bent,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.040]   their face to the ground, and they worshiped him.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.400]   You live a life of worship.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.080]   Do not conform any longer to the patterns of this world,
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.740]   but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.180]   Then you will be able to test and approve
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.980]   what God's will is, his good, pleasing, and perfect will.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.260]   He says, therefore, I urge you in view of God's mercy
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:26.260]   to present your bodies as living sacrifices.
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:30.140]   So you bow before the Savior.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.780]   I know for some of you, you hear that
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.340]   and you feel like it's too late.
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.820]   And you're like, what do I do if it's too late?
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.320]   That's why my friend Daniel Crawford
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.880]   is gonna come up and share with you
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.760]   exactly what you need to do if it's too late.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.860]   And so please welcome Daniel to the stage.
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.280]   [audience applauding]
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.840]   - Lower this down a little bit.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.980]   I remember it clearly.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:58.920]   I was driving home.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.120]   It was a holiday break.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.040]   I was cruising down I-45, going to Houston,
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.840]   and I heard that sound.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.520]   And if you know that sound,
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.240]   I realized, darn it, something has gone wrong
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.160]   with my automobile.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.840]   I must check, I must pull over.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.320]   And I looked, and sure enough, I had blown a tire,
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.480]   and I had a flat tire.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.680]   And so in the grand scheme of malfunctions,
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.360]   not the biggest deal in the world.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.460]   I can overcome this so long as I know
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.480]   how to properly change a tire.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.760]   I don't know how to properly change a tire.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.540]   And so I was by myself.
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.600]   And so frankly, I was kind of out of luck,
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.560]   and I was kind of figuring out what do I do next.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.760]   I was feeling rather deflated, literally and metaphorically.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.480]   And so I start with that for exactly what JP just said,
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.600]   which is, man, I'm just rolling off of Thanksgiving,
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.760]   which kind of kickstarts the holiday season,
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.400]   and I'm not feeling like I'm firing on all cylinders.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.440]   Like if that's any indicator
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.400]   of what I'm gonna be looking at in December,
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.760]   I'm not encouraged.
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.600]   I'm discouraged.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.320]   And so this second little mini message
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.500]   is gonna be about what do I do when I've blown it?
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.880]   What do I do when I've blown it?
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.600]   So I admitted to you freely
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.340]   that I don't necessarily have a man card,
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.720]   at least not in that situation.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.040]   I'm not handy.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.280]   But I do have something that in that situation
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.000]   is of equal value.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.880]   And so that's what I like to call a AAA card.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.280]   Praise God, yes.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.080]   And so I can call AAA when I don't know
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.400]   how to change my own tire,
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.640]   even though I'm a grown man, and they will come,
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.600]   and they will help me.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.800]   And so I wanna give you guys three A's, that's right,
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   your very own AAA plan to call upon when you've blown it
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.400]   and when you're feeling flat.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.040]   And so I'm actually gonna unpack very practically
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.120]   the exact passage that JP just closed with,
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.720]   which is in Hebrews 12.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.360]   And so starting at the top in verse one,
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:01.200]   the first A is going to be accountability, accountability.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.800]   And very simply, I would say, confess to community.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.240]   When you've blown it, keep short accounts
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.360]   and confess to your community.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.640]   That verse started by saying,
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.760]   "Therefore, since we are surrounded
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.200]   "by such a great cloud of witnesses,"
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.520]   that's what it's talking about.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.960]   Who are, it assumes that there is a great cloud of witnesses
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.400]   that there are people surrounding you to love you,
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.400]   to support you, to point you back to the truth
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.800]   that's found in God's words
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.400]   so that ultimately they can point you back to Jesus.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.560]   I would also say that I would encourage you guys
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.480]   to get to a point where you're confessing
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.360]   even at a thought level,
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.000]   even in the moments of temptation
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   where maybe you haven't blown it, I would get on the phone,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.760]   I would loop in your crew, your guys, your girls,
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.720]   "Hey, this is what I'm struggling with.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.840]   "I'm feeling very tempted right now, will you pray for me?"
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.640]   James 5:16 says, "Confess your sins to one another
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.940]   "and pray for one another so that you may be healed."
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.120]   And if you're like me, when I'm feeling in those moments,
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.520]   when I've blown it, I want healing.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.400]   And so that starts with confession,
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.560]   it starts with prayer, it starts with community,
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.640]   it starts with accountability.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.240]   And so that verse continued, verse one,
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.160]   "Surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses,
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.280]   "let us throw off everything that hinders
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.440]   "and the sin that so easily entangles."
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.960]   So JP hit that hard.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.520]   What are the things that we need to avoid,
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.560]   that we need to remove access from?
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.200]   The second A is access.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.120]   "Repent and remove access for whatever those things are
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.820]   "that are hindering you, that are causing you to blow it
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.640]   "and to feel deflated."
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.320]   And so he talked about alcohol.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.320]   I would include drugs in there.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.080]   Yes, I would consider weed a drug.
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.960]   Okay, and so the question comes along,
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.000]   can I not go anywhere where there's alcohol?
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.840]   And I would just say, maybe.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.760]   I would say you would probably know better than me.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.620]   I would say I wouldn't rule it out.
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.000]   And I would also say that personally,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.680]   if I'm like on a diet,
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.120]   like I'm trying to keep my boyish figure here,
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.160]   and I'm throwing some, I'm going keto on you.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.480]   I don't even fully know what that is yet,
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.400]   but I've heard it's a thing.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.680]   If I hypothetically wanted to go keto, which I don't,
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.520]   I'm probably not gonna go hang out at Cain's
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.720]   and watch people eat fried chicken all day
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.560]   'cause it's delicious.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.120]   And I've been there so many times.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.000]   And as soon as I see the sauce, I start salivating.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.160]   I don't wanna talk about it even right now.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:39.880]   And so I would rather just avoid the temptation.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.960]   I would just dodge.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.280]   I would endure the night with a little bit of FOMO
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.160]   instead of the morning with a whole lot of uh-oh,
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.520]   if you know what I'm talking about.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.900]   And there is that strong correlation
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.800]   between when I'm under the influence,
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.760]   I'm gonna do things that I'm gonna regret.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.800]   I'm going to make mistakes.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.680]   And so JP also talked about old friends,
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.180]   and I might just add old flames.
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.520]   You know what I'm talking about, okay?
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.100]   Being mindful, not just of the party atmosphere,
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.820]   but also of the guest list.
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.320]   And I think he said that really well,
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.960]   which is, man, what is that balance
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.680]   between loving my friends and also just being wise?
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.020]   And I would say, I would encourage you
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.080]   to just set the tone with that
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.040]   and to stay in the driver's seat.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.020]   I would literally drive wherever you're going
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.720]   so that you have that ability to control.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.600]   I would also say, I think breakfast and lunch
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.640]   is your friend way more than dinner and drinks.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.320]   And I would say, I think he hit on something that's huge,
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.500]   that is, if the main bond you share with these old friends
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.180]   is stories from the past,
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.800]   and it's a past that you're not particularly proud of
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.000]   and that you've been redeemed out of,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.480]   you can take a walk down memory lane
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.500]   as you connect with people,
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.880]   but I would not stop and I would not celebrate sin.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:02.120]   And I wouldn't relive that over and over again.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.720]   I don't think that's helpful.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.000]   So just a couple of facts.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.720]   I am responsible for every bad decision that I make, period.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.040]   And I seem to make a lot more bad decisions
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.200]   around certain people or certain groups of people.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.560]   And so do without what you will.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.240]   I would just be thoughtful before you commit to things,
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.960]   and I would be willing to say no.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.360]   I'd be willing to say no.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.640]   So there's dozens of other things
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.960]   you could remove access from.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.960]   The one other one that I'll hit quickly is social media.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.240]   And I would just say this,
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.760]   man, maybe you need to remove access entirely,
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.840]   or at least maybe you need to significantly reduce
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.480]   the amount of screen time.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.640]   'Cause you know how it is.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.340]   If I don't have a ton else to do,
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:48.400]   I can very easily get to scrolling, right?
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.240]   For countless periods of time, right?
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.080]   Do I find myself comparing or envying
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.080]   or judging other people's social media accounts?
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.680]   Am I kind of sort of monitoring whether a certain someone
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.600]   may or may not be here,
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.720]   may or may not be going there tonight?
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.560]   I don't know.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.720]   Do you use social media to project things,
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.660]   especially over the holidays,
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.700]   that maybe if you're totally honest with yourself,
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.160]   masks some insecurities and communicates something
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.840]   that you know at best is an exaggeration
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.600]   and at worst is just blatantly untrue?
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.280]   Are you playing the game, the comparison trap?
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.840]   Are you getting caught in it?
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.280]   And ultimately, do my accounts,
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.160]   do they help or do they hinder my thought life?
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.920]   I would ask yourself that question.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.600]   I would ask your community that question.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.120]   And bottom line, as you throw off the sin
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.600]   that entangles you, just ask yourself,
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.360]   what are the things I need to remove access from?
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.880]   So lastly, and most importantly,
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.820]   the third A in our little triple A plan is to abide,
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:55.800]   to pursue and to protect your personal connection
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.120]   with Jesus Christ.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.640]   It says, "Surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses,
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.460]   "throw off the sin that entangles
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.880]   "and then let us run with perseverance.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.380]   "The race marks out for us,
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.600]   "fixing our eyes on Jesus,
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.540]   "the pioneer and the perfecter of our faith."
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.480]   Jesus said it like this.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.840]   He said, "I am the vine, you are the branches,
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.700]   "whoever abides in me and I in him,
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.740]   "he it is who will bear much fruit.
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.680]   "For apart from me, you can do nothing.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.720]   "Apart from me, you're going to blow it."
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.640]   That's what he's saying.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.360]   And so what does abiding look like?
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.800]   You can get to a point where there's just a life
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.560]   of abiding with Christ on an ongoing basis.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.760]   I would say, I would have a plan in place.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.540]   I think structure can be helpful.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.760]   And so a little strategy that I've picked up
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.820]   that I would pass along and commend to you
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.240]   is I would think through three things.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.620]   I would have a time, I would have a place,
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:54.760]   and I would have a plan.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.560]   A time, a place, and a plan.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.240]   A time, any time, really, but what time of the day
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.120]   are you going to have the most control over
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.200]   and the most say over?
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.800]   Most of the time that's gonna be in the mornings.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.200]   And so before I even leave my room,
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.420]   do I wanna set aside and devote some time
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.240]   to connecting with Jesus before I charge
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.000]   into all of the day's festivities or whatever?
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.960]   Okay, so time.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.820]   I would be as specific as you can be,
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.400]   and I would also be realistic.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.480]   And so it's the breaks, and maybe it's 9 a.m.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.560]   instead of 7 a.m., I don't know.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.920]   Be flexible, but have a plan and have a time.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.000]   A place, where is the place where I can minimize
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.160]   distractions and therefore maximize devotion?
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.280]   And so that may not be in your bedroom
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.840]   if Uncle Eddie's riding top bunk right above you, right?
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.580]   You may need to go get some personal space.
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.580]   I would communicate, I would love your family
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.140]   won't communicate on that, but it's like,
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.780]   hey, I'm gonna be at Starbucks for an hour,
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.900]   and then I'm gonna be back, and I'm excited
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:56.560]   to spend the day with you guys digging in and catching up.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.020]   And then finally, a plan.
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.220]   I would figure out now, or at least start to think about,
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.060]   what do you want to read through?
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.780]   What do you want to meditate on?
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.740]   What in God's word do you wanna work through
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:08.980]   over the break?
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.220]   Again, be specific as you can be,
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.520]   and also be realistic.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.600]   For most of us, I think reading a chapter a day
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.220]   is very realistic.
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.040]   So I wouldn't just do Bible roulette
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.420]   and pick a verse and start reading, right?
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.800]   I would say, okay, there's 31 days in December,
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.860]   there's 31 Proverbs, what if I just read the Proverb
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.940]   that corresponded with whatever day that is
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:30.780]   and meditated on that?
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.680]   There's 24 chapters in Luke,
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.860]   there's 24 days leading up to Christmas.
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.820]   What if I walked through a gospel
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:40.060]   leading up to celebrating Christmas?
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.740]   January, we're not gonna be back in here till the 22nd,
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.060]   what if I read, what if I do January and John?
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.700]   21 chapters, days one through 21,
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.740]   and then we hit it hard in here on the 22nd.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.140]   What if I did that?
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.420]   There's no wrong approach, but I would have a time,
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.540]   a place, and a plan.
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.820]   And the last thing I would say on this
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.420]   is this particularly can be hard
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.120]   when we're in the situation we're talking about,
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.720]   which is, man, I just blew it.
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.740]   Like, I am not proud of the decisions
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.700]   that I made last night.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.740]   And frankly, I feel guilt, I feel shame,
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.420]   I don't feel like I can approach the creator
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:19.140]   of the heavens and the earth based on what I've just done.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:22.000]   And I would just say, be free of that.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.980]   I would say that Scripture is very clear
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.100]   that there is a difference
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.260]   between conviction and condemnation.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.540]   Conviction is of the Spirit.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.980]   If you are a believer and you have the Spirit of God,
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.420]   He's gonna convict you, that's a good thing.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.700]   It's not fun, but it's a reminder,
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.820]   man, I can't just go back and indulge my flesh
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.260]   in the same ways I used to.
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:46.380]   So I'm gonna use that conviction to follow the Lord
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.100]   and to repent, as we've been saying.
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.700]   But condemnation, Romans 8, one just lays it out.
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.500]   It says, there is there now for no condemnation
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.500]   for those who are in Christ.
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.300]   If you're in Christ, if you are a believer
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.240]   and a follower of Christ, there is no condemnation.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.140]   So you can pick your head up
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.780]   and you can pursue the one who has pursued you.
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.860]   And so grace to you, abide with Christ.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.220]   Don't let your time off from work
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.460]   become time off from God's word.
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.140]   When you've blown it, pick yourself back up,
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.260]   fix your eyes on Jesus and keep running the race
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.100]   that He's marked out for you.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:25.340]   And so in summary, our AAA plan,
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:29.860]   utilize accountability, remove access
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.860]   from the things that are harming you
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:35.080]   and abide with Christ every day.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:40.260]   On the side of that road, I had to humbly admit
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.880]   that I was in an entirely helpless situation.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:47.420]   I couldn't do anything to fix and to remedy the situation
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.660]   that I found myself in.
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:52.180]   And so when I blew it, I needed to call on somebody else.
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.860]   I needed somebody to come to me
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.660]   and to meet me in the midst of my mess.
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:01.460]   And guys, that is the Christmas story.
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.060]   That is exactly what we celebrate this time of years,
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.980]   the fact that we all have blown it.
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:10.220]   We all are helpless to fix and remedy our own situation.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:15.220]   So God sent His very own Son to the earth.
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.740]   He put on flesh and He dwelt among us
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.780]   and His name is Jesus Christ.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:24.180]   We get to celebrate His coming here in the next month.
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:28.620]   And so may we call upon Him whenever we've blown it
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.860]   in this season and in every season.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.380]   And so to close out the night,
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.720]   y'all help me give a warm welcome to my buddy, David Marvin.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.940]   (congregation applauding)
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.820]   - All right, hey, anyone dating in this room?
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.420]   Show of hands.
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:48.940]   Good, there's three of you.
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.160]   Hopefully you know.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.940]   And let's do another meet and greet
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:56.180]   to give you guys a chance to meet each other.
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:57.140]   Good grief, people.
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.060]   Guys, ask some of these girls out.
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.940]   Hey, when I was dating, 10 years ago,
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:03.920]   I was dating my wife and one of the decisions
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.900]   that the three of you, oh my gosh.
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.880]   For real, this has gotta change.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.060]   That if you are dating, you are gonna have to go through
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.940]   over the holiday season is the evaluation of,
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.060]   hey, is this person someone
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:20.560]   that I would like to introduce to my family?
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.720]   Am I ready to expose them to the dysfunction
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:27.720]   that I have known so well and for so long?
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.720]   And really, it's almost one of those moments,
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.600]   at least for me, I remember 10 years ago
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.480]   was when my wife came and met my family.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.700]   And if your family's anything like mine,
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.740]   where it's kind of like, oh, buckle up.
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:40.280]   It's like, can this relationship
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.480]   endure what they're about to experience here?
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.700]   Let's make sure we've formed strong enough bonds
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.400]   to where we can be in it together.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.840]   And if you're dating, you're gonna experience that
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.040]   to whatever degree you may have dysfunction in your family,
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.080]   which let's be honest, everyone has dysfunction
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:55.920]   inside of their family.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.180]   One of the biggest pitfalls that a lot of us can fall into
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:01.520]   over the holiday breaks is how to not grow discouraged,
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.720]   frustrated by just the dysfunction
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.480]   that you're gonna be around in your family.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.320]   And not just that, but how to be everything
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.500]   that God wants you to be during the time,
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.920]   during the meals that you're gonna share,
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.160]   during just the time that you'll have over Christmas break,
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.160]   or maybe you just had over Thanksgiving with family members
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.880]   and all the dysfunction that they represent.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:22.840]   So I don't know where your story is.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.040]   I don't know if when you go home,
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.880]   there's your stepbrother who never moved out of the house,
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.060]   still playing video games up there,
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.600]   or your stepmom who's like taking smoke breaks outside
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   every 30 minutes, or your grandma who's like,
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.560]   do you wanna get married someday?
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.240]   Are you, do you know any girls?
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.560]   Or your passive aggressive parents who are like,
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.320]   so are you thinking about getting a real job soon?
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.200]   Or just anything and everything in between,
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.720]   or maybe you've got like the, I feel like there's always,
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:53.840]   one of these in every family,
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.720]   there's the super politically passionate sibling
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.040]   that's either like, build the wall,
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.720]   or like, tear all the walls down,
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:05.700]   and there's just all the craziness that comes with them.
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.840]   Or, this is actually true, or you have like an aunt,
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.440]   this is just me getting stuff off my chest,
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:15.440]   who is like, they make art out of recyclables,
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:22.040]   and they make their own Christmas gifts
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.320]   to give out to people, you're like,
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.080]   I know what I'm getting this year for Christmas.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.760]   I don't know what your family dysfunction is
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.840]   all across the board, or just sibling rivalry
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.880]   and conflict that you have, where you get back there,
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.240]   and they bring up that one time you cut off their hair,
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.280]   or part of it in sixth grade, and you snap back into like,
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.800]   I'm the 16 year old middle child,
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.920]   and you always do this kind of thing,
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:46.800]   and just the dysfunction that can be a part of our family.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.240]   Often what usually happens is that same dysfunction,
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.920]   and even more serious levels of dysfunction
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.000]   cause us to keep our distance,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.320]   or wanna keep our distance from family.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.720]   And yet, when you look at the story of the Bible,
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.080]   and you look at the call on us as Christians,
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.320]   the command that God gives us is that
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.220]   that is not to be the case.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.240]   So what I wanna talk about is look at the story,
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.660]   really, of the initial words of the book of Matthew,
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.440]   where Matthew lays out Jesus's introduction
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.480]   to his Jewish audience.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:19.000]   And he begins to talk about Jesus's dysfunctional family.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.600]   Because inside of that, we're gonna learn just
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.600]   a couple truths about how you and I
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:28.000]   can learn about the way that Jesus
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.780]   not just had a dysfunctional family,
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:34.280]   but responded and moved towards that dysfunction
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.760]   that was represented inside of his family.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.640]   So in Matthew chapter one, it'll be up on the screens,
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.240]   this will be really the last thing we'll talk about tonight,
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.280]   but here's what you need to know.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.600]   In Matthew chapter one, Matthew writes this book,
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.000]   Matthew, to a Jewish audience.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.880]   And he begins to write out why Jesus is the Messiah.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.520]   That's what the book of Matthew, Jewish audience,
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.680]   and he writes out, and he begins to write the lineage,
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.120]   which was very important at that time,
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:58.040]   really, to the Jewish people, but in general, at that time.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.920]   Here's what normally, when people wrote a lineage,
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.800]   they would do.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.960]   They would include kind of the best of the best,
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.840]   the who's who, and here he was related to Caesar,
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.560]   and all the different famous people
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.680]   that were part of their family.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.480]   And they would often, if you study history,
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.120]   they would omit some of the, and that guy never existed,
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.800]   and they would skip different people.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.560]   And they almost every single time, without exception,
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.880]   just 'cause it was a different day and age,
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.180]   they didn't include women.
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:24.920]   It was almost strictly men, 'cause the family line
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.080]   and family name kind of just passed through.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.360]   But Matthew does something very, very different
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.280]   when you read his lineage, that he says,
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.380]   hey, this is the lineage of Jesus.
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.080]   This is the family that Jesus came from.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:41.000]   And he not only includes people that you would think,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.120]   why would you include this person inside of you?
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.720]   He goes out of his way to include some of the worst
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.980]   members of Jesus' lineage.
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.540]   He goes out of his way to include women inside of the story,
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.680]   which was really unheard of in that day,
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.600]   and not just any women.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.760]   Out of these four women, three of them weren't even Jewish.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.520]   And two of them had stories that you just like,
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.620]   hey, if you're gonna mention anybody,
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.080]   you don't mention her.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:09.200]   And Matthew goes out of his way to show that Jesus
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.720]   and the dysfunction that his family's from.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.280]   So let me read just from these verses in Matthew chapter one
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.640]   and we'll see what I'm talking about, which is this.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:19.640]   This is the genealogy of Jesus, the Messiah,
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.880]   the son of David, the son of Abraham.
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.720]   Abraham was the father of Isaac.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.960]   Isaac was the father of Jacob,
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.860]   but Jacob, the father of Judah and his brothers.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:33.400]   Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah,
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.720]   whose mother was Tamar.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.260]   Okay, so everyone that's reading this,
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.040]   if you're Matthew's audience at that time,
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.160]   you just read about the story of Judah and Tamar.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.600]   You probably haven't read the story
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.240]   of Judah and Tamar recently,
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.480]   but it's a story that honestly would be
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.280]   like an explicit message if we devoted it to it,
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.420]   a sermon on a Tuesday night at the porch.
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:54.600]   Judah ended up sleeping with, accidentally,
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.520]   his daughter-in-law, Tamar.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.420]   And they have two twin little baby boys, Perez and Zerah.
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.840]   And if you're like, oh man,
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.200]   that could have been an innocent mistake,
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.400]   here's why he accidentally slept with her,
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.500]   because she was posing as a prostitute.
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.960]   So it's not exactly the most exonerating defense.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.280]   Ah, she was acting like a prostitute, that makes sense.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.920]   That's the person that God says is going to be
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:16.880]   one of the great, great, great, great,
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.400]   great, great grandparents of Jesus.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.920]   Why would you go out of your way,
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.960]   even if this person's in the ancestry, to include them?
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.380]   He didn't have to.
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.920]   And he includes this woman with a story,
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.800]   because as we're about to see,
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.440]   that's the point of the story Matthew's about to write.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.040]   He continues, and he goes on from there,
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.120]   where he says that Perez was the father of Hezron.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.160]   Hezron, the father of Ram.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.000]   What a great name is Ram.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.200]   Ram was the father of Aminadab, Aminadabab.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:48.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:51.440]   Dab, the father of Nashon.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.880]   Nashon was the father of Salmon.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.240]   Salmon was the father of Boaz, whose mother,
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.920]   look at this, was Rahab.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.880]   If you were raised in church, you know who Rahab was,
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.600]   because Rahab had a nickname that came
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.100]   at the end of her name, Rahab the prostitute.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   That he doesn't just include another woman in the story,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.560]   he includes a woman who had an occupation
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:15.880]   that isn't the most glorious occupation that you could have.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.300]   And Matthew goes out of his way.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.160]   If you're gonna include it, why would you include this?
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.280]   Like I could make a case, you could see a case where like,
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.840]   hey, you're writing lineage, and Mother Teresa's in there,
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.400]   and she's, oh, of course, go out of your way
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.920]   to include that, or Susan B. Anthony.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.940]   Just wanna make sure you know that's part of the family.
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.140]   The prostitute?
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:33.520]   Yeah, hey, this is great-great-grandma.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.960]   She sells sex for money.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.480]   And so here she, I mean, think about that with you
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.560]   and your grandma, would you be quick to introduce that
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.100]   to your boyfriend or girlfriend?
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.560]   Oh yeah, this is my grandma, she was a prostitute for a while
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:48.960]   and that's exactly what he's doing.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.880]   What are you doing, Matthew?
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:55.120]   And it doesn't get any better from there, listen to this.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:59.140]   And Jesse, verse six, was the father of King David.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.160]   David was the father of Solomon,
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:05.360]   whose mother had been Uriah's wife.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:11.580]   Uriah's wife was Bathsheba.
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:15.300]   He doesn't even mention Bathsheba.
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:19.060]   He says it in a different way, almost to make sure you know
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.060]   the story of David and Bathsheba, and you may not remember
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.600]   it, but the story of David and Bathsheba was,
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.260]   David was married to several other different women.
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.480]   One day, he's out on his palace, he sees this beautiful
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:32.240]   woman taking a bath on the roof of her house,
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.820]   not a great idea, ladies, but the story goes on from there,
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.500]   and he says, get that woman, bring her to me.
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.420]   They say, that's Uriah, one of your best friend's wife.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.020]   He takes her, he sleeps with her, and she gets pregnant,
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.420]   and in order to cover it up, he has Uriah killed.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:49.700]   And this was the story, or this was one of the men
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:57.120]   that, and women, that when Matthew's writing the story
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.860]   and the lineage of Jesus, he goes out of his way to say,
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.380]   Uriah's wife.
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.280]   When you look inside of the ancestry of the Messiah
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:08.700]   who's here, you see a very different story than maybe
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:09.680]   the one you would have imagined.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.460]   You see that Jesus came from broken people.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:15.180]   The story that Jesus did not just come for sinners,
[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:20.180]   he came from sinners, and Matthew goes out of his way.
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:25.500]   Think about even that language, and Solomon,
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.260]   David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:31.900]   Uriah's wife, oh yeah, whose mom was the wife of another man
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:35.700]   'til David killed him, and that's the little boy
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:38.140]   that God says, hey, I'm gonna continue the line through you.
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:40.780]   Solomon, he's making a very clear point.
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:46.800]   He starts there because these people are the point
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.620]   of the story Matthew's gonna write about
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:53.620]   for the next 28 chapters, that Jesus came from sinners
[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:58.940]   and for sinners, like you, like me, like Rahab,
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:01.980]   and like every dysfunctional person in Jesus's family
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:03.140]   and in your family.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:07.740]   If you come from a dysfunctional home, which we all do,
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:11.020]   take heart because so did Jesus, but also know
[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:14.200]   that you're gonna have a chance to love on those
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.500]   dysfunctional people because the story of Christmas,
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:20.140]   the story of Jesus, is that dysfunction doesn't have
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.940]   to mean distance because of Christmas.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:26.420]   Just like Jesus looked at the dysfunction of our world,
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.740]   of you and of me, and he didn't say I'm gonna keep
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:32.140]   my distance because of that, he moved towards those people
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.940]   so you and I will have a chance to demonstrate
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.780]   that same type of moving towards dysfunctional people
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.860]   and loving them that Jesus did, to demonstrate
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.140]   what we celebrate at Christmas.
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.540]   And one of the greatest opportunities you're gonna have
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:46.680]   is gonna be to love your family.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.320]   Jesus loves your family.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.980]   He loves your family way more than you ever will,
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:55.680]   and he has put you there to be a part of expressing
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.520]   and showing that love.
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:57.660]   And let me just say this really quickly,
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:58.700]   and then I'm gonna close, 'cause I'm gonna give you
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.560]   three things that I think as it relates to family
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.460]   that you could do.
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:06.460]   The first one is to see yourself as just having
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.880]   a change in perspective about your time there,
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.360]   a change in perspective, and here it is.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.300]   You were on a mission trip.
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.440]   You were going on a mission trip.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.820]   If you're going to spend any time with your family
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:17.220]   over the holidays, you are officially on a mission trip.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.300]   And so you have a chance to show the love of Jesus,
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.060]   maybe share your faith, but you were going on a mission
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:23.380]   trip, just like any mission trip if you've ever been on one,
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.300]   only you don't have to travel to Haiti,
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.700]   and you're gonna go to stay indoors most likely,
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:31.860]   and speak English to people, and it's a mission trip
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.300]   to people who are trying to give you presents.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.100]   It's the greatest mission trip ever.
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:36.580]   (congregation laughing)
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.100]   But be assured, it is a mission trip,
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.820]   and you need to change the perspective about the time
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.700]   that you're gonna have there, if you're a Christian.
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:47.280]   The second thing is to love the family members
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.980]   that are in your family where they are,
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:50.900]   exactly where they are.
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.900]   Like don't seek to change them, don't seek to come in,
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:54.600]   'cause this is really just a big deal.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.260]   People will leave environments like this,
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:00.140]   and they'll go home, and they will weaponize their faith,
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.140]   and they will beat people over the head,
[00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:04.340]   and tell them how they're sinning, and they're living wrong,
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:07.460]   and how they need to stop, and God's angry about that.
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:10.340]   Love your family members exactly where they're at.
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:13.160]   If you're gonna err, you can err on the side of grace,
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.200]   but seek not to change your family,
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.300]   which you couldn't do anyways, but to love them
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.380]   where they're at, take an interest in them.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.660]   Ask them questions.
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:24.460]   Maybe they have a different sexual orientation
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.520]   than the Bible instructs, love them.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:31.420]   Stand outside with them when they're taking their smoke break.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.860]   Be an example, love the family,
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.860]   and move towards the dysfunction, embrace the dysfunction.
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:38.380]   That's what Jesus did.
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:39.580]   He wasn't like, hey, get your act together,
[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:40.460]   and then I'll come.
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:43.060]   Embrace the dysfunction, and in doing so,
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:46.700]   you demonstrate what all of us at Christmas are celebrating.
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.180]   The God who moves towards those who are dysfunctional,
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.040]   like me, and like you, and finally,
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.340]   that you would seek a chance to share the gospel.
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:58.340]   One of the easiest ways that you can do this
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.940]   is to share how God is at work inside of your life.
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:04.260]   Share how God has been at work,
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.300]   and the way that he's growing you.
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.000]   It's not offensive.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.260]   Seek to move the conversation in a direction that's there.
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.700]   Maybe they are Christians already,
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:15.580]   they're just not experiencing everything God wants.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:16.740]   Invite them to awaken.
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:19.060]   And say, hey, I'd love for you to come with me.
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.100]   We can be a part of it together,
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.680]   and they can see, catch a glimpse,
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.060]   maybe of what some of you have seen together.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.220]   But in conclusion, change your perspective.
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:27.840]   Love your family as they are.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:28.940]   Seek to share the gospel.
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:32.060]   Christmas is a celebration of the first mission trip.
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.400]   That's what it is.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.140]   Where God of the universe decided,
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.680]   I will lay aside all of my comfort,
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.260]   the eternal heavenly realm,
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:45.860]   and I will set those things aside,
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:48.820]   and I will move towards the dysfunctional human race.
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:51.460]   The first mission trip was initiated.
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.060]   And he came down and was born in a manger
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:57.300]   to die on a tree for dysfunctional people
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.640]   like you and like me.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:02.440]   And he's invited us now to be a part
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.700]   of living on mission and going on mission to our family.
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:09.420]   Those who know him and those who don't
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:10.700]   that we'll spend time with.
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:11.860]   Let me pray.
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:13.460]   Father, I pray for just the opportunities
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:15.880]   that we're gonna have to share our faith.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.660]   Would you, Lord, stretch out your hand
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.700]   and save family members like the ones in my family
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:22.660]   who don't know you?
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:26.780]   And would you open their eyes to the truth?
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:29.780]   Would you use the conversations that I'm gonna get to have
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:30.620]   to be a part of that?
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.360]   I pray for friends in the room who have family members,
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.980]   siblings who have fathers, mothers,
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.460]   step-parents that don't know you.
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:39.580]   Would you stretch out your hand and save them, God?
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.540]   Would you help us to have our first reaction be love?
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:47.360]   Would we love people just where they are, care for them,
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:50.660]   get to know 'em, earn the right to speak
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.760]   in greater ways into their life?
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:56.180]   Thank you for just the men and women
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.620]   who you've placed in different families
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:00.860]   all over this country and other countries
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:02.020]   that are just sitting right in front of me
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:05.420]   and listening wherever they are gathered right now.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:06.940]   You've grabbed many of our hearts.
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.500]   Would you use us to be a part of loving our family?
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:10.780]   Would we not waste our break
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:13.260]   and take a holiday from our faith over the holidays?
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:14.900]   We worship you now in song, amen.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:19.740]   - Where David Ended reminds me of a story
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:21.460]   that Philip Yancey tells.
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:24.540]   Philip Yancey is a writer, was a journalist,
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:28.340]   and he talks about having a fish aquarium.
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:35.060]   And all of the work that goes into making this biosphere,
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:41.300]   this place of life for these fish perfect,
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.020]   that he would clean the tank and filter the water
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:45.940]   and put this aerator in there,
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.020]   and then he'd put these pebbles down
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:52.100]   and these little statues and places for the fish to live,
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.940]   and he would do everything within his power,
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:57.080]   invest so much of his money and his time and his resources
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:01.860]   in making this place the perfect place for the fish to live.
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:05.660]   And then he remembers his disappointment.
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:08.660]   He recalls his disappointment upon his first time
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:13.020]   walking up to the tank and the fish swimming off
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:17.660]   and hiding behind the statues
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:20.420]   and the little things that he put in there.
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:21.700]   They were afraid of him.
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:26.660]   And all he wanted was a pet, like he wanted a relationship.
[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:32.620]   And he realized to connect with the fish,
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:36.680]   he would have to become one.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:41.100]   And this is what happens at Christmas.
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:45.500]   The Creator God makes this place,
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.620]   and he fine-tunes it perfect so that you can live
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.180]   and thrive and have life.
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:53.900]   Made you to be in a relationship with him,
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:58.640]   and you've spent your life running away.
[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:05.060]   And he says to rightfully have a relationship with them
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.840]   so that they know that they can trust me,
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:11.260]   I'd have to become a fish.
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:14.460]   I'd have to become a human.
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:17.940]   I'd have to enter into their world,
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:22.780]   become like one of them.
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.080]   And this is what happens at Christmas.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:28.700]   It's the greatest mission trip that ever happened.
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:32.280]   God leaving his place of perfection,
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:37.780]   putting on humanity, coming to the earth.
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:40.740]   And you know what else he does?
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.500]   Sometimes because he loves you,
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:45.940]   he removes those things you're hiding behind.
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:48.780]   He takes them out.
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:51.140]   He pulls them away.
[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:53.000]   He's doing some of that for you tonight.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.060]   If we can help you, if we can come alongside you,
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:00.220]   if you want to begin a relationship with Jesus Christ,
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:03.580]   the one who came here 2018 years ago,
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:04.420]   we'd love to talk to you.
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:08.400]   There'll be a bunch of people up here in some port shirts.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:12.060]   They'd love to pray with you, hear your story,
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:14.380]   and talk more, and you just come right up here.
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:16.460]   We also have open community group tonight,
[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:19.300]   and so if you know that you don't have relationships
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:22.380]   with other Christians, guys, you walk down this hallway,
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:23.820]   and girls, you walk down this hallway,
[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:24.940]   and right outside those hallways,
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:26.800]   there's rooms full of other people
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.620]   that are just looking to hear more
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:30.860]   about this idea of community.
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:32.460]   I'd encourage you to do that next.
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:36.940]   Just go right in there, and they would love to chat with you.
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.300]   And then lastly, I'll just end how we started.
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.380]   Please, every one of you, I'm talking to you.
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.460]   If you're like, I wonder if he's talking to me,
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:44.380]   I'm talking to you.
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:48.380]   Would you check out awaken.live?
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.820]   We're not trying to sell tickets.
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:53.660]   We're trying to change the world for the cause of Jesus.
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:55.340]   We think he's letting us.
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:56.180]   How about that?
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.160]   We think he's allowing us to,
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.560]   and we want you to be a part of it.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:01.960]   Just go to awaken.live.
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.840]   You can see more information there,
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.440]   but it's gonna be the thing
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.480]   that I don't want you to miss out on.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.740]   Okay?
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:11.620]   I love you guys.
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:13.000]   Go in peace, to love, and serve the Lord.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.160]   Have a Merry Christmas.
