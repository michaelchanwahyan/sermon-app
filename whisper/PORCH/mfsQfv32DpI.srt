1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,160
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,740
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,960
 - All right, what's up everybody in the room?

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,920

 the home of the Dallas Mavericks,

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,640
 about to launch the greatest comeback in NBA history.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,840
 (audience cheering)

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,920
 Happening man, Luka's going off 42,

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,280
 you'll see it after tonight.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,720
 Okay, hey, we're continuing the series,

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,320
 Point of View, if you were just joining us,

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,800
 we are in a series where we are looking

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,620
 at the point of view of people who interacted

19
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,080
 with the son of God when he was on the planet,

20
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,240
 and tonight we're going to continue,

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,560
 and let me ask a question to set up

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,680
 where we're going to be going tonight.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,040
 What is the best movie soundtrack of all time?

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,920
 (audience shouting)

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,720
 Parent, parent, parent trap?

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,960
 It is definitely not the parent trap, that is for sure.

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,380
 Tarzan, what else?

28
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,540
 (audience shouting)

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,980
 What?

30
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,300
 La La Land?

31
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:42,260
 All right, Lion King,

32
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,600
 I don't know which one it is for you.

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,300
 It is definitely not the parent trap though,

34
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,660
 I'm going to reiterate that.

35
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,820
 I think arguably, at least in the top five,

36
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,460
 you've got to put Lion King in there,

37
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,660
 probably Tarzan, maybe you overwound it.

38
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,620
 My kids recently, I've got a six year old,

39
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,040
 about to be a four year old, and a four month old,

40
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,820
 and with our older two, of course,

41
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,460
 Disney is just, you just live and breathe it.

42
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,420
 And so we go back and we watch the Disney movies

43
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,620
 that I grew up on as a kid,

44
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,740
 and one of those being Lion King,

45
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,980
 and recently we watched Lion King,

46
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,940
 and I don't remember, I don't know if you've seen it,

47
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,940
 or remember the plot, I'm about to spoil it,

48
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,540
 but you're 25 years late, so I don't care.

49
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,660
 Anyways, in the plot, you know, Simba,

50
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,960
 he's born, he's got Mufasa,

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,120
 and eventually that evil Uncle Scar sets this thing up,

52
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,320
 Simba ends up being a part of seeing his dad die,

53
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,920
 and he runs off to live with Timon and Pumbaa,

54
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,720
 and eat bugs, eventually the monkey shows up,

55
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,400
 and he sees his dad in the sky,

56
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,620
 and he goes back, defeats Scar, wins the setup.

57
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,060
 Now my kids are seeing this,

58
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,680
 and recently watched it for the first time,

59
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,320
 and of course, they're going to latch onto the music,

60
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,600
 and so whenever we drive around,

61
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,800
 they want to listen to Disney soundtracks of music,

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,280
 so it's Tarzan, Lion King,

63
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,680
 and recently they were singing,

64
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,200
 and they had just watched the movie,

65
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,520
 and they were singing in the car this past Wednesday,

66
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,000
 we're just jamming out, and they're singing,

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,880
 I Just Can't Wait to be King, as you do,

68
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,960
 and eventually my six year old,

69
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,000
 and my four year old are sitting there,

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,360
 and we're singing it and driving in the car,

71
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,640
 and my six year old goes,

72
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,640
 wait, why does he want to be king when he's younger,

73
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,320
 but when he gets older, he doesn't want to be king anymore?

74
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,780
 And we just entered into this serious conversation,

75
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,160
 and before I get to answer it,

76
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,440
 my four year old, and she's three months to be four,

77
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,960
 and she is at that stage where she can't pronounce her R's,

78
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,680
 and yet she thinks she knows everything in the world,

79
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,520
 so she's like to her brother, Crew,

80
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,400
 Crew, Crew, he doesn't want to be king,

81
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,000
 'cause he wants to be with Timon and Pumbaa,

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,680
 and it's like, no, that's not it,

83
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,640
 yeah, he wants to be with Timon and Pumbaa eating the bugs,

84
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,720
 and it's like, no, that's not why he doesn't want to be king,

85
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,220
 and I'm trying to figure out how to articulate

86
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,800
 that Simba carries this shame

87
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,560
 that he blames himself for for his dad,

88
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,720
 and that leads him to run away

89
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,600
 and try to run from his problems,

90
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,560
 and we're in this conversation,

91
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,760
 and what's ironic or interesting about it

92
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,120
 is in so many ways,

93
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,800
 that encounter with someone experiencing shame,

94
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,800
 regret, remorse, blame,

95
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,400
 and it leading to them running

96
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,260
 or seeking to escape from the problems in their past

97
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,560
 or the problems that they have is,

98
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,500
 it's a common human experience.

99
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,720
 In other words, this is a lesson they're learning

100
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,580
 at six and four, but they're gonna be exposed

101
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,280
 to people that do this for the rest of their life

102
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,620
 that may even be something they do in their life,

103
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,540
 and what does that have to do

104
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,180
 with what we're gonna talk about tonight?

105
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,880
 We're gonna look at a story

106
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,240
 that involves someone who is covered in shame

107
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,480
 and see how Jesus deals with it,

108
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,920
 brings healing to it,

109
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,720
 and my hope, 'cause I think about that story,

110
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,120
 and candidly, I think inside of this room,

111
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,520
 that some of you guys, you carry shame and regret

112
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,440
 and remorse over things

113
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,340
 that you've been carrying for decades,

114
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,800
 and as I was preparing this message

115
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,640
 and just thinking through the text

116
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,480
 that we're gonna look at,

117
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,440
 my hope and prayer is that some of us would leave

118
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,360
 and just the weight of shame

119
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,600
 that we're carrying would be lifted.

120
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,240
 Maybe it's shame from not even something you chose to do

121
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,180
 was done to you, a form of abuse.

122
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,340
 Maybe it's shame in your relationship with God,

123
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,440
 and if you were honest, you feel like every time

124
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,840
 you go to pray, you're just flooded

125
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,960
 with all of the different sin in your past

126
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,720
 or maybe your present.

127
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,440
 Maybe it's shame from an eating disorder

128
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,200
 that no one knows,

129
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,840
 and everything looks normal on the outside,

130
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,400
 but you know, and when you're all alone

131
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,880
 and you're staring at the ceiling,

132
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,380
 it just, it haunts you.

133
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,800
 Maybe it's a decision in your past

134
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,840
 from some sexual experience

135
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,240
 that you never thought that would be a part of your story,

136
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,720
 but it is, and it is something you carry with you every day,

137
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,040
 and what you're gonna discover and I'm gonna discover

138
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,300
 is that Jesus wants to meet us in that

139
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,840
 and help us experience freedom from that,

140
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,360
 and so we're gonna look briefly at a story

141
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,160
 in John chapter 21, and it involves Jesus being seen

142
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,280
 through the point of view of the most famous

143
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,560
 of all the disciples, Peter,

144
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,960
 and it's in a moment where Peter is carrying tremendous shame

145
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,960
 from arguably the worst failure in the New Testament,

146
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,320
 where he had abandoned and denied this guy

147
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,680
 that he'd followed for years and that he promised

148
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,200
 that he would never abandon.

149
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,880
 He would go to his death for, go to prison for,

150
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,200
 and yet he didn't, and he's now carrying this shame,

151
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,020
 and Jesus has died and resurrected,

152
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,560
 and he's even appeared to the disciples.

153
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,100
 That happened in John 20.

154
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,000
 We don't have time to go into it,

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,960
 but he's ascended, he's back alive,

156
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,640
 and he shows up to the guys,

157
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,000
 and then Jesus goes off again,

158
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,440
 and Peter and the disciples are wondering,

159
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,600
 like, is God done with us?

160
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,080
 All of us abandoned him in our worst hour of need,

161
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,160
 and so we're gonna look at four brief takeaways

162
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,840
 from this story, and then we're gonna walk through,

163
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,280
 and I believe God wants to set some people free tonight

164
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,200
 and lead a life where you're not gonna carry,

165
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,720
 you can clap for that, you're not gonna carry

166
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,300
 for the rest of your life what he carried.

167
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,920
 All right, this is just getting weird now, okay?

168
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,520
 (audience laughing)

169
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,400
 So let me, let me,

170
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,940
 oh, y'all are out of control, man.

171
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,600
 All right, John chapter 21, but before I go there,

172
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,640
 I'm gonna read John chapter 20, because, thank you,

173
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,080
 John chapter 20, because it's a really interesting take.

174
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,360
 The way that chapter 20 ends, it's as though the book

175
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,720
 is over, and yet John introduces

176
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,400
 an entire new chapter afterwards.

177
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,300
 In other words, let me read this.

178
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,000
 This is the end of John chapter 20,

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,080
 where it says this in verse 30.

180
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,520
 At the very end, you would think the book is over.

181
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,240
 Now, Jesus did many other signs in his presence,

182
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,600
 or in the presence of the disciples,

183
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,120
 which are not written in this book,

184
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,480
 but these, everything I just talked about,

185
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,080
 the last 20 chapters, are written so that you may believe

186
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,760
 Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,

187
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,760
 and that by believing, you may have life in his name.

188
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,360
 Now, that is a great ending, and it's as though John

189
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,920
 is like, oh, man, through the Spirit of God,

190
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,840
 inspired, oh, there's one more story I need to write,

191
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,540
 because there's some unfinished business related to Jesus

192
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,280
 and the leader of the disciples, who is Peter,

193
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,400
 and he launches into this interaction

194
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,460
 that would forever change the church in general

195
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,120
 and Peter and his ministry in life,

196
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,440
 and John knows this, and he launches into that story.

197
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,800
 He says this in verse one.

198
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,000
 After this, this being the resurrection,

199
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,960
 Jesus appearing, Thomas, you know, stick your hands,

200
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,960
 see my scars, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples

201
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,120
 by the Sea of Tiberias, which is another name

202
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,640
 for the Sea of Galilee, and he revealed himself in this way.

203
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,000
 Now, Simon Peter, Thomas, called the twin,

204
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,260
 Nathaniel of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee,

205
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,660
 that's James and John, and two other disciples were together.

206
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,640
 So, there's seven total out of the 11,

207
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,560
 'cause there's not 12 disciples, now there's 11,

208
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,620
 'cause Judas is out, and he drops James and John

209
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,200
 and Nathaniel and Peter and Thomas,

210
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,900
 and then perhaps the greatest,

211
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,240
 like, you know that moment where somebody has a picture

212
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,160
 and they tag everybody in the friend group except for you

213
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,560
 and you're on social media and you're like,

214
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,780
 what the heck, man?

215
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,300
 This is probably the greatest example of that of all time,

216
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,780
 because it's eternal, and that he says,

217
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,880
 there was James and John,

218
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,240
 then there were these two other guys

219
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,780
 that don't even get mentioned,

220
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,740
 and Simon Peter said to them, I'm going fishing.

221
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,140
 And they said to him, we'll go with you.

222
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,120
 They went out and they got into the boat,

223
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,840
 but that night they caught nothing.

224
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,160
 Just as the day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore,

225
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,880
 yet the disciples didn't know it was Jesus.

226
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,740
 And he called out to them, children, do you have any fish?

227
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,960
 And they answered him, no.

228
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,680
 He said, cast your net on the right side of the boat

229
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,780
 and you'll find some.

230
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,120
 And so they cast it,

231
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,240
 and they were not able to bring in the net

232
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,000
 because of the quantity of fish.

233
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,840
 That disciple whom Jesus loved,

234
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,260
 which is how John describes himself

235
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,260
 over and over in his book, you gotta love it,

236
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,400
 therefore said to Peter, it is the Lord.

237
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,440
 Now when Simon Peter heard it was the Lord,

238
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,240
 he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped for work,

239
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,440
 and he threw himself into the sea

240
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,880
 to begin to swim towards the sea.

241
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,400
 The other disciples came in the boat,

242
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,680
 dragging the net full of fish,

243
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,680
 for they were not far off from land, about 100 yards off.

244
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,360
 The first thing I wanna highlight

245
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,340
 is how Jesus runs towards us in our shame.

246
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,640
 Jesus runs towards us in our shame.

247
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,400
 So what just happened, the disciples are there

248
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,100
 and Peter says, I'm going fishing.

249
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,920
 Now Jesus had said, I'm gonna meet you on a mountain

250
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,880
 near Galilee, and Peter's not at the mountain,

251
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,520
 and he's certainly not where he's supposed to be

252
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,420
 because he's carrying all this shame

253
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,320
 from a decision that he had made.

254
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,720
 This is about three weeks after Jesus was crucified,

255
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,800
 and on the night before Jesus was crucified,

256
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,240
 he had his boys together

257
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,600
 and he had what we call the last supper.

258
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,000
 At the last supper, he sits down, they have this meal,

259
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,240
 and during the conversation,

260
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,860
 Jesus says, every one of you will abandon me.

261
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,360
 It's been written that God will strike the shepherd

262
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,440
 and the sheep will scatter.

263
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,680
 Jesus says, you're all gonna abandon.

264
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,780
 And Peter stands up and he says,

265
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,240
 in several different accounts, in Luke 22, he said,

266
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,360
 Lord, I'm ready to go, Luke 22, verse 33 and 34,

267
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,960
 I'm ready to go to prison, even death with you.

268
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,960
 In another version or in Mark's point of view,

269
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,040
 he says, even if all of these guys abandon you,

270
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
 I never will.

271
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,000
 And Jesus says, I tell you, Peter,

272
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,720
 the rooster will not crow this day until you deny me.

273
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,900
 You deny three times that you even know me.

274
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,960
 And Peter goes, there's no way.

275
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,800
 They finish the meal, they go out to pray in this garden,

276
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,640
 all of a sudden, Judas shows up with this temple guard group

277
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,400
 and they arrest Jesus.

278
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,720
 And they take him away and they lead him

279
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,680
 and they put him on trial.

280
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,440
 And Peter, we're told, follows at a distance

281
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,200
 that he's watching and he's waiting to see

282
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,680
 what's gonna happen, and he shows up

283
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,000
 and Jesus is brought to the high priest's house

284
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,080
 and he's put on trial there.

285
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,840
 And Peter follows and basically walks outside

286
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,880
 the courtyard to watch and see what's gonna happen.

287
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,680
 In Luke 22, it tells us this, they seize Jesus

288
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,720
 and they led him away, bringing him

289
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,960
 to the high priest's house.

290
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,600
 Peter was following at a distance.

291
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,520
 And when they had kindled a fire, a charcoal fire,

292
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,520
 in the middle of the courtyard and sat down,

293
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,420
 Peter sat among them.

294
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,080
 Then a servant girl, seeing him in the light

295
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,600
 and looking closely at him said,

296
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,780
 this man was also with Jesus.

297
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,440
 But Peter denied it, saying, woman, I don't know him.

298
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,000
 A little later, someone else saw him and said,

299
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,160
 you are one of them.

300
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,080
 And Peter said, man, I'm not.

301
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,700
 Not one of Jesus' followers.

302
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,820
 After an interval of about an hour,

303
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,960
 still another insisted, saying,

304
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,640
 certainly this man was also with him.

305
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,880
 He's a Galilean.

306
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,200
 Peter's accent, we're told in another account,

307
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,040
 had given him away.

308
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,920
 And Peter begins to call down curses on Jesus,

309
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,000
 basically to reflect, would someone who knows him

310
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,400
 curse him like this?

311
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:01,520
 And it says, man, I do not know what you're talking about,

312
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,120
 Peter said.

313
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,860
 And immediately while he was still speaking,

314
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,160
 the rooster crowed.

315
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,280
 And the Lord turned from inside the courtyard

316
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,380
 and he looked at Peter.

317
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,660
 And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord,

318
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,620
 how he had said before the rooster crows today,

319
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,960
 you will deny me three times.

320
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,420
 And he went out and he wept bitterly.

321
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:30,440
 Shortly after Jesus is led away, he's crucified.

322
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,840
 He's buried and three days later, he rises.

323
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,460
 Like I said, he showed up and he appeared

324
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,260
 to all the disciples, but Peter's still covered in shame.

325
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,480
 Over in Jesus' worst moment in life,

326
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,320
 I denied even knowing him.

327
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,680
 The man that I'd followed for three years,

328
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,720
 I saw him allow blind people to see.

329
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,460
 I saw him feed 5,000 people with a Lunchable.

330
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,600
 I saw him allow people to walk again

331
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,360
 who'd been lame their entire life.

332
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,460
 And then after three years and hours after saying,

333
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,260
 I'll die for you, to a middle school girl

334
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,660
 and two other men, Peter says,

335
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,940
 I've never even seen the man before.

336
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,500
 And he's covered in shame.

337
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,740
 And he's wondering what a lot of us want

338
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,060
 when our shame hits us.

339
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,120
 Like, does God want anything to do with me?

340
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,560
 Is God done with me?

341
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,740
 He's back alive, but I don't know

342
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,540
 if he wants me back at all.

343
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,460
 In Mark 16, we're even told that when the angels

344
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,260
 announce Jesus' resurrection, Mary Magdalene,

345
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,240
 these Marys, they show up on the third day, Sunday, Easter.

346
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,220
 They go to the tomb, it's empty.

347
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,740
 There's an angel there.

348
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,980
 And the angel says, he's not here, he's alive.

349
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,060
 Jesus is alive.

350
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,740
 Go tell the disciples and Peter

351
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,580
 that he's coming to meet them.

352
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,320
 Now, why would he say, and Peter?

353
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,380
 He is a disciple.

354
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:55,840
 Maybe because he knew that Peter wouldn't have come

355
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,460
 had they not say, and Peter.

356
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:06,080
 But Peter thinks, man, I'm gonna go back to what I know.

357
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,220
 I'm going fishing.

358
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,020
 It had been three years since Peter had been out fishing.

359
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,940
 And the day that Jesus showed up and he said,

360
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,620
 I'm gonna change you from fishing in the sea

361
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,080
 to being a fisher of men.

362
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,680
 And Peter goes out and decides, I'm going back.

363
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,020
 That's a curve ball.

364
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,480
 This is all for effect.

365
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,220
 And it was a dark and stormy night.

366
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,440
 And behold, Jesus.

367
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,020
 Should we just go movie style

368
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,720
 or throw the Mavs game on or what?

369
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,340
 We're still live on video.

370
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,820
 So if you're tuning in, man, that's creepy, but.

371
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:57,940
 Wait, anything else you should know?

372
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,140
 Are these gonna be down?

373
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,660
 Four minutes.

374
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,380
 This is great, man, all right.

375
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,000
 We're back to old school tent revivals, okay?

376
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,140
 So Peter is wondering,

377
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,180
 is Jesus want anything to do with me?

378
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:23,260
 And all of us have been in a moment

379
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,980
 where man's shame can drive us from God.

380
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,380
 Some key things that ends up happening in people's life

381
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,820
 is a lot of you guys grew up in church

382
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,580
 and you ended up losing your virginity

383
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,640
 at some point in high school

384
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,700
 and making one mistake after the next, after the next.

385
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,340
 And you just been running ever since.

386
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,540
 And you showed up at 25 here

387
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,220
 and you had a relationship with God

388
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:47,220
 and you're trying to get back in the relationship you had.

389
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,500
 But you've been running

390
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,200
 because when you are honest with yourself,

391
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,380
 it's just shame, guilt that you're carrying.

392
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,660
 And Peter's in that moment where he's going,

393
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,420
 I don't know that God wants anything to do with me.

394
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:03,120
 And so he's going out fishing and Jesus shows Peter,

395
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,000
 you think this is about you?

396
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,280
 You think that my relationship with you

397
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,220
 is dependent on your faithfulness to me?

398
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,020
 No, Peter, I'm not done with you.

399
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,060
 He shows up on the shore,

400
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,000
 performs a miracle that I'll highlight again,

401
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,140
 just like the miracle the day that he called Peter

402
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,740
 to come follow him in Luke 5.

403
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,260
 And Peter wrapped up in love,

404
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,260
 jumps into the water and swims towards Jesus.

405
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,180
 But I just wanna highlight,

406
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,980
 I mean, Peter, he ran from God to go fishing,

407
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,720
 but shame can lead us to run from God in all kinds of ways.

408
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,580
 Shame is the reason why some of us,

409
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,280
 when you think about dating someone,

410
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,780
 you hear us talk about dating relationships

411
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,620
 all the time at the porch,

412
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,500
 and we describe, hey, this is the person to look for,

413
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,700
 and this is the type of way you should date,

414
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,060
 and this is who you should seek to be.

415
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,100
 And let me just be blunt.

416
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,700
 A lot of you guys think, man, dude,

417
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,100
 I don't know what fantasy world he lives in,

418
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,900
 but I've never met anybody like that.

419
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,640
 And anybody that is like that, godly guy or godly girl,

420
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,580
 they don't want anything to do with me.

421
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,260
 And you see yourself as damaged goods

422
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,260
 because you carry shame from sexual sin,

423
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,900
 from dysfunctional relationships,

424
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,500
 and it's led you to settle.

425
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,160
 'Cause you think, man, whatever they're describing,

426
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,700
 I'm not a good enough person to have that kind of thing.

427
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,700
 Shame can lead us to run from relationships

428
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,460
 in our past, just run from relationships in general.

429
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,180
 I can't believe that I did that.

430
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,740
 And shame is having tremendous power

431
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,940
 over a lot of our lives.

432
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,780
 And for Peter, like him, turning and running

433
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,020
 from God's call.

434
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,540
 Shame can lead us to not be willing to share our faith

435
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,340
 because I'm going, man, I'm just a hypocrite.

436
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,820
 These friends, they know I could share,

437
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,460
 like, God is working in my life,

438
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,300
 but I would be sharing with these friends,

439
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,900
 and they just know me, they know my story,

440
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,060
 and I'm too ashamed.

441
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,740
 Shame is why I can't believe some of you guys

442
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,980
 are not serving and using your gifts

443
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,460
 and being a part of leading the next generation

444
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,140
 and serving in younger ministries

445
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,620
 because you feel like you're not good enough.

446
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,820
 And it's shame.

447
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,460
 And Jesus shows up on that shore

448
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,840
 to showcase to Peter and to you,

449
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,080
 I pursue those who are shamed,

450
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,380
 who should be ashamed and who are covered in shame.

451
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,660
 And I wanna change that, Peter.

452
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,080
 And Peter experiences it.

453
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,820
 Shame is the reason, often we run,

454
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,980
 it's been that way since the beginning,

455
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,020
 since Genesis chapter three.

456
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,460
 You know what happened in Genesis chapter three,

457
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,900
 Adam and Eve, they eat the apple,

458
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,060
 and then it says that they ran and hid.

459
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,260
 And God called out to them and pursued them.

460
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,140
 He said, Adam and Eve, where are you?

461
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,460
 And they said, we were ashamed.

462
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,620
 And so we ran and hid.

463
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,380
 What's interesting is our natural inclination

464
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,100
 when we feel shame over, you know,

465
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,880
 a substance addiction, pornography that you promised

466
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,320
 you'd never go back to,

467
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,820
 crossing those physical boundaries you said

468
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,020
 you never would, giving into a same-sex attraction,

469
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,620
 you're terrified somebody's gonna find out with it.

470
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,500
 And our natural inclination is to run from God,

471
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,900
 and I'm just gonna avoid it, and I'm gonna run away.

472
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,640
 What's interesting is God's inclination,

473
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,160
 ours is to run from him, his is to run towards us.

474
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,360
 And he did so with Adam and Eve,

475
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,020
 and he does so here with Peter.

476
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,240
 And he shows up and says, I'm not done with you,

477
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,940
 'cause Jesus runs towards us.

478
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,280
 My daughter, often, because she is like three

479
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,520
 or almost four, and she's one of the least

480
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,080
 coordinated individuals I've ever seen.

481
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,120
 So she'll be walking along like she's Captain Jack Sparrow

482
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,980
 or something, and she will, eventually,

483
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,600
 she'll just fall, and it happens like seven times a day.

484
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,520
 And she'll fall down, and she'll begin to cry,

485
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,440
 and she's at that stage where she wants everything

486
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,600
 to be kissed, because that makes it better.

487
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,560
 And so I run to her when she falls,

488
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,560
 and then I pick her up, and all better.

489
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,020
 Now, my heart is not that she would continue to fall,

490
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,920
 but my heart is also not, hey, come on,

491
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,760
 what are you gonna do?

492
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,420
 You're four, you should've known this already,

493
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,780
 you should be able to walk.

494
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:17,900
 Why, because I love my daughter.

495
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,760
 Now, let me ask you this.

496
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,900
 The Bible says God is familiar with your everything,

497
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,700
 your sin nature, the family of origin that you have,

498
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,680
 all the different ways that the temptations

499
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,800
 you struggle with came about,

500
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,900
 the addictions that have marked your life,

501
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,120
 the broken family you were raised in,

502
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,640
 the heartbreak you have felt.

503
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,180
 Do you think the way I love my daughter,

504
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,580
 even when she falls, and I run towards her to pick her up,

505
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,480
 do you think God's capacity for love and care for you

506
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,480
 when you fall, spiritually, sexually, in any way,

507
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,680
 do you think I have more love for my daughter

508
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,480
 than God, eternal, perfect, holy Father has for you?

509
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,600
 He's going, Peter, this has never been about you, man.

510
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,920
 You're covered in shame, and you think

511
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,440
 if only you had behaved, you would be worthy.

512
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,680
 You've never been worthy.

513
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,920
 But I run towards those who are ashamed

514
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,200
 and who are covered in shame to show them my love.

515
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,240
 And my guess is, and I'm gonna move to the next point,

516
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,120
 and all the other three are very quick.

517
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,120
 My guess is something is beginning to click with Peter.

518
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,960
 Why do I say that?

519
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,800
 Here's what's ironic.

520
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,920
 If you've read the Bible, you know this story

521
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,020
 feels eerily similar to another story that happened.

522
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,160
 I referenced it a second ago.

523
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,920
 In Luke chapter five, it's the very first day

524
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,520
 Peter and Jesus ever meet.

525
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,480
 Jesus shows up, huge crowds.

526
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,440
 He can't project to all of them, so he says,

527
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,660
 "Hey, Pete, I need to get in your boat."

528
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,480
 He gets in Peter's boat with him,

529
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,040
 and they go out a little bit off the water.

530
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,200
 Jesus teaches the crowds.

531
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,400
 At the end of the sermon, Jesus says, "Put your net in."

532
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,640
 Peter says, "Jeez, we've been fishing all night, bro.

533
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,960
 "This is kinda what I do for a living.

534
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,520
 "We didn't catch anything."

535
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,040
 And he's like, "Well, try the other side."

536
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,700
 "Well, I don't know if you know this, but fish,

537
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,680
 "it's like, it's not gonna be there

538
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,760
 "just 'cause it wasn't here.

539
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,680
 "It doesn't work that way, but all right."

540
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,600
 And he throws it in.

541
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,080
 And all of a sudden, they get a catch that's so big,

542
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,960
 the boat begins to sink.

543
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,560
 Very similar.

544
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,640
 With one difference.

545
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,700
 One huge difference.

546
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:34,680
 In that moment, Peter throws himself to his knees and says,

547
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,480
 "You need to go.

548
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,440
 "I'm not a good person.

549
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,120
 "You need to get away from me."

550
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,940
 And he realizes, "I'm in the presence of something

551
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,200
 "and someone divine, and I am not a good person."

552
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,920
 It says this in Luke chapter five.

553
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,820
 And he fell down, Peter, and said, "Depart from me.

554
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,580
 "I am a sinful man, Lord."

555
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,440
 And Jesus says, "Don't be afraid.

556
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,200
 "From now on, you will be catching or fishing for men."

557
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,640
 The same incidence happens again.

558
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,080
 Same miracle.

559
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,320
 But this time, Peter doesn't fall on his knees

560
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,720
 and say, "Please get away from me."

561
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,200
 He dives in the water and moves towards Jesus

562
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,900
 as though it's beginning to click.

563
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,760
 That God pursues the broken and the ashamed.

564
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,600
 It's almost hilarious.

565
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,780
 Peter is clearly one of those, like, you know,

566
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,000
 ready, shoot, aim kind of people

567
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,800
 because he throws his shirt on, he dumps in the water,

568
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,400
 and the text reads as though, like, the disciples were like,

569
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,660
 "We were actually really close,

570
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,460
 "but for some reason, Peter just wanted to get in

571
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,300
 "and swim towards him.

572
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,480
 "It didn't make any logical sense."

573
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,760
 They're like, "All right, just let him go.

574
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
 "Let him keep going."

575
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,360
 And they get to the shore, likely even before Peter.

576
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,880
 But Peter was doing what you do when you're in love.

577
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,920
 You're not thinking.

578
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,620
 You're just like, "Man, he's here.

579
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,900
 "He's not done with me."

580
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,120
 And if you tune me out for the rest of the time,

581
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,920
 here's what I want you to walk away with.

582
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,480
 He's not done with you.

583
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,480
 No matter what your story is,

584
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,240
 no matter what you think has put you beyond

585
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,980
 what God wants to do in your life,

586
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:06,400
 that his love, his grace, himself, he's not done with you.

587
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,320
 He wants more for you than you want for you.

588
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,920
 And Peter's seeing all of that firsthand.

589
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,440
 All right, I'm gonna keep moving.

590
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,160
 Verse 20, or verse nine.

591
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,580
 "When they got to the land, they saw a charcoal fire."

592
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,600
 It's really important, we're gonna come back to that.

593
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,560
 "With fish laid out on it and bread.

594
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,980
 "Jesus said to them, 'Bring some of the fish

595
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,200
 "'that you have just caught.'"

596
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,000
 So they got pita bread, fish, first fish tacos right here.

597
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,520
 "So Simon went aboard and he hauled the net

598
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,580
 "full of large fish, 153 of them.

599
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,420
 "And although there were so many, the net was not torn.

600
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,340
 "And Jesus said, 'You guys, come have breakfast.'

601
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,360
 "And they're sitting there at breakfast.

602
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,360
 "And verse 15, when they had finished breakfast,

603
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,520
 "Jesus begins to have a conversation with Simon Peter."

604
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,720
 And we discover later in verses

605
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,820
 that we're not gonna get to,

606
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,520
 that they end up going on a walk together,

607
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,360
 just the two of them.

608
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,400
 The reason I know that is because at the end of the verse,

609
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,480
 or at the end of the chapter,

610
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,080
 we're told that they're having this conversation,

611
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,520
 and at one point, Peter looks back,

612
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,800
 and John has been following them the entire time.

613
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,040
 And he's like, what is he doing?

614
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,080
 And so they're in this conversation walking together,

615
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,920
 and Jesus begins to ask a series of questions.

616
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,320
 And he says this, "Simon, son of John,

617
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,680
 "do you love me more than these disciples?"

618
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,000
 He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."

619
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,220
 He said, "Feed my lambs."

620
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,400
 He said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John,

621
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,360
 "do you love me?"

622
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,940
 And Peter said, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."

623
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,160
 He said, "Tend my sheep."

624
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,560
 He said to him a third time, "Simon, son of John,

625
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
 "do you love me?"

626
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,800
 And Peter was grieved,

627
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,960
 because he said it a third time, "Do you love me?"

628
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,920
 He said to him, "Lord, you know everything.

629
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,400
 "You know that I love you."

630
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,560
 And Jesus said, "Feed my sheep."

631
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,560
 Now, there's two things remarkable Jesus is doing here,

632
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,960
 and I wanna pull these two points

633
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,840
 out of this text very quickly.

634
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,960
 The first is that Jesus is doing what he does

635
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
 for anyone who knows him.

636
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,080
 Jesus redeems our past.

637
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,760
 Why do I say that?

638
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,200
 Here's what just happened with Peter.

639
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,080
 He shows up on the beach, charcoal fire.

640
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,400
 Sits down, has a conversation.

641
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,960
 Jesus wants him to say it three times.

642
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,440
 Do you know the only other occasion

643
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,440
 in all of the New Testament where there is a charcoal fire?

644
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,800
 There's a lot of fires mentioned in the Bible.

645
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,680
 There's only two charcoal fires ever mentioned.

646
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,680
 Here and that night where Peter sat around warming himself.

647
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,040
 And denied the Son of God.

648
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,560
 Sense is one of the strongest, or the sense of smell

649
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,640
 is one of the strongest attachments

650
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,920
 to association of memories that we have.

651
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,600
 It's been said to be stronger than any of the other senses.

652
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,440
 And Jesus is going to redeem his past

653
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,440
 and recreate the moment of his betrayal and denial.

654
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,600
 And say, "I'm not done with you."

655
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,560
 And sitting around that charcoal fire,

656
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,920
 he says, "Peter, do you love me?"

657
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,880
 And there were three denials.

658
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,400
 And now he's saying three affirmations.

659
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,560
 Because Jesus redeems.

660
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,400
 What does redeem means?

661
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,320
 It means to purchase, to exchange.

662
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,400
 And he's exchanging.

663
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,320
 Hey, that doesn't define you anymore.

664
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,640
 I define you.

665
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,480
 Your relationship with me is now what defines you.

666
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,760
 He says, "Do you love me more than these?"

667
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,360
 Speaking about the other disciples.

668
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,120
 'Cause Peter, remember, was the guy who said,

669
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,360
 "If everybody else doesn't follow you,

670
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,040
 "I will to my death."

671
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:50,400
 And Peter is having all of that tragic failure replaced.

672
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:57,400
 And Jesus is saying, "That doesn't define you anymore.

673
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,320
 "Because I am a God who redeems your past."

674
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,040
 Where I relate to Peter,

675
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,480
 and maybe you can relate too,

676
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,640
 is this feeling of like, man, I just,

677
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,000
 I'm disappointing God again.

678
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,360
 Like he looks at my life and he's like,

679
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,840
 "Man, you should be a better leader.

680
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,120
 "You should be a better father.

681
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,280
 "You should be a better husband.

682
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,520
 "You should be a nicer person.

683
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,760
 "You should be more generous.

684
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,160
 "You should be a better,

685
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,080
 "just individual member of the church."

686
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,120
 And I can begin to think like, man, God,

687
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,520
 he's just disappointed.

688
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,560
 Or he wishes I would try a little harder.

689
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,160
 Or I'm just kind of letting him down.

690
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,640
 And Peter's confronted with all of that.

691
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,840
 I'm sure God, when he looks at me, is disappointed in me.

692
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,520
 And he's discovering,

693
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,840
 you didn't disappoint me, Peter.

694
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,160
 I told you this was gonna happen.

695
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,440
 You didn't let me down and surprise me.

696
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,480
 Because I'm God, and I'm what's called omniscient.

697
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,320
 What does omniscient mean?

698
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,520
 It means I know everything.

699
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,240
 Peter, before you denied me,

700
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,720
 I told you you were going to deny me.

701
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,360
 Like you bought this idea that, oh, I'm surprised,

702
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,640
 and I didn't know about that,

703
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,440
 and now you're really disappointed.

704
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,680
 He knows all of that.

705
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,640
 He knows all of Peter's story,

706
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,200
 and he knows all of your story.

707
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,240
 He knows every sin that is in front of you,

708
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,040
 you don't even know you're gonna commit.

709
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,920
 And he doesn't want that, just like any loving father

710
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,720
 doesn't want anything that's gonna harm their children.

711
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,680
 And yet that doesn't move him away from you.

712
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,800
 What's the point of the gospel?

713
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,520
 That's why he moves towards you.

714
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,360
 You didn't disappoint me.

715
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,880
 He knows everything you have ever done, ever thought,

716
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,360
 every sin that you don't even realize was sin.

717
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,760
 And he moves towards you, just like he did here with Peter.

718
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,760
 And he replaces and redeems that past,

719
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,560
 and he's gonna say, you're not defined by that anymore.

720
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,200
 In fact, I'm gonna recreate all of that experience

721
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,240
 and give a new memory in its place.

722
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,680
 Because I'm a God who redeems your past.

723
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,280
 I exchange it for something so much better.

724
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,320
 My son recently lost his first tooth,

725
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,040
 and so we are tooth fairy people.

726
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,360
 If you're not a tooth fairy person,

727
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,800
 you do you, don't judge me.

728
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,720
 Most of you guys don't have kids anyway, so get off me.

729
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,680
 Anyways, he had his first tooth lost,

730
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,240
 and so we were like, oh, we're gonna do the thing

731
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,000
 where you put the tooth underneath the pillow,

732
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,440
 and then you put cash there, which now as a parent,

733
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,000
 you realize that your parents,

734
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,240
 there was no formula to this.

735
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,000
 It basically was like, how much do you have in your wallet?

736
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,280
 Do you have any cash?

737
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,320
 So he gets five bucks, 'cause that's all I had,

738
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,320
 and so I put it under the thing, and I get the tooth.

739
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
 Now, what else you don't realize,

740
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,160
 'cause most of you guys haven't lost teeth in a while,

741
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,640
 is how disgusting a baby tooth is.

742
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,560
 It's just a very like, what am I gonna do with this thing?

743
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,040
 It's just gonna go in the trash,

744
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,340
 and I just gave $5 in exchange for this nasty little thing

745
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,880
 that was clearly not brushed enough,

746
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,320
 and we're just gonna throw it away.

747
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,120
 And this exchange of something good for something gross.

748
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,840
 And in a parallel way, and in a very serious way.

749
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,480
 That's what the gospel is.

750
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,760
 It is God saying, you bring your sin,

751
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,740
 you bring all the decisions that mark your past,

752
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,120
 all the shame, all the guilt, everything you've ever done,

753
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,520
 and I take all of those, and you get the glory

754
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,600
 and the righteousness of Jesus himself.

755
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,280
 The exchange of something gross

756
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,520
 in exchange for something great.

757
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,420
 And he's saying, Peter, this is what the whole message is.

758
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,000
 It's not about you.

759
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,400
 I pursue you in your shame, and I redeem you from your past.

760
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,200
 And then, we see something else

761
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,720
 that he begins to lay out in that conversation.

762
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,920
 He restores his purpose.

763
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,160
 He's like, Peter, I'm not done with you.

764
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,260
 I want you to feed my sheep.

765
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,100
 What's that mean?

766
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:47,920
 Tend to my lambs.

767
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,480
 He's describing the church, and he's saying,

768
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,560
 Peter, I want you to lead the church.

769
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,800
 I want you to teach.

770
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,280
 I want you to pour into.

771
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,160
 I want you to share the gospel and be a part of leading.

772
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,240
 That's what he's saying with the sheep metaphor

773
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,280
 that Jesus uses to describe his followers.

774
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
 I want you to lead, Peter.

775
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,320
 I'm not just done with your past or changing it.

776
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,640
 I'm restoring your purpose.

777
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,480
 The third idea is Jesus restores our purpose.

778
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,360
 I want you to feed my lambs.

779
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,720
 Care for those young in the faith.

780
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,820
 Tend to my sheep.

781
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,880
 Care for those who are part of the faith.

782
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,000
 Eventually, this clicked,

783
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,880
 because Peter went from the coward to courageous,

784
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,280
 and he went from Peter, who was going fishing,

785
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,560
 to leading the church and getting over that shame.

786
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,460
 Had that not happened, Peter, three weeks later,

787
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,400
 is gonna go, and at Pentecost,

788
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,800
 which is the launching of the church,

789
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,680
 he's gonna preach and lead the message,

790
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,800
 and 3,000 people are gonna come to know Jesus,

791
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,520
 all flowing from this moment,

792
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,160
 that Jesus looks in his eyes and he says,

793
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,700
 I'm not done with you.

794
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,280
 No one in this room has denied the Son of God

795
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,080
 after walking personally with him for three years.

796
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,840
 And if Jesus was not done with Peter,

797
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,000
 if he's not done with me, he's not done with you,

798
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,720
 no matter what story you have.

799
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,440
 And he wants to restore your purpose.

800
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,400
 He wants to give purpose to your life.

801
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,040
 (congregation applauding)

802
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,640
 And he looks at Peter and he says,

803
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,840
 man, I'm not done with you.

804
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,200
 And there's a world that is hurting and broken,

805
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,720
 and I wanna restore you to your purpose.

806
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:19,640
 I broke my hand about a year ago.

807
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
 Something interesting happens when you break a bone.

808
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,880
 It grows back stronger.

809
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,000
 And whatever brokenness is in your life and in my life,

810
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,160
 maybe it is from past decisions that you made,

811
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,440
 whatever your story is,

812
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,440
 God wants to take that and heal it,

813
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,040
 and make it not just a source that formerly was broken

814
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,280
 and hurt, addicted,

815
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,460
 but something far stronger and greater,

816
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,940
 and use that part of your story

817
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,240
 to minister to others all the time.

818
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,400
 You know what the best ministers,

819
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,360
 the people who struggle with an abortion in their past are?

820
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,480
 Women who have that in their story.

821
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,600
 There's a ministry called Worthmore,

822
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,120
 all led by women at this church

823
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,720
 who've had that as a part of their story.

824
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,200
 Some of the best ministers that I know of

825
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,160
 as it relates to pornography being in their story,

826
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,200
 like it is mine,

827
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,320
 to care and help and come alongside and encourage men

828
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,460
 who are battling against, or women and men,

829
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,880
 who are battling against lustful thoughts

830
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,320
 are men who have that a part of your story.

831
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,200
 God wants to take that and fuse it and make it stronger,

832
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,040
 not weaker,

833
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,920
 and he restores Peter and he restores purpose to him.

834
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,800
 And the final observation, we see this, verse 18.

835
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,840
 "Truly I say to you, when you were young,

836
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,380
 "you used to dress yourself

837
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,380
 "and you would walk wherever you wanted.

838
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:38,960
 "But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands

839
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,240
 "and another will dress you

840
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,140
 "and carry you to where you do not want to go.

841
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:48,880
 "This he said to show what kind of death

842
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,100
 "Peter would glorify God by.

843
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,640
 "And after saying this, he said to him, 'Follow me.'"

844
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,840
 It's a really interesting thing that he just shared.

845
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,700
 He said, "Peter, when you were young,

846
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,180
 "you used to dress and you'd go wherever you want.

847
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,320
 "There's gonna come a day, a few decades from now,

848
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,380
 "where somebody else is gonna lead you

849
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,320
 "where you don't wanna go,

850
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,820
 "and you're gonna stretch out your arms,

851
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,520
 "and that's gonna be how you die."

852
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:23,540
 The fourth idea we see is Jesus redefines our future.

853
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,420
 Now, let me explain.

854
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:29,640
 He just told Peter,

855
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,560
 "Three weeks ago, you denied me

856
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,520
 "because you were afraid to die.

857
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,740
 "You looked death in the face

858
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,980
 "and you were afraid to die for knowing me,

859
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,040
 "for your faith in me, and so you ran from it.

860
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,660
 "You denied me, but there will come a day

861
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,400
 "where you will be willing to look death in the face,

862
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,440
 "and you will go all in and say,

863
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,980
 "Whatever the cost, he's worth it.

864
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,700
 "And you will die for me, Peter.

865
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,160
 "And you will go on to lead the church

866
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,860
 "like no other person other than Jesus ever has."

867
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,260
 Church history tells us that Jesus did rewrite his story.

868
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,140
 In other words, the coward becomes courageous.

869
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:08,980
 Why do I say that?

870
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,260
 Because eventually, his hands would be stretched out,

871
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,780
 which is a metaphor for crucifixion,

872
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,260
 and Peter would be crucified.

873
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,780
 But in the face of that crucifixion,

874
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,480
 Peter, at the last moment, said, "Don't do it upside!

875
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,020
 "I am not worthy to die like my Savior.

876
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,240
 "Turn me upside down."

877
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,900
 And he was crucified as blood rushed to his head,

878
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,800
 upside down.

879
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:34,680
 For his faith in the Messiah, he denied.

880
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,160
 And Jesus says, "Your story's gonna be rewritten, Peter,

881
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,440
 "and you won't be known as Peter the coward.

882
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:50,140
 "You, for my sake, will be willing

883
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,280
 "to go whatever the cost.

884
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,460
 "I know him, I love him, and I will follow him."

885
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:05,400
 I wanna transition and invite you to do something tonight.

886
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,800
 You were handed a sheet of paper,

887
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,880
 an index card on the way in.

888
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,720
 I want you to take that out,

889
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,640
 and I want you to write something on it.

890
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,240
 And I wanna be very specific about what I want you to write.

891
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,440
 We did something like this a few months ago,

892
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,120
 and yet there are a lot of us that are either new,

893
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,800
 or we're picking up and we're carrying things

894
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,380
 that, if we're being honest,

895
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:27,480
 they seep into how we think God thinks about us.

896
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,000
 And I want you to write on that card

897
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,960
 the thing that you feel shame and you feel guilt for,

898
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,540
 you feel like it defines you,

899
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,320
 the thing that maybe right now you don't even wanna write

900
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,080
 'cause the person next to you doesn't even know

901
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,440
 that's a part of your story and you're afraid to.

902
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,000
 And I want you to write it out and invite you to go

903
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,800
 at whatever point you're ready to go

904
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,320
 and drop it off at any of the bins and say,

905
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,920
 "I'm done with this.

906
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,440
 "This doesn't define me anymore."

907
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,320
 'Cause here's the truth.

908
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,880
 If you're a follower of Jesus,

909
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,440
 if you have trusted that Jesus is the payment for your sin,

910
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,080
 his death and resurrection, it doesn't define you anymore.

911
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,680
 You can have an affair tomorrow with somebody who's married,

912
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,920
 and it doesn't define you.

913
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,860
 You know what does?

914
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,680
 If you are in Jesus, you are forgiven, you are clean,

915
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,080
 you are healed, you are free, you are new.

916
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,240
 That's what defines you for the rest of your life.

917
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,540
 Listen to me very closely.

918
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,420
 For the rest of your life,

919
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:22,120
 in the face of falling for temptation,

920
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,320
 God doesn't want any more than,

921
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,340
 "I want my kids to fall down."

922
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,080
 But that doesn't make her not my kid.

923
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,600
 You are no longer defined by that.

924
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,760
 If you are in Jesus, a lot of you are not in Jesus,

925
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,280
 which means you are defined by those things.

926
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,400
 But for those of us who are, you've been invited by God.

927
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,240
 I'm gonna write this out.

928
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,320
 This doesn't define me.

929
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,040
 I carry this shame, I carry this weight,

930
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,280
 and I carry it with me in life,

931
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,960
 and I'm deciding I'm not doing that anymore.

932
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,640
 I'm gonna look the Savior in the eyes.

933
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,720
 The same Savior that showed up to Peter and said,

934
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,040
 "This doesn't define you.

935
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,040
 "I'm a God who chases after you

936
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,660
 "in spite of all the sin in your life.

937
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,200
 "And I'm gonna redefine your past,

938
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,020
 "and I am redefining your future.

939
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,920
 "I've got more for you, and I'm gonna give you purpose."

940
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,000
 And some of you guys won't do it,

941
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,760
 and some of you guys are gonna write something

942
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,160
 that's honestly not even what you struggle with.

943
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:15,400
 But some of you are gonna experience freedom.

944
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,360
 It's nothing magic and paper,

945
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,620
 but it's deciding this doesn't define me anymore.

946
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,460
 I'm done.

947
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,680
 And I may struggle for the rest of my life,

948
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,480
 but I'm not gonna buy the lie

949
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,600
 that those struggles define me, 'cause He does.

950
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,480
 And the band will come out here in a second,

951
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,520
 and we'll have a chance.

952
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,400
 But right now, wherever you're at, as they play,

953
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,620
 just wanna invite you to write it out,

954
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,920
 whatever that is.

955
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,420
 And our team this week is gonna go around.

956
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,440
 You don't have to put your name.

957
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,400
 We just wanna pray over it.

958
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,240
 And you know what?

959
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,060
 Here's what we're gonna pray.

960
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,440
 God, would you give them freedom from this,

961
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,460
 where they believe that you are who you say you are,

962
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,600
 and you have done what you did,

963
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,380
 and you have done what you have said is accomplished.

964
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,880
 It is finished.

965
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,840
 And we'll have a chance to close out.

966
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,520
 But there's been spread all throughout the room.

967
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,880
 If you're in the balcony, there's some up there,

968
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,360
 there's some down here, there's some over here,

969
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,040
 there's some back there.

970
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,080
 And just whenever you're ready, man, I'm done.

971
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:17,540
 (gentle music)

972
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,960
 (gentle music continues)

973
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,380
 (gentle music continues)

974
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,800
 (gentle music continues)

975
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,220
 (gentle music continues)

976
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,640
 (gentle music continues)

977
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,060
 (gentle music continues)

978
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,480
 (gentle music continues)

979
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,900
 (gentle music continues)

980
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,320
 (gentle music continues)

981
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:55,740
 (gentle music continues)

982
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:09,160
 (gentle music continues)

983
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,580
 (gentle music continues)

984
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:30,000
 (gentle music continues)

985
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,420
 (gentle music continues)

986
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,260
 (gentle music continues)

987
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,100
 (gentle music continues)

988
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,940
 (gentle music continues)

989
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,780
 (gentle music continues)

990
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,620
 (gentle music continues)

991
00:43:52,620 --> 00:44:10,040
 (gentle music continues)

992
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,300
 (gentle music continues)

993
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:18,560
 (gentle music continues)

994
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:41,060
 (gentle music continues)

995
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,320
 (gentle music continues)

996
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,080
 (gentle music continues)

997
00:44:49,080 --> 00:45:03,000
 (gentle music continues)

998
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:06,680
 (gentle music continues)

999
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:20,680
 (gentle music continues)

1000
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:24,360
 (gentle music continues)

1001
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:40,360
 (gentle music continues)

1002
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,040
 (gentle music continues)

1003
00:45:44,040 --> 00:46:00,040
 (gentle music continues)

1004
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,720
 (gentle music continues)

1005
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:20,720
 (gentle music continues)

1006
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,900
 (gentle music continues)

1007
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:44,400
 (gentle music continues)

1008
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,580
 (gentle music continues)

1009
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,260
 (gentle music continues)

1010
00:46:52,260 --> 00:47:15,340
 (gentle music continues)

1011
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,520
 (gentle music continues)

1012
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:45,100
 (gentle music continues)

1013
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:51,100
 - It's funny, I started with telling you

1014
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,400
 kind of the plot of "Lion King."

1015
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,280
 And if you remember,

1016
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:03,100
 the turning point for when he comes back,

1017
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,060
 as silly as it was or silly as it is,

1018
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,280
 even to talk about Disney movies,

1019
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,860
 he's told to remember,

1020
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,860
 remember, remember who you are.

1021
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,860
 And something shifts.

1022
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:22,860
 And in a much more real and true way,

1023
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:28,860
 for the rest of your life, my hope is that when you fail,

1024
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:34,360
 when you fall, when I fall,

1025
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,620
 'cause there's no perfect people on this stage,

1026
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:42,120
 it's just sinful, broken people holding onto Jesus.

1027
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:46,120
 You remember who you are and what defines you,

1028
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,500
 which is Jesus.

1029
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,120
 And when temptation comes to tell you

1030
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,920
 you are damaged, messed up, and how could you,

1031
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,740
 you remember the Savior who runs after the shameful,

1032
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,820
 who redefines our past, who gives us purpose in this life,

1033
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:06,660
 and is redefining and rewriting your story and mine.

1034
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:10,120
 Remember who he says that you are.

1035
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:16,660
 Which is the most true reality about who you are,

1036
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:22,080
 forgiven, clean, new, alive, forever his.

1037
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,660
 And that never changes.

1038
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:30,420
 For those who are in Christ, let me pray.

1039
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,620
 Father, I thank you that you have done

1040
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,780
 what only you can do, which is allow dead people

1041
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,820
 to be made alive, spiritually speaking, by your Spirit.

1042
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,900
 Thank you that many of us have allowed Jesus

1043
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,700
 in his work on the cross to be accepted in our life

1044
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,320
 as the payment for our sin, his resurrection

1045
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,160
 from the grave as proof of that payment.

1046
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,860
 And so would anyone who's never made that decision

1047
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,460
 tonight be their night?

1048
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,900
 Father, would you allow us to live lives

1049
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:56,020
 that are free from shame and regret and guilt

1050
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,940
 and all the different things that fight for our attention

1051
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,360
 and push us away from you?

1052
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,420
 And would we believe what you say about us?

1053
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,300
 And would we run to you, the Father who has,

1054
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,460
 since the moment we were born in this life

1055
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,940
 until the moment we leave it, has been running towards us?

1056
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,700
 We worship you now in song, amen.
