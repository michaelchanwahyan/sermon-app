00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 (rock music)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:25,480
 Check, check, amazing.

3
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,600
 Hello, welcome friends.

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,440
 Welcome friends in the room,

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,520
 friends in Fort Worth, friends in the Woodlands,

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,360
 and in Houston.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,200
 I'm gonna read the text that we're gonna look at tonight

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,300
 as we kick off this brand new series.

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,280
 Thank you, Arts Team, or Team Landscape,

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,120
 for that amazing video.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,500
 You guys are incredible.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,340
 Our volunteer Arts Team creates all the graphics,

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,200
 all the videos, and tons of other stuff that we do here.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,680
 And so, they're incredibly gifted,

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,620
 and they produce stuff like that.

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,240
 I'm gonna read the passage,

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,000
 and then we're gonna kick off this new series.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,840
 But let me read this.

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,040
 This comes from Romans chapter one,

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,840
 starting in verse 18,

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,680
 and then I'm gonna pray,

22
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,140
 and we will dive into tonight.

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,500
 Paul says this.

24
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,140
 The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,380
 against all ungodliness and wickedness of people

26
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,320
 who suppress the truth by their wickedness.

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,020
 Since what may be known about God is plain to them,

28
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,860
 because God has made it plain to them.

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,340
 For since the creation of the world,

30
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,140
 God's invisible qualities,

31
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,060
 his eternal power, and his divine nature

32
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,540
 have been clearly seen,

33
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,360
 being understood from what has been made,

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,620
 so people are without excuse.

35
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,580
 For although they knew God, verse 21,

36
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,580
 they did not honor him,

37
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,320
 or they neither glorified him,

38
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,680
 nor gave thanks to him.

39
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,220
 But their thinking became futile,

40
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,660
 and their foolish hearts were darkened.

41
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,820
 Although they claimed to be wise,

42
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,540
 they became fools and exchanged the glory

43
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,420
 of the immortal God for images

44
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,220
 made to look like a mortal human being,

45
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,900
 and birds, and animals, and reptiles.

46
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,180
 Therefore, God gave them over

47
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,420
 in their sinful desires of their hearts

48
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,420
 to sexual impurity,

49
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,520
 for the degrading of their bodies with one another.

50
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,260
 They exchanged the truth about God for a lie,

51
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,700
 and they worshiped and served created things

52
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,080
 rather than the creator who is forever praised, amen.

53
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,920
 Let me pray.

54
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,620
 Father, just as we do start this series,

55
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:24,860
 and we look back at the role that Christianity

56
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,360
 has played in our country,

57
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,060
 as we look at just the calling

58
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,340
 that you've placed on our lives

59
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,160
 as believers in Jesus, as followers of Christ,

60
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,240
 as it relates to living in a democracy,

61
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,200
 would you give us wisdom?

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,740
 Would you speak from your word?

63
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,320
 Would you move us in the direction

64
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,500
 that you would have us move?

65
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,900
 Would we listen and hear your voice tonight

66
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,020
 as we look back at some of the past,

67
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,620
 and in the weeks ahead as we just explore

68
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,740
 what does it look like for a Christian

69
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,120
 living in this republic, democratic republic,

70
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,500
 to faithfully engage in culture,

71
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,080
 to stand firm in the faith,

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,900
 and to showcase to a watching world

73
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,540
 what it looks like to experience

74
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,060
 the abundant life you call us to?

75
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,060
 Would you strengthen your church,

76
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,380
 and would you begin with us in this room?

77
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,200
 Amen.

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:20,300
 A few weeks ago, I got to go on a date night with my wife,

79
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,860
 and we're in this season where we don't have

80
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,780
 a ton of date nights,

81
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,380
 and so this was something we were looking forward to.

82
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,220
 It was gonna be great.

83
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,140
 We have a 10-month-old that comes along,

84
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,460
 usually because we don't like to pay for babysitting,

85
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,500
 and so we'll bring him along,

86
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,660
 and we're planning on going to Gloria's.

87
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,300
 If you have Gloria's in Fort Worth,

88
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,140
 you know what I'm talking about.

89
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,960
 Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

90
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,660
 Free bean dip, let's go.

91
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,260
 Houston, I'm sorry, I don't know

92
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,220
 if they have that down there.

93
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,460
 So anyway, so we're going to Gloria's.

94
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,320
 We get there, it's the early bird special,

95
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,060
 'cause we got an infant that goes down really early,

96
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,220
 so we're there with like mom and pa,

97
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,460
 and it's five o'clock.

98
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,820
 We go in, we sit down.

99
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,960
 My wife begins to put him in a baby chair,

100
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
 or an infant chair, whatever that's actually called.

101
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,120
 They bring one over to the table.

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,460
 We're sitting at this little four-top,

103
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,940
 me, my wife, the baby.

104
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,020
 She's putting him in the baby chair.

105
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,100
 She gets him all sitting there.

106
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,440
 All of a sudden, she goes to sit down,

107
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,440
 and the waiter has removed her chair from behind her,

108
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,860
 and she has no idea at this point,

109
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,060
 because the waiter was thinking she would sit over there.

110
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,780
 I thought the baby chair would go right here.

111
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,620
 He takes it, walks it right away.

112
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,540
 I didn't see it happen.

113
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,660
 She didn't see it happen.

114
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,700
 She all of a sudden does not look back,

115
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,620
 and she doesn't realize what was there

116
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,940
 that is no longer there,

117
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,080
 and she goes in a moment from just moving.

118
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,940
 All of a sudden, all I see is feet up in the air,

119
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,780
 and she's over there on the ground.

120
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,800
 I'm like, oh my gosh, what happened?

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,820
 I run over, I'm picking her up.

122
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,980
 I'm like, gosh, she's so clumsy.

123
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,980
 I can't take her anywhere.

124
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,860
 And it's not at all what I said.

125
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,540
 And I'm like, what happened over there?

126
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,220
 She realized the chair had been gone.

127
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,820
 Everyone around us all of a sudden sees what had happened.

128
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,420
 It was like the people sitting next to us

129
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,900
 saw this whole thing happen.

130
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,060
 So they're laughing and going, oh man, I'm sorry.

131
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,940
 Is she okay?

132
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,380
 I'm like, yeah, I think she's okay.

133
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,700
 The waiter comes back.

134
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,820
 He's super apologetic.

135
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,140
 It ended up working in our favor

136
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,620
 'cause Gloria's comped the whole thing.

137
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,700
 Thank you, Gloria's.

138
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,820
 And I was like, man, we're gonna do this at every restaurant.

139
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
 You've gotta go in there and move and just fall.

140
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,460
 And it's not true at all.

141
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,500
 But it was one of those moments

142
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,140
 where what she had done is in failing to look back,

143
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,060
 I had to ask for permission to tell this story too,

144
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,100
 by the way, because it's like,

145
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,260
 in failing to look back and see

146
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,340
 what was behind her,

147
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,540
 and specifically to see what was no longer,

148
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,580
 what had once been there but was removed,

149
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,220
 in failing to look back and see what had been there once

150
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,760
 but had been removed, it led to her falling.

151
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,580
 In failing to look behind her, if you will,

152
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,740
 and restore what had been taken away,

153
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,340
 bring the chair back,

154
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,920
 in failing to do that, it led to her falling.

155
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,100
 Now why would I start with a random Gloria's table story?

156
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,460
 The reason is because as it relates

157
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,060
 to the state of our country,

158
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,700
 one of the most problematic things is that we as a country

159
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,340
 have failed to really look back,

160
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,200
 to be educated in a way where we look back behind us

161
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,960
 and we realize what has been taken away from us.

162
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,700
 What was once there, specifically,

163
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,140
 as it relates to the Christian foundation

164
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,140
 that was behind us, and that creates all kinds of like,

165
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,060
 wait a second, I learned in school that this,

166
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,940
 we're gonna address those here in just a second.

167
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,100
 But as a country, we are experiencing

168
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,060
 and have experienced the reality

169
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,340
 that when we fail to look back at what was once behind us,

170
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,680
 specifically a Christian moral foundation,

171
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,400
 when we fail to look back and realize it's no longer there,

172
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,380
 we fail to restore it and bring it back

173
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,540
 and it is leading to the fall of our nation.

174
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,900
 And so tonight, we're gonna explore just that very idea

175
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,620
 as we kick off this series, One Nation Under God.

176
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,360
 Tonight will not be a, it'll just be, honestly,

177
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,100
 a starter for this series.

178
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,060
 And so it's gonna leave lots of different things

179
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,160
 on the table that we're gonna discuss in weeks ahead.

180
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,700
 You don't wanna miss out on those.

181
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,920
 But let me just get this out of the way as well.

182
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,340
 Two things, one, this is gonna be an unusual night

183
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,560
 where it's gonna be scripture-light,

184
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,960
 we're gonna look at those verses,

185
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,900
 but beyond that, we're not gonna look at a ton

186
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,420
 because really, we're gonna teach and educate

187
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,540
 and attempt to inform all of us in the room

188
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,080
 on something that likely you will never hear taught

189
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,280
 outside of this tonight.

190
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,460
 Not because it didn't exist,

191
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,100
 not because it's not very clearly a part of our history,

192
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,700
 but because everywhere you look,

193
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,020
 it's being taught in the opposite direction.

194
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,160
 You're being taught something very not true with history

195
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,220
 and the opposite of what we're gonna talk about tonight.

196
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,040
 So that's the first thing.

197
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,340
 And the second thing is this is not

198
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,540
 a political message at all.

199
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,580
 And so if you're in this message being like,

200
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,220
 I think I know what he's trying to get,

201
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,260
 what he's getting at here,

202
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,260
 I am not getting anything other than what I'm gonna say.

203
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,500
 In other words, this isn't me waving a flag

204
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,840
 for the Democratic Party, for the Republican Party,

205
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,680
 for any party, other than as our senior pastor says,

206
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,180
 the party of the lamb or the party of Jesus

207
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,020
 more than anything.

208
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,140
 And so that's what we're gonna explore tonight.

209
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,540
 And so that may raise some questions.

210
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,060
 I'm gonna do my best to remove them,

211
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,700
 but we are going to look back

212
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:06,300
 and hopefully discover how to restore what's been removed

213
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,540
 so that we don't collectively continue to fall.

214
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,180
 And so three things we're gonna talk about tonight

215
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,460
 or one of the overarching thing we're gonna talk about

216
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,300
 is what made America great in the first place.

217
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,140
 A lot of conversation has been going on about,

218
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,740
 hey, make America great again,

219
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,700
 and how do we make it great again?

220
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,740
 Again, we are not attaching to anyone's political slogan

221
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,420
 here, but we do wanna talk about

222
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,420
 what made America great in the first place.

223
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,280
 Has she been great?

224
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,780
 Specifically, we're gonna talk about what made her great

225
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,540
 and what will make her cease to be great,

226
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,260
 what will lead to her fall.

227
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,260
 Specifically, the first question of is America great?

228
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,300
 So this is very, there's no scripture in this first point.

229
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,820
 I just wanna prove to everyone in the room

230
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,940
 there's something unique that has taken place

231
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,820
 with the founding of the United States of America.

232
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,340
 And that it has become the most prosperous,

233
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,100
 most successful nation distinctly

234
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,020
 from the rest of the world.

235
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,420
 And here's some of the things that we know

236
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,140
 about has America been great.

237
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,980
 America is the most prosperous country

238
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,060
 that has ever existed.

239
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,380
 The gross domestic product,

240
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,660
 which is just like the income,

241
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,140
 if you took everybody's income in the room

242
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,340
 and everybody's income across the different nations,

243
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,060
 you compare them, how much money they all make,

244
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,420
 America makes more than every other nation on the planet.

245
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,060
 Significantly more.

246
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,420
 If you were to combine second place,

247
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,100
 third place and fourth place,

248
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,620
 you would just barely have enough

249
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,820
 to match what America makes.

250
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,500
 We've been the most prosperous economic nation

251
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,340
 in the country.

252
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,500
 We are so opportunistic, we have such opportunity,

253
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,100
 the land of the free, we have opportunity

254
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,220
 where you can do anything.

255
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,420
 We have such, which does not exist in many countries,

256
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,780
 where there's class systems.

257
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,020
 America is so focused on social mobility,

258
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,260
 we have a name for it.

259
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,260
 We have coined a name, it's called the American dream.

260
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,060
 There's no like the Saudi Arabian dream,

261
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,940
 that dream does not exist.

262
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,900
 But we're so like, "Oh man, you can go for rags to riches,

263
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,100
 "anybody can become anything with hard work,

264
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,420
 "opportunity, chance, you can do it."

265
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,820
 By generally speaking.

266
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,140
 We're the most internationally dominant country,

267
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,380
 at least in the modern era that has existed.

268
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,780
 Where we have won two world wars,

269
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,460
 arguably prevented a third.

270
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,660
 We've gone out of our way,

271
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,620
 not only are we internationally dominant,

272
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,100
 we have this thing where we do it with a conscience.

273
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,740
 We go out of our way to help other nations.

274
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,860
 After we defeated Germany and Japan in World War II,

275
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,260
 if you remember from history class,

276
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,420
 we went back and helped rebuild them,

277
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,820
 using our money and our people.

278
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,180
 When the Soviet Union in the 1950s

279
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,340
 surrounded West Germany, if you remember the Berlin Wall

280
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,820
 and Gorbachev dared on this wall,

281
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,660
 if you remember all that,

282
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,700
 whenever West Germany was surrounded by Soviets

283
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,180
 and the Soviets said, "We're cutting off food,

284
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,500
 "we're cutting off supplies,

285
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,220
 "this will not be a free country."

286
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,540
 The United States said,

287
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,900
 "We don't like seeing bullies pick on little guys."

288
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,460
 We flew into West Germany 500,000 tons of food

289
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,500
 for 12 months.

290
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,940
 We landed planes every 90 seconds

291
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,620
 because we said, "We are going to fight

292
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,140
 "for freedom to exist here,

293
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,740
 "and we do not like seeing little guys

294
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,020
 "picked on by big guys."

295
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,700
 We parachuted in candy for the children.

296
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
 We have this international conscience

297
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,420
 that is a part really of even our dominance,

298
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,260
 so to speak,

299
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,300
 we're the only abstaining superpower that's ever existed.

300
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,860
 What do I mean by abstaining superpower?

301
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,060
 Superpower is kind of like somebody

302
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,900
 who rises on the world scene,

303
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,020
 who's like, "Hey man, it's all me."

304
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,580
 America, unlike other imperialistic countries,

305
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,260
 is the only abstaining superpower.

306
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,100
 We are not here to like,

307
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,100
 "We're gonna take Mexico,

308
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,260
 "we've been eyeing you for a while, we're taking it."

309
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,180
 That has never once crossed legislatively

310
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,020
 what you see in America.

311
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,220
 Versus like the British Empire,

312
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,020
 which said, "Hey, we're gonna conquer Australia,

313
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,100
 "we're gonna conquer South America, or South Africa,

314
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,820
 "we're gonna conquer these different places around."

315
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,140
 You still see ripples about,

316
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,300
 America has never been a superpower that is there.

317
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,860
 We'll go in, we'll help, we'll try to bring peace,

318
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,940
 but then we leave.

319
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,340
 We're the most generous nation in history,

320
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,460
 by a wide margin.

321
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,620
 America gives more in foreign aid than any other country,

322
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,780
 it's not even close.

323
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,300
 Are we the only country that gives money to foreign aid

324
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,540
 and to what's broken in our world?

325
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,660
 In our world, no.

326
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,860
 But out of the top 10 humanitarian relief organizations,

327
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,700
 out of the top 10,

328
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,980
 "Hey, these are the most generous organizations in the world,"

329
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,100
 all 10 are American.

330
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,540
 America is not only generous in our funds and resources,

331
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,220
 we're generous in our acceptance.

332
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,860
 That anyone, I mean, it's a part of our national DNA,

333
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,060
 anyone can come to America,

334
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,220
 go through the process of immigration,

335
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,380
 become an American citizen,

336
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,580
 can begin to work, can pursue a job,

337
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,900
 and can make a living.

338
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,340
 It's written on Lady Liberty, the Statue of Liberty.

339
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,220
 This is what's on the bottom of it, you probably heard.

340
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,740
 "Give me your tired, your poor,

341
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,420
 "your huddled masses yearning to be free.

342
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,920
 "The wretched refuse of your teeming shore will take them.

343
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,840
 "Send these, the homeless, tempest-tots to me.

344
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,660
 "I lift my lamp beside the golden door."

345
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,620
 That does not sit outside of normal nations,

346
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,460
 but it's a part of our fabric of DNA.

347
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,700
 We've done more for human rights

348
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,020
 than any other country in history.

349
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,860
 And you may be like, "No, no, no,

350
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,540
 "Europe's all about rights,"

351
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,060
 because we exported it to them.

352
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,220
 There's never been a caste system in the United States.

353
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,220
 There's never been, hey, if you watch "Downton Abbey,"

354
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,780
 where there's the lords and the whatever,

355
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,940
 there's never been any of that here.

356
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,020
 We believe that all men are endowed by their creator

357
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,960
 with equal rights.

358
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,300
 We are the most pro-human rights that there's been.

359
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,700
 Slavery is a dark part of our past,

360
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,680
 but it is a past that,

361
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,860
 in the midst of that terrible mark on our history,

362
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,600
 was Christians who said, "This is wrong,"

363
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,380
 and hundreds of thousands of Americans gave their life

364
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,180
 and spilt blood to eradicate it.

365
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,180
 We've spilt more blood to get rid of history

366
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,340
 or slavery than any other nation,

367
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,500
 because we believe in human rights,

368
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,120
 and we've exported it all around the world around us.

369
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,660
 It's become the norm because America has led the way.

370
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,780
 Education, other countries send their people

371
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,260
 to learn from our colleges.

372
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,740
 China, we think of China as, man,

373
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,780
 they're just so smart over there.

374
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,560
 160,000 Chinese come to the United States

375
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,640
 to learn in colleges every single year.

376
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,160
 They would send more if they could afford it.

377
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,780
 Athletics, we're the most dominant athletically

378
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,620
 in terms of the Olympics that there's ever been.

379
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,820
 There's more American medals than any other nation.

380
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,340
 There's more gold medals than any other nation.

381
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,660
 Culturally, the world listens to our music,

382
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,580
 watches our movies, surfs our internet,

383
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,140
 uses our dollar bills or the American dollar,

384
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,340
 and speaks our language.

385
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,320
 The international language of the world is English.

386
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,460
 We brought democracy as it is known today into existence,

387
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,260
 and we perfected it, and then we sent it back

388
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,900
 to the monarch of France, Spain, Britain,

389
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,380
 and all over our world.

390
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,740
 We invented the telegraph, the light bulb,

391
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,060
 the motion picture or the movie,

392
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,060
 the airplane, the automobile, baseball, football,

393
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,900
 jazz, blues, rock and roll, computer,

394
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,060
 internet, cell phone, smartphone, iPhone,

395
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,620
 email, GPS, chemotherapy, and though we didn't invent

396
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,140
 ice cream, we did invent bluebell.

397
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,540
 (audience cheering)

398
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,500
 Yeah, these colors don't run, boom.

399
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,540
 And Ben and Jerry's.

400
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,820
 America over the last 240 years has distinctly stood out

401
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,980
 on the world stage.

402
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,380
 I mean, there's no question.

403
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,680
 We are not in a time where we're the most pro-patriotic,

404
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,900
 you know, America everything, but there's no question.

405
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,980
 If you look around the world and you look at history,

406
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,360
 there's something distinct about our country.

407
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,660
 So what made America great?

408
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,440
 It's clear that she has been great.

409
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,500
 What has led to her success?

410
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,440
 That's the second question I wanna answer tonight.

411
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,060
 And there's a few answers you could come up with.

412
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,780
 Maybe it is the size.

413
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,180
 You got 360 million people.

414
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,800
 Maybe it's because we're just so big.

415
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,420
 If that was the case, then you would see nations

416
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,540
 like India or China, you'd see other nations,

417
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,920
 Russia that have enormous populations

418
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,040
 also having incredible success.

419
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,440
 It's clearly not the size of the country.

420
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,960
 Maybe it's our model of government.

421
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,240
 You know, maybe it's like democracy.

422
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,760
 Maybe the fabric that leads to success,

423
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,580
 the secret sauce of America is democracy.

424
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,080
 If that was the case, then when democracy is introduced

425
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,120
 to countries, you would think they would flourish.

426
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,120
 And see Iraq, where we set them free,

427
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,480
 we took down Saddam Hussein.

428
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,040
 If you remember that whole thing with Iraq,

429
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,160
 what happened there is we went in,

430
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,340
 we took out Saddam, we were like,

431
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,300
 hey, democracy, go get 'em.

432
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,060
 And they were like, pfft, pfft, to one another,

433
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,100
 and it fell apart.

434
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,340
 And that's what happened.

435
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,860
 That it's clearly not democracy

436
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,940
 and not a model of government that leads to flourishing.

437
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,060
 Maybe it's like geography.

438
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,140
 Maybe it's America, you know, we're in the West,

439
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,580
 North America, maybe it's just kind of where we are,

440
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,500
 you know, fertile and lots of different types of climates.

441
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,340
 Maybe that's it.

442
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,620
 If that was the case, then you would also expect

443
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,500
 to see the same type of success take place

444
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,580
 in South America and the countries down there,

445
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,820
 or in Mexico and in Canada.

446
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,480
 And I'm not saying there hasn't been flourishing

447
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,660
 and they're part of the Western world.

448
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,780
 I'm saying there's something distinct about America.

449
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,620
 What is it?

450
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,380
 And we know it's not just like, oh, because the English,

451
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,740
 the English were superior to everyone else

452
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,940
 because it's just not the case.

453
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,100
 Other places that they landed and tried to introduce society

454
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,100
 they didn't flourish like America.

455
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,940
 What was it?

456
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,600
 What I wanna attempt to convince you

457
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,320
 for the next 20 minutes, if you will,

458
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,220
 is that it is the Christian moral foundation

459
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,640
 that has led to the incredible success

460
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,880
 that we've seen in the United States.

461
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,060
 Specifically, there was something distinct about America,

462
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,900
 about the way it was founded,

463
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,680
 about the faith of the founders,

464
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,880
 about the principles they established it on.

465
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,320
 So that we might look back,

466
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,280
 I wanna show you what is behind us

467
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,020
 by hearing from the voices of these men

468
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,660
 so that we in effort might be able to restore it

469
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,940
 to prevent us falling because we are falling.

470
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,780
 And it's not hard to see beyond the presidential race

471
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,260
 that looks like an SNL skit.

472
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,740
 It's becoming harder and harder to tell

473
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,500
 what's the SNL skit and what's not.

474
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,240
 And so we're gonna hear from the founders,

475
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,500
 why has America been great?

476
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,540
 Because of the Christian moral foundation.

477
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,760
 And a lot of you have been taught that,

478
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,260
 nah, I mean, they weren't really that Christian.

479
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,980
 Like, you know, Thomas Jefferson was kind of a deist, right?

480
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,020
 A deist believes that God is a clockmaker.

481
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,500
 He spun up the world and was like, peace out,

482
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,340
 I'll be back in a little while,

483
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,440
 take care of things for me.

484
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,140
 That is not the faith of Thomas Jefferson.

485
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,340
 It wasn't the faith of any of the founders.

486
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,500
 So I wanna read some of the writings of them.

487
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,340
 By and large, the founders that founded this country

488
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,340
 were Christian, not just in name.

489
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,700
 They wrote of him in a way that was clearly,

490
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
 it was clear they understood the gospel.

491
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,800
 Were there outliers?

492
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,060
 Yes, Jefferson and Franklin to name two.

493
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,900
 But they were very much the minority,

494
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,980
 and even they were steeped

495
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,380
 in a Judeo-Christian perspective.

496
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,260
 They saw the world from a Christian worldview.

497
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,180
 So let me read a few of them.

498
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,620
 Alexander Hamilton, here's one.

499
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,300
 Alexander Hamilton is famous right now,

500
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,800
 if you watched Saturday Night Live this past weekend.

501
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,000
 The guy who is the head of the Broadway,

502
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,980
 Alexander Hamilton, if you've seen the play Hamilton,

503
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,220
 that guy was leading SNL.

504
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,540
 Alexander Hamilton, in his dying words,

505
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,960
 he was one of the secretary of treasurers,

506
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,880
 he's just founding father.

507
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,140
 Here's what he said.

508
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,840
 I have a tender reliance on the mercy of the Almighty,

509
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,780
 through the merits or the works of Christ alone.

510
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,260
 I am a sinner, and I look to him for mercy.

511
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,420
 Pray for me.

512
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,260
 Our George Washington, our first president

513
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,760
 of the United States, kept a prayer book.

514
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,740
 Inside of it, we get access to reading some of his prayers

515
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,500
 of this man who clearly understood who Jesus was.

516
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,940
 There were so many to pick from

517
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,220
 that I just picked one of them.

518
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,300
 Here was one of them.

519
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,880
 Lord, I beseech thee my sins.

520
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,580
 This is George Washington.

521
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,840
 Lord, I beseech thee my sins.

522
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,200
 Remove them from my presence,

523
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,240
 as far as the east is from the west.

524
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,240
 Accept me, Lord, for the merits of thy son, Jesus Christ.

525
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,280
 Bless my family, kindred, friends, and country.

526
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,320
 Be our God and our guide forever,

527
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,440
 for his sake, the sake of Jesus.

528
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,640
 Who lay down his life in the grave and arose again,

529
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,220
 Jesus Christ, our Lord, amen.

530
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,680
 Benjamin Franklin, who's like, oh man, he was a deist,

531
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,620
 he didn't even believe, you know, he's crazy Ben.

532
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,660
 Here's what he says to the Continental Congress

533
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,140
 as they're trying to write the Constitution.

534
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,880
 And they were hitting a roadblock.

535
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,280
 They were in disagreements with one another.

536
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,700
 He turns and he says this.

537
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,260
 I have lived, sir, a long time.

538
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,740
 And the longer I live, the more convincing proofs

539
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,740
 I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men.

540
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,720
 And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground

541
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,020
 without his notice, is it probable that an empire

542
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,980
 can rise without his aid?

543
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,820
 We have been assured, sir, in the sacred writings

544
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,380
 that except the Lord build the house,

545
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,700
 they labor in vain that build it.

546
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,600
 I firmly believe this.

547
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,040
 I therefore beg leave to move,

548
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,060
 that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heaven

549
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,260
 and its blessing on our deliberations be held

550
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,960
 in this assembly every single morning

551
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,540
 before we proceed to business.

552
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,660
 Benjamin Franklin just said, I think that we need to pray

553
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,620
 every morning before we write the Constitution.

554
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,820
 As they were meeting to write it,

555
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,240
 God, please bless America, bless our time together.

556
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,700
 It doesn't seem the writings of a man

557
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,060
 who thinks it's a watchmaker.

558
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,860
 Clearly, even if his faith is complicated,

559
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,140
 it's steeped in a perspective that comes from one place,

560
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,980
 the Bible.

561
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,620
 Sam Adams, known as the father of revolution,

562
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,820
 organized a tea party, said,

563
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,020
 "Jesus alone is the hope for salvation."

564
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,780
 John Adams said, "If a country just sets the Bible

565
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,940
 "as their law, it will become a utopia and a paradise."

566
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,780
 Over and over again.

567
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,460
 Even Webster, the Continental Congress in 1777,

568
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,620
 we're at war, what did they say?

569
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,420
 They say, "Hey, we gotta give all the soldiers in the army

570
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,820
 "two things, a gun and a Bible."

571
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,340
 It was very much a part of the DNA

572
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,460
 and the fabric of our country.

573
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,020
 Not only was it a part of the founders,

574
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,020
 it was a part of the perspective of the people,

575
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,140
 in case you're like, yeah, I guess the founders,

576
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,900
 you know, the top 1%, but were the people Christian?

577
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,320
 Here's what we know about the Christian practice

578
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,160
 of the people.

579
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,860
 Do you know the first celebrity in the United States was?

580
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,900
 Like, I mean, before there was like Selena Gomez

581
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,020
 and Justin Bieber and the Kardashians,

582
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,600
 who was the first celebrity in the United States?

583
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,620
 He had two initials, GW.

584
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,940
 George Whitefield.

585
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,940
 And you're going like, what?

586
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,780
 Didn't see that coming.

587
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,500
 Who is George Whitefield?

588
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,320
 George Whitefield, no, it wasn't George Washington.

589
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,500
 He wasn't even the most famous guy with the initials GW.

590
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,960
 George Whitefield was a Bible teacher.

591
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,360
 Scholars say that the most famous person

592
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,080
 prior to the Revolutionary War,

593
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,600
 right around that time, was George Whitefield.

594
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,680
 What did he do for a living?

595
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,000
 He taught the Bible to people.

596
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,440
 It is estimated by scholars that 80% of the people

597
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,120
 in the colonies heard George Whitefield.

598
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,720
 Everywhere they went, they flocked.

599
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,020
 Now, why do I tell you that?

600
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,120
 Not to prove like, oh man, they'd all heard him.

601
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,460
 I'm trying to prove that the culture of the times.

602
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,900
 Imagine what it would take today

603
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,520
 for the most famous person in our land to be,

604
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,280
 and specifically the most famous outside of the royal family

605
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,760
 is what scholars believe.

606
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,280
 So out of King George in England and the royal family,

607
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,520
 the most famous person was George Whitefield,

608
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,800
 who was a pastor, a traveling Bible teacher.

609
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,320
 What would it take today in a culture where like,

610
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,640
 the Kardashians are who we look to,

611
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,480
 or Justin Bieber, whatever it is,

612
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,280
 for our culture to see the most famous people would flock,

613
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,280
 they'd go anywhere to hear a traveling Bible teacher.

614
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,520
 It was steeped in the practice of the people.

615
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,200
 The French nation sent someone named Alexis de Tocqueville,

616
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,620
 who came here to study America.

617
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,400
 The French had had a revolution.

618
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,960
 Basically like France was like, oh man,

619
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,920
 America just went through this revolution.

620
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,880
 It looks like things are going good.

621
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,000
 We should go study them.

622
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,720
 1830, they send this guy over.

623
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,200
 He gets on a boat, gets over there.

624
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,760
 He's like, hey guys, I'm here to take some notes

625
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,960
 and learn about America.

626
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,020
 Alexis looks around.

627
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,060
 He writes a 12-volume book called Democracy in America.

628
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,440
 And here's what he writes.

629
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,160
 There's so many different things that he says

630
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,360
 about the Christian faith that was everywhere,

631
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,960
 but he writes this.

632
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,800
 There is no country in the world

633
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,420
 where the Christian religion retains a greater influence

634
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,520
 over the souls of man than in America.

635
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,240
 America is great because America is good.

636
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,040
 If America ever ceases to be good,

637
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,320
 America will cease to be great.

638
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,680
 All over our founding was this new way of thinking,

639
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,680
 this Christian moral foundation

640
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,400
 was at the heart of our founding.

641
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,640
 Even so much of the way that you think today,

642
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,520
 that Americans think, that I think today

643
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,360
 is all steeped in Christian values.

644
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,440
 Like it's so hard that we can't even believe it

645
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,400
 because it's the world, it's all we've ever known.

646
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,440
 It's everywhere that we look.

647
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,200
 We've only known a world where we think

648
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,280
 it's natural and normal that everyone should think,

649
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,020
 oh man, women have rights.

650
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,500
 Even me saying that is like, dude,

651
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,000
 did you just like suggest they may not have rights?

652
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,380
 You'd be like, that's ridiculous.

653
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,220
 We think that's normal.

654
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,280
 We think everyone should think,

655
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,900
 yeah, of course, men and women have rights.

656
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,320
 We think that the weak should not be abused by the strong.

657
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,040
 We think men and women should be treated fairly.

658
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,360
 We don't think that the disabled

659
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,800
 should be taken advantage of.

660
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,360
 We don't think anyone should be taken advantage of.

661
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,760
 We think everyone, regardless of their skin color,

662
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,640
 regardless of the amount of money they make,

663
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,280
 Bill Gates and a homeless guy, same value.

664
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,640
 No better.

665
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,320
 And we think that's normal.

666
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,740
 You were taught that.

667
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,740
 That comes from a Christian perspective

668
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,340
 that is so steeped in our thinking,

669
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,700
 we don't even realize that it all comes back

670
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,660
 to one place, the Christian moral foundation.

671
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,820
 Here's how you can like look outside and see,

672
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,020
 huh, yeah, I guess that's not normal to everybody.

673
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,780
 If you look around our world, it becomes very apparent.

674
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,100
 They don't think like us.

675
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,260
 Like when you look in the Middle East,

676
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,780
 there's a reason why if anybody went on vacation

677
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,100
 this past summer, I'm guessing at the top 10 of your list

678
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,660
 was not like, yeah, so I spent a little time

679
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,420
 in Afghanistan and then Pakistan,

680
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,800
 and then just decided to stop by Syria

681
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,340
 to see what they had going on.

682
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,640
 And then I decided to, you know,

683
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,320
 Saudi Arabia seems beautiful.

684
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,160
 They have the shore, Mediterranean,

685
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,400
 just was great, pita bread, oh, it was great.

686
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,440
 None of us think that way.

687
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,660
 Here's why, here's why people are not flocking over there.

688
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,920
 Because women can't drive cars in Saudi Arabia.

689
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,880
 Because if you attempt to be, if you're a woman

690
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,320
 who tries to get educated, who even suggests

691
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,160
 that girls should be educated in Pakistan,

692
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:31,160
 you're liable to be shot and killed, and have been killed.

693
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,160
 Even in Asia, you look around,

694
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,320
 there's 160 million more men than women in Asia

695
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,600
 because of the one-child policy of China.

696
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,360
 And people, if they have a baby girl, they'll kill it.

697
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,060
 Or they'll use selective abortion.

698
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,660
 And you look around the world, it becomes very clear,

699
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,040
 they don't think like we think.

700
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,860
 There's something different in they don't think

701
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,700
 like we think.

702
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,460
 And we think like, yeah, I know, and it's wrong.

703
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,880
 Everybody should think that way.

704
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,900
 You were taught that.

705
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,780
 You were taught that everyone has value.

706
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,500
 You were taught that everyone is endowed by their creator.

707
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,780
 And I believe with all my heart,

708
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,240
 it's the truth that everyone has dignity and rights.

709
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,200
 Because the scripture tells me that it's true.

710
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,220
 And we stand on the firm foundation

711
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,180
 that they don't stand on.

712
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,860
 Specifically, even the countries I named

713
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,380
 of like, you're not going vacationing there,

714
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,060
 they don't have a Christian foundation.

715
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,580
 Think about that.

716
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,540
 They have an Islamic foundation.

717
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,180
 And this isn't some effort to rally anger

718
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,060
 towards Islamic thinking or Islamophobia

719
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,300
 other than it is not, not all world views are created equal.

720
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,220
 And the Christian worldview is steeped

721
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,820
 in the way that you and I think.

722
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:49,800
 Chinese sociologists also studied America more recently.

723
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,020
 So Alex Tocqueville did in 1930s for France.

724
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,940
 He said, "Man, America, I think it's the faith

725
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,780
 "that they have."

726
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,980
 Here's what Chinese sociologists came and studied America

727
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,300
 and here's their conclusion.

728
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,260
 This comes from the chief editor for Time Magazine,

729
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,360
 David Aikman, who was the correspondent in Beijing

730
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,200
 for a number of years.

731
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,540
 He wrote "Jesus in Beijing."

732
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,380
 It's a book.

733
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,740
 And in there, he talks about this lecture that he attended

734
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,100
 with 18 other American people that was held.

735
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,060
 It was being a lecture.

736
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,260
 This Chinese sociologist and a number of them

737
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,380
 were given this lecture on their studies

738
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,540
 of what they thought led to the success of America.

739
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,740
 You can read it in his book,

740
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,280
 "Jesus in Beijing," Time Magazine.

741
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,780
 He says that the Chinese sociologist said this,

742
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,460
 "One of the things that we were asked to look into

743
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,860
 "was what accounted for the success,

744
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,580
 "in fact, the preeminence of the West all over the world.

745
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:45,060
 "We studied everything we could from your historical

746
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,720
 "to your political, economic, and cultural perspective.

747
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,420
 "At first, we thought it was because you had

748
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,720
 "more powerful guns than we had.

749
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,040
 "Then we thought it was because you had

750
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,220
 "the best political system, democracy.

751
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,820
 "Next, we focused on your economic system, capitalism.

752
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,080
 "But in the past 20 years, we have realized

753
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,400
 "that the heart of your culture is your religion.

754
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,720
 "That is why the West has been so powerful.

755
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,540
 "The Christian moral foundation of social

756
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,120
 "and cultural life is what made possible

757
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,140
 "the emergence of capitalism

758
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,440
 "and the successful transition to democratic politics.

759
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,360
 "We don't have any doubt about this.

760
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,920
 "Studies reveal that in rural areas of China,

761
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,060
 "where traveling evangelists," we call them missionaries,

762
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,440
 "introduce the Christian faith,

763
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,360
 "opium addiction goes down, crime drops,

764
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,560
 "and Christian families grow wealthier than their neighbors.

765
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,280
 "Even other countries, despite our reluctance

766
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,420
 "to acknowledge it, look on and they say,

767
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,040
 "'Huh, I don't know why they've been so successful.'

768
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,680
 "Their faith, their Christian perspective

769
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,240
 "then informs and has allowed for capitalism to flourish,

770
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,340
 "has allowed for democracy to take place.

771
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,540
 "And it is the thing that allows

772
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,580
 "and will allow us to not fall.

773
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,340
 "But we're in a time and place where it is continued

774
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,300
 "to be removed and removed from society,

775
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,340
 "and the church, more than ever before,

776
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,340
 "needs to stand up and continue

777
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,040
 "to not just pick it out in the streets,

778
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,800
 "but continue to love and move forward.

779
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,880
 "The mission is more important than ever before,

780
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,040
 "as our country continues to move and spiral down."

781
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,900
 So the third idea from this talk tonight

782
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,200
 is will or why will America fall?

783
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,880
 Or why will she cease to be great?

784
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,700
 We read early in Romans one that Paul just says,

785
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,260
 "Hey, the wrath of God is revealed from heaven."

786
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,380
 And here's how the wrath of God is revealed against heaven.

787
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,860
 He basically says that, hey,

788
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,300
 they begin to suppress the truth.

789
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,240
 Like what happens, when you wanna see God's wrath,

790
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,960
 this is so crazy, 'cause I think a lot of us think,

791
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,920
 oh man, God's wrath, I got a cold today,

792
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,240
 or a lightning bolt struck him,

793
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,400
 or man, I'm running late today,

794
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,680
 God, why are you angry?

795
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,600
 And Paul says, "The wrath of God is revealed

796
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,940
 "from heaven against people

797
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,120
 "who begin to suppress the truth

798
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:07,580
 "and run after vices, after sin,

799
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,120
 "and God will not just stop them

800
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,460
 "or hit 'em with a lightning bolt,

801
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,880
 "he'll let them keep going.

802
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,160
 "He'll even let them suppress the truth that God exists."

803
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,080
 I mean, it's Paul's words, it's Paul's passage that is,

804
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,800
 we hold these truths to be self-evident.

805
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,280
 Paul, what's self-evident?

806
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,680
 That God exists.

807
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,440
 And you see it in the creation around us,

808
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,500
 and any person who says God does not exist

809
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,920
 is clearly experiencing just the wrath of God

810
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,880
 because he's letting them run from him.

811
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,880
 But he says, any time that a person runs from God,

812
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,520
 they run towards destruction.

813
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,700
 They run from the truth and towards a lie.

814
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,540
 So how will America fall?

815
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,660
 Paul just told us the way a person falls

816
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,980
 is they run from their creator.

817
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,820
 They worship created things, maybe it's a job,

818
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,100
 maybe it's money, maybe it's sex,

819
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,980
 maybe it's a dating relationship, maybe it's whatever.

820
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,300
 He says, any time that someone runs from that,

821
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,700
 and God in his wrath, which is a terrifying thing,

822
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,140
 he will allow people to run,

823
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,980
 or that's what he's saying,

824
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,240
 he will allow people to run,

825
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,700
 or that's one of the ways you see his wrath.

826
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,300
 And Christ, we're not talking about Christians here,

827
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,160
 as you have been placed under a totally different covenant.

828
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,600
 But Paul says, when you run from God,

829
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,220
 you invite destruction into your life.

830
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,420
 That's how a person falls.

831
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,160
 So how does a democracy fall?

832
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,960
 A democracy is a government of the people,

833
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,100
 a bunch of people.

834
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,880
 So the way you bring down an individual person

835
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,180
 is that person runs from God.

836
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,980
 The way you bring down a democracy

837
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,100
 is the people begin to run from God.

838
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,180
 That's the problem, honestly, with democracy.

839
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,700
 Because if everybody's corrupt,

840
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,140
 if everybody's like, yeah, man,

841
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,220
 we should all cut off our hands, that would be cool.

842
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,220
 Who wants to vote?

843
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,100
 51% cut off our hands, cool, we're all doing it together.

844
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,920
 All of a sudden, you're like, oh, man, we are toast.

845
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,580
 If a democracy is only as strong

846
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,580
 as the people that make it up,

847
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,140
 if the people are corrupt, the democracy's corrupt.

848
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,140
 Aristotle, this Greek thinker, said democracy,

849
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,820
 he was a guy who wrote a bunch of different books,

850
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,660
 influenced lots of people.

851
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,500
 He basically said, hey, of all the governments,

852
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,740
 democracy's the worst one

853
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,020
 because the people are too corrupt to be able to handle it.

854
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,740
 America has defied that for 240 years

855
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,620
 because of a Christian foundation, which is disintegrating.

856
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:37,380
 One of the scholars have really put the perspective

857
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,060
 and beliefs of the founders

858
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,820
 into something they called the golden triangle of freedom,

859
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,180
 which is so directly related to this.

860
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,700
 I'm gonna try to make this engaging again,

861
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,260
 where a guy named Oz Guinness,

862
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,860
 and basically these thinkers said, hey, this is,

863
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,100
 let me give you a framework

864
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,180
 for how the founders thought about freedom.

865
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,260
 They said it could only work

866
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,660
 if these three things were a part of it.

867
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,000
 So in other words, if these things disappear,

868
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,100
 you will not be able to sustain a free society.

869
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,060
 They said that the golden triangle of freedom,

870
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,860
 which I think we have a slide for, contains this.

871
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,220
 It says that freedom,

872
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,620
 the nature of freedom requires virtue.

873
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,620
 Like in order to be free,

874
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,340
 you have to have some element of virtue.

875
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,740
 Like in order for me to not be a heroin addict,

876
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,040
 I have to say, yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

877
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,820
 In order for me to remain free from that,

878
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,660
 I have to not do that.

879
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,900
 That's an extreme example,

880
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,360
 but in order to maintain freedom,

881
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,500
 they said you have to have a level of virtue.

882
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,660
 You have to voluntarily say

883
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,660
 that I'm not going to murder somebody

884
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,020
 even if I get away with it.

885
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,620
 And in order for people in society to flourish,

886
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,060
 freedom requires virtue.

887
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,420
 That virtue, by essence of what it is,

888
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,140
 it requires faith.

889
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,060
 That you can't just require or say,

890
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,860
 hey, everybody be virtuous.

891
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,400
 I want everybody to only sleep with their spouse.

892
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,460
 You can't just require and demand it.

893
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,420
 So virtue, the founders believed, required faith.

894
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,740
 It required a set of beliefs.

895
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,300
 It required a person could only govern,

896
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,420
 we could only be a self-governing people.

897
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,700
 Like hey, we're self-governing.

898
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,440
 We govern ourselves if we know

899
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,680
 how to individually govern ourselves.

900
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,260
 And the founders believed this.

901
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,260
 So they believed that Christianity or morality, religion,

902
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,020
 was the best encouragement that man had

903
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,900
 to encourage society to flourish, to encourage virtue.

904
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,140
 John Adams said this.

905
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,340
 We have no government armed with the power

906
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,860
 capable of contending with the human passions

907
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,700
 or human nature.

908
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,740
 In other words, there is not a government strong enough

909
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,100
 to fight against human nature if it's unbridled

910
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:43,100
 or doesn't have bridling it, morality and religion.

911
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:47,580
 Our constitution was made for a moral and religious people.

912
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,540
 It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.

913
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,380
 But Adams says, if we get rid of religion,

914
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,900
 we will not be able to hire enough police.

915
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,420
 And we will self-destruct.

916
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,300
 That is our second president of the United States.

917
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:09,820
 The third thing, so freedom requires virtue.

918
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,360
 Virtue requires faith.

919
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,700
 And faith requires freedom.

920
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,440
 A part of the founding of a country was like,

921
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,160
 hey, we're gonna have freedom of religion.

922
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,620
 Everyone is free to worship any way that they want.

923
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,460
 Here's why that's so important.

924
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,420
 Here's why that's so important.

925
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,620
 The founders were rebelling against a state church.

926
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,340
 That's why the First Amendment was written in.

927
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,300
 Because in England, hey, you're church of England

928
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,520
 or you're dead, okay?

929
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,360
 So we're gonna have this like,

930
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,740
 hey, everybody gets to worship where they want.

931
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,540
 If you don't worship here, we're gonna kill you.

932
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,900
 Bloody Mary and the battles with the Catholic Church

933
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,580
 in England, they were rebelling against that.

934
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,220
 The Catholic Church had taken over France and Spain

935
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,300
 and was an integral part of that.

936
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,580
 And so, hey, you're Catholic or you're gone.

937
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:53,220
 And so all of this state church had really influenced

938
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,420
 the thinking of the founders where they said,

939
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,460
 everyone's gonna be free.

940
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,460
 You cannot have true religion if we enforce it by law.

941
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,960
 Like if I'm forcing you to come to church and worship God,

942
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,120
 you're not actually worshiping God.

943
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,960
 Does that make sense?

944
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,900
 And so the founders said, look,

945
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,720
 in order for faith to truly take place,

946
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,800
 true religion is free religion.

947
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,080
 People have to choose to do it or it's not true faith.

948
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,760
 And they said, faith requires freedom.

949
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,760
 And if you lose any of those, you will forfeit your freedom.

950
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:28,720
 Franklin, Ben Franklin said, the more vices a people has,

951
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,840
 the more they need masters and dictators

952
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,360
 because they can no longer govern themselves

953
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,520
 and they'll fight and war with one another.

954
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,720
 And as we continue to eradicate faith from our society,

955
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,720
 we will eradicate virtue and eventually eradicate freedom.

956
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,280
 And we will destroy ourselves just as Paul said,

957
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,620
 anytime a people runs from God,

958
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:01,620
 they run from the source of life, order, and peace.

959
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:07,020
 And it is a drift that is happening.

960
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,300
 I mean, it's not hard to see like, man,

961
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,740
 if you drift as a nation towards away from faith,

962
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,580
 like things just don't go well for you.

963
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,820
 You can see it all over Europe.

964
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,760
 You could see it, let's take a look at Amsterdam specifically.

965
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,460
 One example, inside of Europe,

966
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,500
 once during its golden age,

967
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,940
 Amsterdam was considered the epicenter

968
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,420
 of Protestant Christianity.

969
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,740
 It was known for its churches.

970
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,740
 It was known for the faith

971
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,820
 and the people that was producing.

972
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,100
 It was known for a way of life very different than today.

973
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,900
 Today, it is known for, it is secular.

974
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,420
 The church has drifted from its place or from that nation.

975
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,180
 And it is known for sex slavery or for prostitution

976
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,460
 for very different reasons.

977
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,620
 Anytime a nation drifts or runs from God,

978
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,260
 they invite and bring destruction on their land.

979
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,340
 And it is happening as a Christian faith

980
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,220
 continues to be removed and restricted.

981
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,420
 And the church, which has done a horrible job

982
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,240
 of standing up and not compromising,

983
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,100
 anytime the church is weakened in a nation,

984
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:14,540
 the nation becomes morally weak

985
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,240
 and moves towards destruction.

986
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,020
 We are already seeing signs of decline in our country.

987
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,880
 It is a more divided nation than ever before.

988
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,980
 We have $20 trillion in debt.

989
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,940
 The disintegration of the family

990
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,420
 has happened in the last 50 years.

991
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,840
 In 1965, 5% of children were born to single mothers.

992
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,620
 Today, it's over 40%.

993
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,840
 Think about that.

994
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,460
 In the African-American community,

995
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,660
 the black community, it's 72%.

996
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:48,220
 In the Hispanic community, it's 53%.

997
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,340
 All over, I mean, in the white community,

998
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,980
 it's just right there with the Hispanic community.

999
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,260
 The Asian-American community is doing honestly the best.

1000
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,180
 Now we're seeing this disintegration of the family

1001
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,020
 all over the place.

1002
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,340
 We're seeing enormous amounts of death.

1003
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,560
 One in three children are raised in poverty in America,

1004
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,280
 according to a UNICEF study that came out a year ago.

1005
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,280
 One in three below the poverty line.

1006
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,100
 Is it any wonder as our nation moves from God,

1007
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,300
 pornography is the most successful industry in America.

1008
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,940
 Pornography makes more money than the NBA,

1009
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:26,220
 MLB, and the NFL combined.

1010
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:32,560
 It is more common today to be raped than to be a smoker.

1011
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,400
 Think about that.

1012
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,060
 And our nation, as it continues to run from God,

1013
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,980
 is gonna continue to spiral and continue to fall

1014
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,000
 if it does not restore what has been removed.

1015
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,820
 And even our political leaders,

1016
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:53,260
 I don't know what degree,

1017
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,500
 like, you guys have been following any of that stuff,

1018
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,560
 but are we really surprised?

1019
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,820
 Our leaders are a reflection of the culture around us.

1020
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,180
 If some of them have said crazy things,

1021
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,820
 which are horrendous,

1022
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,980
 they're not things that are not being said in rap songs,

1023
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,940
 in sitcoms, all over the place.

1024
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,460
 Is it any surprise?

1025
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,940
 And our nation will continue to spiral

1026
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,520
 until the church steps up and is the church,

1027
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,620
 'cause here's what we know.

1028
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,160
 Like, our hope, and I'm about to close

1029
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,540
 and land the plane right here, our hope is not in America.

1030
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,260
 As Christians, our hope,

1031
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,380
 our, like, if you're a follower of Jesus in the room,

1032
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,480
 your hope, my hope, is not in America.

1033
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,720
 But you are the hope of America,

1034
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,280
 because you're the body of Christ.

1035
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,600
 You are the closest that anyone will ever be to Jesus.

1036
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,880
 It's you.

1037
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,280
 The democracy that is around us,

1038
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,720
 the democratic republic, if you call it that, which it is,

1039
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,600
 but the democracy that we're a part of

1040
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,500
 will only be as strong as the church that makes it up.

1041
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,820
 If you're a follower of Jesus Christ,

1042
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,360
 that is your responsibility and mine.

1043
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,900
 Because America's not our hope, you're the hope of America.

1044
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,240
 And the question that's been asked of us,

1045
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,060
 will we rise up and be the church more than ever before?

1046
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:07,000
 It is crucial that our mission as followers of Jesus

1047
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 to do whatever we have to, by whatever means possible,

1048
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,720
 to allow people to know the God who loved them so much

1049
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,920
 he would die for them.

1050
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,120
 And take the message of Christianity

1051
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,560
 all over to every place and space in our town,

1052
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,680
 in our city, in our state, and in our country.

1053
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,840
 'Cause you're the hope.

1054
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:27,200
 I love what one man said where he just said,

1055
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,180
 "Look, Jesus did not come to take sides,

1056
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,080
 "democrat, republican, he came to take over

1057
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,680
 "and take over the hearts of people and change the world.

1058
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,740
 "And as the body of Christ,

1059
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,140
 "you're the means he's doing that through."

1060
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,620
 And that's our role, that's our hope,

1061
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,820
 that's our application.

1062
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:46,860
 Because if we do not restore that is not restored,

1063
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,480
 we will continue to fall.

1064
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,820
 I'll close here.

1065
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,660
 I like,

1066
00:42:53,660 --> 00:43:00,260
 I think in a weird way,

1067
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,940
 we're like this rose as a country.

1068
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,960
 And follow me.

1069
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,200
 (congregation laughing)

1070
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,560
 I feel like this is like, just became The Bachelor.

1071
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,900
 (congregation laughing)

1072
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,600
 If this thing, like it looks pretty,

1073
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,860
 like it's like, oh man, it's a good looking rose.

1074
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,960
 This thing is dying.

1075
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,840
 It's cut off from its roots.

1076
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,060
 Like it looks beautiful today,

1077
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,860
 but I don't know if you've ever been around flowers.

1078
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,500
 I'm guessing for the girls, for sure you have,

1079
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,560
 and if guys, hopefully you have.

1080
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,360
 If this thing is not placed in water,

1081
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,280
 it's gonna die quickly.

1082
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,400
 And here's what, no matter how much water we put in it,

1083
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,940
 in a week, this will not look like this.

1084
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,280
 Like it may look somewhat pretty right now,

1085
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,240
 but be assured, it is dying

1086
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,080
 because it is cut off from its roots.

1087
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,600
 The church in America

1088
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:57,800
 is the only hope of reconnecting our country to its roots.

1089
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,600
 Our nation will be like this flower will be in a week,

1090
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,840
 and that it may look pretty right now,

1091
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,800
 you're like, "Yeah, but look, dude,

1092
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,840
 "I got the new iPhone 7.

1093
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,180
 "I mean, my life is pretty good.

1094
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,540
 "I mean, things are going fine.

1095
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,740
 "The economy's okay.

1096
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,780
 "Everything looks okay.

1097
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,380
 "Everything still looks pretty."

1098
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:16,480
 But when things get cut off from their roots,

1099
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,280
 their foundation, they begin to die.

1100
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,680
 And so it will be for us

1101
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,080
 if we do not reconnect and reestablish,

1102
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,640
 go back to the America the founders dreamed of,

1103
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,560
 the America that Jesus loves a lot more

1104
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,400
 than you and I ever will,

1105
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,080
 because he loves people

1106
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,340
 and the people that made up and make up America.

1107
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:46,680
 I don't know if you're like,

1108
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,780
 I like have this weird, I've always loved our country.

1109
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,080
 And I don't know, anybody like,

1110
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,600
 anybody love America in here?

1111
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,040
 Hopefully you do more of this message.

1112
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,040
 I think even from like a young age,

1113
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,200
 I like find writings.

1114
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,320
 I was looking through in this past week

1115
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,600
 'cause I was like trying to find an illustration

1116
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,640
 for something and I was looking at stuff

1117
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,120
 that was all like, man, as a six-year-old,

1118
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:06,940
 man, I just love America.

1119
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:07,780
 Everybody should move to America.

1120
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:08,620
 I love America.

1121
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,080
 Here's what you and I love about America.

1122
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,320
 And what will continue to be lovable about America

1123
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,360
 or will cease to be an America worth loving

1124
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,340
 is not the American culture.

1125
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,720
 It is the Christian culture.

1126
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,320
 And man, I want that with all of my heart.

1127
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,600
 And I know in this room,

1128
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,760
 there's men and women who share that desire,

1129
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,880
 who share the desire that, hey, all over the city,

1130
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,760
 all over this town, all over this country,

1131
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,680
 we're gonna take the message of Jesus Christ.

1132
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,920
 It is the Christian culture that provides freedom.

1133
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,520
 It is the Christian culture that says every person,

1134
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,880
 man, woman, red, yellow, black, and white,

1135
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,240
 all of them are precious in his sight.

1136
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,540
 All of them deserve dignity.

1137
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,860
 All of them should be treated with care, with opportunity.

1138
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,960
 All of them have rights.

1139
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,740
 That is the Christian message.

1140
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,520
 And if there's any part of you,

1141
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,480
 if you walk out of here tonight,

1142
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,360
 you're like, man, they're just like all about America

1143
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,200
 in this place.

1144
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,480
 I'm like more like world-focused.

1145
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,920
 We're all about Jesus.

1146
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,040
 And we're all about people knowing Jesus.

1147
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,840
 We think that America is not our hope.

1148
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,780
 We are the hope of America because of Christ.

1149
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:10,080
 And if you're not a Christian,

1150
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,980
 you're not the hope of America.

1151
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,840
 But there's a hope you need to know, and that's Jesus,

1152
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,040
 your savior who loved you and died for you,

1153
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,500
 the savior of George Washington,

1154
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,840
 the savior of the men who founded this country,

1155
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,040
 the savior of our world, of every Pakistani,

1156
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,420
 every Saudi, every English person,

1157
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,480
 everyone who's ever lived,

1158
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,280
 and the only one who offers hope to a world who needs it

1159
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:41,880
 and life, and who when we follow will lead us

1160
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,120
 as a person and as a people to life.

1161
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,560
 Let me pray that be the case.

1162
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,840
 Father, would you heal our land?

1163
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,160
 You tell us that if your people,

1164
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,760
 in the Old Testament, speaking of Israel,

1165
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,080
 now as the New Testament,

1166
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,760
 your people, the church, will humble themselves,

1167
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,360
 repent, will seek your face,

1168
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,500
 then you will hear from heaven and you will heal their land.

1169
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:09,240
 God, would you heal our land?

1170
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,420
 Father, we need you.

1171
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:18,560
 Would you help us to stand firm as followers of Jesus

1172
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,640
 as we look at a government that is spiraling out of control

1173
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,400
 and realizing that we live not in a monarchy.

1174
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,640
 We don't submit to a king.

1175
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,040
 We submit to a savior and we live in a democracy.

1176
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,800
 And so we, the people, millions of Christians,

1177
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,240
 if they act like Christians and follow Jesus,

1178
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,240
 are more forceful, more powerful,

1179
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,340
 have more influence than any political leader ever will.

1180
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,840
 Would you strengthen your church, Lord?

1181
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,920
 And would you multiply it all over this world?

1182
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,360
 Would you bring freedom, and equality, and rights

1183
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,720
 through the power of forgiveness

1184
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,160
 that is found in Jesus alone in every nation,

1185
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,700
 in every place, in every space, Lord?

1186
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,160
 Would you come quickly?

1187
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:04,060
 Would you bless our nation by turning our nation to you?

1188
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,880
 Amen.

1189
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:12,600
 - Dude, that's the best version of God Bless America

1190
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,960
 there's ever been.

1191
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,100
 Man, we love you guys.

1192
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,680
 We wanna make sure you know about a few opportunities

1193
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,360
 that are coming up and it's so perfect.

1194
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,840
 We were talking about the blessing of God on America,

1195
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,920
 that the worst thing God can do

1196
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,920
 is financially bless our country if we're running from him.

1197
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,760
 So sometimes the blessing of God looks like,

1198
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,000
 hey, I'm just gonna turn you guys back to me

1199
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,520
 through whatever it takes,

1200
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,440
 through a broken political system,

1201
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:41,440
 through a less than ideal president on,

1202
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,080
 yeah, I'll just stop there.

1203
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,840
 Sometimes he turns through a recession,

1204
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,080
 through whatever it is, man.

1205
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,920
 And that's the most loving thing he can do,

1206
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,800
 to do whatever it takes, I'm gonna turn you back.

1207
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,220
 And so we're praying that that would take place.

1208
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,880
 That's why they sang that part right there.

1209
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,800
 We wanna make sure you guys know

1210
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,880
 about a couple opportunities.

1211
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,820
 If you wanna talk about anything that you heard tonight,

1212
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,400
 we'd love to talk with you, we'd love to pray with you.

1213
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,640
 If you're walking through something down front,

1214
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,000
 we'll have volunteers that'll be here to connect with you.

1215
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,960
 We'd love to meet and love to speak with you.

1216
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,240
 If you're not in a community group,

1217
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,380
 tonight is an opportunity for you

1218
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,920
 to get to connect with other men and women.

1219
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,760
 We think that no one should have to walk through life alone.

1220
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,740
 And so if you don't have a small group of people

1221
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,680
 that come around you and encourage you

1222
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,520
 in your walk with Jesus,

1223
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,560
 my guess is that walk is lonely

1224
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,120
 and a lot more difficult than God wants it to be.

1225
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,640
 And so tonight you have a chance to get plugged in.

1226
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,960
 If you're a guy, you can go right down

1227
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,160
 this little hallway right here.

1228
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,440
 There'll be a room right at the end of it.

1229
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,440
 You can meet and connect in a small group with other guys.

1230
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,440
 If you're a girl,

1231
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,380
 you can go right down the edge of this hallway.

1232
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,640
 If you are new here and you're looking for information

1233
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,280
 about, man, what are all the opportunities

1234
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,480
 that exist at Watermark to get connected,

1235
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,160
 to find out kind of like what we believe

1236
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,840
 or what is our vision, values,

1237
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,200
 what opportunities to serve in the city,

1238
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,040
 all those things.

1239
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,460
 We have something called Next Steps,

1240
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,400
 which is just essentially, if it's your first time,

1241
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,240
 we wanna make sure you know everything that's available

1242
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,880
 to answer any questions you may have.

1243
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,320
 That'll be in the chapel,

1244
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,560
 which is right outside of these doors.

1245
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,720
 If you go up these stairs right here,

1246
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,680
 you'll see the chapel.

1247
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,760
 And in college, we'll be in stage two,

1248
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,960
 partying tonight.

1249
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:07,900
 You don't wanna miss it.

1250
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,740
 We love you guys.

1251
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,440
 You guys have a great week of worship.

1252
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,680
 (cheering)
