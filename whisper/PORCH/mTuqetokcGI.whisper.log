[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840]   - Hey guys.
[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.520]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.360]   How's it going?
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.840]   Awaken, it is so good to be here.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.560]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.360]   And I feel like causing trouble today,
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.360]   so somehow I am praying that God will use this evening
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.040]   to not just teach you something.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.240]   In fact, I don't care if you learn something new.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.520]   I think you probably know plenty.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.320]   I am praying that the wind of the Spirit
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.880]   would blow in this place,
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.320]   and that there would be people that walk out of here
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.720]   convicted to go onto the mission field,
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.560]   both in their workplace and across the globe.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.980]   I am praying that there would be conviction in this room,
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.680]   that there would be a sense of,
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.480]   you know what, the Spirit rising up in me,
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.980]   and I'm gonna say things that I've never said out loud
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.520]   before I leave this place.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.560]   I'm gonna pray that the Spirit is gonna move you
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.020]   to do things that you never, ever, ever, ever wanted to do,
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.720]   because that is how our God moves.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.160]   And so let me start by reading a little story,
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.960]   and a lot of you are probably familiar with this story.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.960]   But hopefully tonight it will feel fresh to you again.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.280]   1 Samuel 17.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.480]   "Saul and the men of Israel were gathered,
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.600]   and the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side,
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.320]   and on Israel they stood on the other mountain
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.640]   on the other side with a valley between them.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.980]   And there came out from the camp of Philistine
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.720]   a champion named Goliath, who was really, really big.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.480]   He had a bronze helmet on his head
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.640]   and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze,
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.280]   weighing a whole lot.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.960]   On his legs he wore bronze thingies,
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.440]   and a bronze javelin was slung on his back.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.440]   His spear shaft was really big,
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.320]   and its iron point weighed 600 shekels.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.800]   His shield-bearer went ahead of him,
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.880]   and Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel,
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.600]   'Why do you come out and line up for battle?
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.560]   Am I not a Philistine,
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.000]   and are you not the servants of Saul?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.600]   Choose a man and have him come down to me.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.880]   If he is able to fight and kill me,
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.440]   he will become your subjects.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.780]   But if I overcome him and kill him,
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.640]   you will become our subjects and serve us.'
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.460]   So their freedom was on the line.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.400]   The nation of Israel's freedom was on the line,
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.160]   and this man, Goliath, is taunting all of God's people.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.520]   Then the Philistine said,
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.600]   "This day I defy the armies of Israel."
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.240]   In other words, I defy their God.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.000]   On hearing the Philistines' words,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.880]   Saul and the Israelites were dismayed and terrified.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.120]   Now David was a son of Jesse,
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.040]   who was from Bethlehem in Judah.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.320]   Jesse had eight sons,
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.920]   and his oldest three sons had followed Saul to the war,
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.000]   but David went back and forth from Saul
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.360]   to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.240]   For 40 days, the Philistines came forward
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.500]   every morning and evening, and they took their stand.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.600]   Now Jesse said to his son David,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.980]   "Take these 10 loaves of bread for your brothers,
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.040]   and hurry to the camp.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.560]   Take along these 10 cheeses to the commander of the unit."
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.480]   I just never noticed that before,
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.120]   and it wasn't in my storybook Bible,
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.560]   but this is full-on charcuterie
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.520]   like David is carrying into battle.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.840]   10 cheeses, I mean, that's wild.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.180]   Okay, sorry.
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.480]   "See how your brothers are,
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.240]   and bring back some assurance from them."
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.920]   So he shows up, this is my interpretation.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.480]   So he shows up and sees Goliath
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.640]   and all the Israelites cowering and afraid,
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.400]   and he is annoying his brothers,
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.960]   trying to figure out what is going on.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.820]   And he seems like a pest for a few paragraphs.
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.180]   And then David said to Saul,
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.700]   "Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine.
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.960]   Your servant will go and fight him."
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.880]   Okay?
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.080]   So David's watching all the armies
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.400]   stand around and be dismayed and afraid,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.960]   and he's trying to figure out what's wrong.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.560]   Why, we are God's people.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.600]   Anyway, he's bothered.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.760]   And so he decides, "I'll fight him."
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.480]   Saul replied, "You are not able to go against the Philistine
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.320]   and fight him.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.440]   You are only a young man,
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.000]   and he has been a warrior from his youth."
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.660]   But David said to Saul,
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.560]   "Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.140]   When a lion or a bear came
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.180]   and carried off a sheep from the flock,
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.760]   I went after it, struck it,
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.240]   and rescued the sheep from its mouth.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.880]   When it turned on me, I seized it by the hair,
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.040]   struck it and killed it.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.520]   Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.200]   This uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.680]   because he has defiled the armies of God.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.760]   The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.920]   and the paw of the bear will rescue me
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.440]   from the hand of this Philistine."
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.000]   Don't you love him?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.840]   Love him.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.660]   Okay.
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.280]   Saul said to David, "Go and the Lord be with you."
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.560]   Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.680]   He put a coat of armor on him
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.340]   and a bronze helmet on his head.
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.440]   David fastened on his sword over the tunic
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.800]   and tried walking around because he was not used to them.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.440]   He said, "I can't go in these," he said to Saul,
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.400]   "because I'm not used to them."
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.800]   So he took them off.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.600]   Then he took his staff in his hand,
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.960]   chose five smooth stones from the stream,
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.320]   put them in his pouch, his little shepherd bag pouch,
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.320]   and his sling in his hand, and he approached the Philistine.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.640]   I know y'all have heard this before, but it is so good.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.360]   And then the next paragraph, he gets made fun of
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.760]   and ridiculed for a few paragraphs.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.120]   It's significant, but moving on.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.360]   "But David said to the Philistine,
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.800]   "You come against me with sword and spear and javelin,
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.160]   "but I come against you
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.160]   "in the name of the Lord Almighty,
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.400]   "the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.300]   "This day, the Lord will deliver you into my hands
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.680]   "and I will strike you down, cut off your head."
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.020]   And then he did that.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.300]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.020]   God, the same God,
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.220]   the same God that watched his people
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.340]   on the side of the mountain,
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.020]   staring at a simple man, a big man, in fear.
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:41.180]   I cannot imagine, God, how frustrating that is for you
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.180]   to watch your people stand on the sidelines in fear.
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.980]   Well, God, you wanna do great things.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.540]   And so, God, I believe, I mean,
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.740]   what I see out of this room happening
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.180]   is unbelievable works through your spirit
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.380]   and for your glory.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.660]   So, God, would you rise those things up in my friends?
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.640]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.820]   But first we're gonna gamble.
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.060]   So I need to start.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.420]   I need to start by saying, this is my friend, Stephen.
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.260]   Everybody say hi to Stephen.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.100]   - Hello.
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.500]   - Hi, Stephen.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.180]   So, Stephen, how many times have you gambled in a church?
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.020]   - Never.
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.860]   - Okay.
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.740]   So, Stephen, let me say first of all,
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.320]   that I don't believe in gambling.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.580]   - Me neither anymore.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.180]   - Dangerous. - I've learned my lesson.
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.180]   - Don't do it.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.300]   - But I will teach lessons.
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.300]   - But I'm not gonna gamble real money today.
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.700]   We're just gonna use these tokens that say $5,000 instead.
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.380]   So today, this is the analogy we're gonna use.
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.740]   And I wanna teach you about the game of roulette.
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.260]   And then we're gonna look at David's life
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.100]   and the game of roulette.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.500]   We're gonna come up with some facts and some truths
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.940]   that we're gonna apply to our lives.
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.440]   How many of you know the game of roulette?
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.940]   Actually, don't raise your hand.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.660]   So we're gonna get judged.
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.500]   All right.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.780]   So this game right here, in fact,
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.220]   I'm gonna ask my son to come up,
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.300]   who's one of the volunteers here this weekend.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.940]   Connor Allen, just graduated Texas A&M.
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.500]   (congregation cheering)
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.700]   So he's gonna gamble, except without money.
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.300]   Oh yeah.
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.540]   So here's what I know,
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.540]   is that there is a reality to this game
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.060]   that I've learned on YouTube.
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.960]   And Stephen, I'm gonna teach them
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.100]   about roulette from YouTube.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:31.940]   - Please, I would love to learn.
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.820]   - And I have a feeling you're about to interrupt me.
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:34.980]   I just am gonna.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.820]   So let me teach you a few bets,
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.060]   because they're gonna apply.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.140]   First bet, you can start making a bet.
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.860]   You go, good luck.
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.860]   The first bet I'm gonna teach you is the outside.
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.740]   - They are the easiest bets on this game.
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.580]   - Yes. - Go ahead.
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.420]   - They are the easiest bets and the most likely to win,
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.820]   because you're really picking between red and black.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.580]   It lands on red, you get--
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.260]   - Red. - Double, double your money.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.580]   - Even money.
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.980]   - Okay, oh, he's going, okay.
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.820]   - One to one.
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.520]   - And then you land on black, you get the same thing.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.900]   So this is a 50% chance I'm gonna win.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.100]   - Correct.
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.420]   - Then you go into the table a little bit more,
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.000]   and then there's some more complicated bets
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.160]   that I want you to learn.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.100]   So the first thing is, I know about the corner bet.
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.900]   What's the other one called, the split?
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.220]   - There's a split bet, 17 to one.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.980]   - Okay, tell us about that.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.980]   - Okay, so seven or the eight hits.
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.020]   You know, when you spin the wheel,
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.380]   the seven or eight hits, you get 17,
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.820]   depending on how much dollars you have left.
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.320]   If it's a dollar, it's 17, two dollars is 34, and so on.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.800]   And of course, that's 17 for a split.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.100]   Corners are the four numbers.
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.660]   Any one of those four pays eight to one.
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.640]   - Eight to one.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.860]   Okay, I want you to take this in.
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.880]   Eight to one, four squares, okay?
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.840]   What are you gonna do?
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.180]   - I just want you to tell people the real reason
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.680]   that you know all this about roulette.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.940]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.240]   - I've gambled one time.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.620]   I'm about to tell my son this.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.520]   I gambled one time, and I was really good at it,
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.960]   but it was just the slots.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.220]   I turned $20 to $200, and then I lost it all,
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.560]   and my husband took me out and said,
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.620]   "You can never gamble again," because I loved it so much.
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.860]   I turned around, and I looked at him, and I said,
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.460]   "Why do we not do this all the time when I'm not gonna do it?"
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.260]   And he turned white.
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.340]   That's the only time I've gambled.
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.100]   So I don't know roulette, except for,
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.000]   actually, the YouTube channel that taught me this
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.780]   was called Totally Depraved.
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.480]   Didn't make that up.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.320]   All right.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.140]   - Not a shout out.
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:41.980]   - All right, let's do it.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.820]   Are we ready?
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.640]   Let's do it. - Absolutely.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.480]   - Let's go.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.520]   So if it hits on any of the numbers
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.320]   that my son has placed a bet on,
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.120]   he wins money, but loses money, too?
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.120]   - Absolutely.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.200]   Only one number's gonna hit out of 38 numbers,
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.560]   36 plus the two zeros, or the zero and double zero,
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.860]   we land on a three.
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.560]   - But you, but he had red.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.040]   - Hey, thank goodness we have a couple of thousand on that,
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.900]   because everything else lost.
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.740]   - Okay.
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.840]   - So we would just swipe everything away,
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.880]   and we would pay what one?
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.220]   Which she won. - Just a little bit.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.920]   - $4,000. - Yes.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.080]   - If you wanna take that kind of risk.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.380]   And there you go. - Very good.
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.920]   Very good. - And then we do it again.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.920]   - All right.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.760]   All right, thank you, Stephen.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.600]   - You take your win,
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.800]   split it around however you wanna do it,
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.900]   if you wanna try it again,
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.360]   or you can go cash it in at the cashier's cage.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.160]   - So you did all right.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.000]   Good job.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   All right, y'all thank Stephen and my son, Connor.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.840]   - Absolutely.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.340]   (congregation applauding)
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.980]   - Let me tell you why I am starting
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.640]   with these two things today.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.180]   I've been off for three months.
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.880]   I have been on a sabbatical.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.880]   And in that time, I enjoyed myself.
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.720]   I actually had a lot of fun.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.320]   I have a really, really great family.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.020]   I like them.
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.160]   I really like them.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.420]   Like it's not pretend, I think they're really fun.
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:07.160]   And I'm really content living the life
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.700]   I've lived the last three months.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.400]   In fact, I'm probably in a lot of ways more content.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.000]   But I'm supposed to come back.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.540]   And the reason I'm supposed to come back at least today,
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.280]   who knows, tomorrow might be a different story.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:25.280]   But today, why I'm here and not at home
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.180]   is because I actually really believe in you.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:36.360]   And I actually really believe what David shared last night,
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.400]   that the time is short and that we don't have long.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.340]   And when I picture your lives,
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:50.340]   and I picture over 3,000 of you going into your places
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:55.380]   and obeying God, something rises up in me
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.520]   that says, I don't want to choose comfort.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.560]   I want to choose obedience.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.260]   And so what we're gonna talk about tonight is risk.
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.360]   Because in my experience,
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.300]   following God has typically been risky.
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.600]   In fact, not very much time goes by
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.540]   that he's not calling me to risk in some way.
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:27.380]   And the reason that I picked this topic as I'm coming back
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.120]   is that I actually believe
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.480]   that good works were prepared in advance.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.980]   Ephesians says that good works were prepared
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.320]   in advance for you to do.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.420]   That there are things that God has written into your story,
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.860]   gifted you for, like David shared,
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.260]   and prepared you for to accomplish
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.060]   that will change the kingdom of God.
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:54.140]   Godly, obedient risk.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:58.740]   But I'm gonna speak widely to your generation,
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.980]   meaning I'm gonna say people in their 20s, early 30s,
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.080]   I think you're playing very small.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:11.060]   I think you're playing very small.
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.520]   And that would be okay if there wasn't much on the line,
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.020]   but guys, we don't know that there isn't a lot on the line.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.720]   In fact, just biblically speaking,
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.200]   even if Jesus doesn't return for generations,
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.740]   there's always a lot on the line, right?
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.640]   And so what I wanna start with tonight
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.340]   before we get into this,
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.200]   I want you to envision something
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.940]   that you have felt God prompt you to do,
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.280]   that you have imagined that should be done on the earth,
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.580]   something that feels kind of audacious,
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.180]   that, or maybe it's just scary.
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.480]   In fact, let me define risk for you,
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.660]   'cause this helped me a lot.
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.860]   This is just out of the dictionary right here, ready?
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.160]   An action exposing you to danger, harm, or loss.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.160]   An action exposing you to danger, harm, or loss.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:09.160]   So what is God calling you to do?
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.840]   Or maybe it's as simple right now, today,
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.000]   as just what do you think should be done?
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.720]   And I want you to come up with something in your mind,
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.340]   because this is a part of teaching
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.520]   where a right typical response in my preparation
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.060]   would be to name a lot of different options for you,
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.220]   to say, "Hey, I could picture it being this,"
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.120]   or, "I could picture it being this."
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.960]   But I really felt hesitant to do that,
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.900]   because I actually think God is way more creative than me.
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:45.300]   And I believe that he will bring something into your mind
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:50.300]   that I would never have thought of or imagined,
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.480]   because that's how he works.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.680]   That's how he works.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.320]   And so this is what I wanna do first.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.120]   I want you just to say that out loud.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.120]   Maybe it's not something you're going to do,
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.160]   but it's something you think should be done.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.260]   Can we start there?
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.760]   Something in your generation.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.860]   Now, I'm gonna add one more little part to it.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.780]   I want you to imagine that Jesus is coming back in 10 years.
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.600]   What would you do?
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.820]   What would you do if you knew 10 years from today,
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.880]   Jesus was coming back?
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:32.020]   What would need to be done and what risk would you take?
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.920]   And I want you to tell your neighbor, go.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.580]   (water rushing)
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.240]   (water rushing)
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.900]   (water rushing)
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.560]   (water rushing)
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.220]   (water rushing)
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.880]   (water rushing)
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:58.180]   (water rushing)
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:16.880]   (water rushing)
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.540]   (water rushing)
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:25.780]   Okay, yell some things out.
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:31.180]   (congregation shouting)
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:40.960]   Foster children.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.160]   Sex trafficking.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.920]   (congregation shouting)
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.960]   Become a pastor.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.180]   Okay.
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:18:00.460]   I love it.
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:10.500]   (congregation applauding)
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.600]   (laughing)
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:19.660]   Yeah, I'm feeling like this is going downhill fast.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.840]   Okay.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.100]   I believe there are good works that God prepared you to do
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.900]   and I believe that we can miss them.
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.140]   I believe it is possible to waste your life.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:39.480]   I believe that we play small because we forget that.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.460]   So the corner bet.
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.860]   I like the corner bet.
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.460]   It's kind of in the middle.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.620]   One to eight odds.
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.080]   You are unlikely to get this.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.420]   In fact, Stephen was telling me out there, he goes,
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.920]   this is the worst game in the whole casino.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.420]   Never play roulette.
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.380]   The odds are never in your favor.
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.020]   Look how many numbers there are.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.780]   But the corner bet, you're saying one, four, five, or two.
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.580]   Guys, let me tell you something.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.160]   Every single one of you is placing a bet in this life.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.480]   You are placing a bet.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.420]   You may not realize that you're placing a bet.
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.320]   You're not thinking about it, but you're placing a bet.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.020]   Let's start with red and black.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.480]   That's the most careless thing you can do.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.520]   You have a good chance of winning.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.380]   That's the one my son won.
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.720]   Red or black, 50/50, you're only gonna double your money.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:37.020]   But a lot of you in life aren't even thinking about this.
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.920]   You've casually tossed a chip in with God
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.860]   or a chip in with the world.
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.220]   You like that, Jesus, the world?
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.420]   So good, black, red.
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.460]   Plays out so great.
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.020]   Gotta redeem it somehow, y'all.
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:54.020]   You casually do that.
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.320]   You're not overthinking it.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.460]   You barely even think about what you're doing
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.580]   or why you're doing it.
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.180]   I think that is a lot of us.
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.560]   Corner bet.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.620]   One, two, four, five.
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.380]   This one is a little more strategic.
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.780]   In fact, probably most of the girls in here
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.580]   will relate more to this than the other one.
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.580]   This one, you're planning it out.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.160]   But you're gonna put your chips on a few things.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.620]   You're gonna say, you know what?
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.720]   I do think Jesus is real, yes.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.420]   But I also wanna get married, yes.
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.780]   And I also would like a cute dog.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.980]   And I want a good job.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.620]   And I wanna make enough money that I can shop.
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.780]   And that's okay.
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.620]   It's okay.
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.760]   None of that's bad.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.760]   But there's definitely a assessment of risk.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:52.720]   If I go all in here, then I may not get this.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.960]   And I may not get this.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.320]   And I may not get this.
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:04.160]   Every one of you is putting your hope, your money,
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.460]   your time, your passions, your curiosity,
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.760]   all of you are putting your money somewhere.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.160]   You're putting it somewhere.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:19.320]   And how divided it is, it's interesting,
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.460]   the lower the payout.
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:26.120]   So if I put it on a row, Stephen's in the back going,
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.500]   don't do it, Jenny, you're gonna mess it up.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.960]   If I put it on a row, if I put it on a section,
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.200]   this section right here, then I have the odds go way down.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.100]   But if I get anything in this,
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:40.520]   and that's what we do is we spread it out so far
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.000]   so that hopefully something works out for us.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.200]   Seek ye first the kingdom of God
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.400]   and all these things will be added to you.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.600]   And yet we are trying to get all these things
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.500]   and adding God to that.
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:01.920]   Next, small risks lead to big risks.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:07.560]   Small risks lead to big risks.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.860]   Okay, let's look at David.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:15.020]   Do you think most shepherds today or even back then
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.160]   have stories like there was a lion and there was a bear?
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.680]   Do you think that that was common?
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.820]   I don't think that was common.
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:25.320]   I'm like, dude's sitting with a harp in the field
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.160]   watching sheep.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.860]   I don't think bears and lions were like all over the place,
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.860]   but God sent David a bear and God sent David a lion.
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.940]   Why?
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.720]   Because he knew there would be a Goliath.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:48.700]   See the way risk works is it rarely is that God
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.820]   is gonna ask you to move to China
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.620]   and be a part of the underground church.
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.380]   That's not how it usually works.
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:59.320]   What happens is he will ask you to serve in the nursery.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:04.600]   Like he will put something in your spirit that says,
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.440]   you know what?
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.500]   I think I'm supposed to sign up to lead Sunday school.
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.760]   One of my son's best friends,
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.220]   I sat by him in church the other day
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.780]   and he had to dart out really quickly and he leaned over.
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.100]   He was like, I've got to go.
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.340]   My kids are waiting for me.
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.260]   And he's leading five-year-olds in church.
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:24.540]   He's 25, 26 years old and they love him.
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.780]   His name's Grady.
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:30.780]   And he was like, but Mrs. Allen, I love them more.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.100]   He said, I don't want them to graduate.
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.140]   And this is the week that they're gonna go up
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.020]   and I'm so devastated that I'm not going with them.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.020]   Sometimes that risk, and he said,
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.160]   I don't know why I did it.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.460]   I just felt like I was supposed to get more involved.
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.460]   I was supposed to serve.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.860]   Like, I could, I should.
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.380]   It was just a little bitty risk.
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.060]   But here's the thing about risks.
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.940]   When I took my kids cliff jumping, they're terrified.
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.820]   They're going off a cliff this big.
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.800]   They're terrified till they do it once.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.680]   And then guess what?
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.500]   They're looking at the next higher cliff
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.300]   and they're like, let's go, let's go on the higher one.
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.420]   And then they're jumping off of that.
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.820]   And before long, I'm weeping in the fetal position
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.180]   because they're jumping off of a 10-story building
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.100]   into the water.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.180]   My offspring, right?
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.260]   That's how it goes.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:21.220]   Gets bigger and bigger because we get conditioned.
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:26.540]   We realize that if we jump off that cliff, that we're okay.
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:30.020]   Not only are we okay, but this is fun.
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.820]   And this is what we were built for.
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.680]   That's how God works.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.580]   This isn't some scary thing
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.220]   that he's calling you into drudgery.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.900]   He is actually calling you into the abundant life
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.260]   that you're missing if you don't live this way.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.640]   Obedient, risk, fast tracks, growth.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.400]   Now, I know this morning TA talked about,
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.760]   he talked a little bit about sin.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.480]   And he talked about our bodies and what they were made for.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.080]   And some of you have struggled
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.920]   with the same sin for a decade.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.520]   And you don't know how to change.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.480]   And you don't know why things aren't changing.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.080]   Some of you have been looking for purpose in your life
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.400]   since you were 12 years old,
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.200]   and you still don't know what it is.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:30.480]   Risk, fast tracks, growth.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:36.960]   It causes you to actually want God because you need God.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.800]   When you're standing there going,
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.920]   "I'm scared and I don't know how to do this.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.600]   "And I feel empty and I don't know if this is gonna work.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.520]   "And I don't know if this risk
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.320]   "is actually gonna prove worth it."
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.400]   I have been there so many times.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.880]   And guys, I'm on my knees and my favorite two words,
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.080]   I prayed it yesterday and put it on Instagram,
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.600]   is help God, help God, help God.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.480]   And guess what?
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.320]   When you are saying help God, what does that look like?
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.840]   You are fixing your eyes on Jesus.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.880]   You are running the race that was set before you.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.400]   And it says that the sin and the burden
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.240]   that so easily entangles you starts to fall off.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.040]   That's Hebrews 12.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.600]   It starts to fall off.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.440]   Why?
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.560]   Because you're so busy running,
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.760]   you don't have time to think about yourself.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:24.080]   Like this is how the Christian life is meant to be run
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.480]   in abundance, that we would not be hedging our bets
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.960]   and trying to control our lives and figure it out.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.760]   We are fixing our eyes on Jesus,
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.680]   running the race he has set before us,
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.920]   and throwing off the sin and the burden
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.840]   because why would we carry that around
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.680]   when we've got a race to run?
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.320]   If you're wondering why you're still stuck in a sin
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.600]   10 years later, go sign up to lead five-year-olds
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.920]   or do something that will change your life
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.200]   and make you less selfish.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.640]   Care about someone other than yourself.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.360]   And all of a sudden you don't have time to sin
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.720]   because you're thinking about the people
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.800]   that are looking up to you.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.960]   You're thinking about the people
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.400]   that wanna be just like you.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.600]   And there's something in the spirit
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.320]   that happens through us and to us.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.960]   When we say, okay, I'll try that, I'll do that,
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.200]   that's not comfortable for me.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.960]   Help God, help.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:26.320]   This is what I know.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:34.180]   Every single thing that I know to be true of God
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:38.080]   is not because I was blessed enough to get to go to seminary
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.640]   and because I know my Bible.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:43.080]   Everything that I know to be true of God
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.420]   is because I have stepped out on the water
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.900]   where feet may fail and He has held.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:52.320]   And that is what the life is He has called you to.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.800]   Now, some of you are sitting there thinking, this is great.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:01.680]   I'll risk, I don't think it's that big a deal.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.080]   What do you want me to do?
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.560]   And I'll do it.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.560]   I'm gonna suggest that probably the thing you want to do
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.200]   is probably not the thing God's gonna call you to do.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:15.680]   So I'm actually gonna take this great sales pitch
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.680]   and like kill it because in my experience,
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:28.440]   He keeps, I keep saying,
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.760]   I keep saying I wanna go that way.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.400]   And He keeps saying, you're going this way.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:42.240]   And because of that, I am at Him.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:51.720]   But where else am I gonna go?
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:59.280]   This is the Christian life,
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:04.280]   not finding your perfect career and calling,
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:09.120]   but finding ways to die to yourself every single day
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.600]   and pick up your cross and follow Him
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.760]   no matter where He says go.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:18.160]   And that is the story of how you know Jesus if you do,
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.760]   because somebody picked up their cross and followed Jesus
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.040]   and said, I'm gonna tell this neighbor about God.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.840]   I'm gonna go to a new city.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.880]   I am going to go to a new country.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.160]   I am going to take the gospel somewhere
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.640]   because someone said, I'll go where I don't wanna go.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.840]   You know Jesus.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:41.560]   Because somebody had a conversation
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:45.800]   that they didn't probably want to have, you know Jesus.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:50.960]   It is down this road that is more unknown.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.160]   It's wilderness.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.480]   It's like, let me tell you how I've felt
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.560]   most of my Christian life.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.800]   I have a hatchet, I'm in the jungle and God says go.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.080]   And I'm like, there's no road.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.240]   He's like, go.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.200]   I'm like, you want me just to start chopping?
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.400]   And He's like, yes, chop and I'll be right with you.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.800]   And I'll tell you when to go left
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.120]   and I'll tell you when to go right.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.480]   And you'll know what to do, not because you're smart,
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.640]   but because I'm good and I'll walk right beside you.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.200]   I will be a lamp unto your feet.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.440]   I will show you.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.040]   I will show you where to go.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:25.880]   And what does that look like?
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.240]   Everybody's going, what does that look like?
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.440]   Does God speak?
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.760]   I know, everybody wants to know.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.360]   That's like the trick question
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.240]   or I'm gonna get in trouble now on the internet.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.080]   All right.
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:42.960]   I can't tell you, but when I stand in front of choices,
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.320]   there's a sense of surrender in me
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.520]   that I will go wherever you call me to go.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.600]   And when that has been true of my heart,
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.760]   not just of my mouth, but of my heart,
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.920]   I've known what to do.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:03.120]   Surrender always, always is necessary to hear from God.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:10.280]   You will never ever know what to do in your life
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.880]   as long as you are placing bets on six numbers,
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.600]   eight numbers, four numbers,
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.360]   until you place everything into one square.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.960]   You will always feel like, why don't I hear from God?
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.400]   Why do I struggle with my sin?
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.600]   Why can't I change?
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.560]   You will be stuck in your sin forever.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.360]   It's the simplest, truest thing I could ever say on earth.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:37.240]   Surrender to Jesus, all of it.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.760]   Seek ye first the kingdom of God
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.120]   and all these other things will be added to you.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:46.840]   It's a story of the whole book that we read
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.120]   and that we preach about.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:54.920]   Abraham, all of the history of all of those imperfect people
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:59.060]   that said, God, yes, Esther, I will obey you.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:04.740]   And then this one, and this one isn't fun.
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.560]   Risk will always confuse the people around you.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:14.460]   Can you imagine what everyone was thinking about David
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.180]   when he takes off all the armor
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.060]   and runs out with his little slingshot?
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.220]   Can you imagine how much everyone was just laughing
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.560]   and entertained by this?
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.040]   This was hysterical to them.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.240]   They were making fun of him.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.740]   The Philistines, everybody's taunting him.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.780]   They're not even fighting
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:31.460]   because they're literally just having a ball
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.560]   watching this little boy with a slingshot.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:40.880]   And yet the world has a way of doing things
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.620]   that is successful.
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.140]   It makes sense to the world.
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:45.460]   It makes sense to us.
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.540]   It makes sense, this is how you do it.
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.780]   This is what you do.
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:53.780]   But when God calls you to risk something,
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.460]   to do something for him,
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:00.460]   in my experience, it has never made any sense at all.
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.740]   It has never felt like, wow, I have what I need.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.280]   I know what to do, let's go.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.060]   It has felt like, are you sure?
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.060]   Because this is gonna be embarrassing.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.420]   This feels scary.
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.080]   I don't think that this could possibly be right.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.060]   I remember when we started If Gathering,
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.220]   it's an organization I lead,
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.020]   and we hosted our first big event.
[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.460]   And I took away the ticket price,
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.580]   and I said, I think we're supposed to do pay what you can.
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.380]   We didn't have an investor.
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.660]   We didn't have any money ourselves.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:32.500]   We had nothing.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.040]   And so my husband and everyone that loves me
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.060]   and everyone that was involved was like, Jenny, no.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:42.980]   Like, we will have to file bankruptcy,
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.380]   and this will end before you even start.
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.380]   And guys, there are times to listen
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.780]   to the voices of godly people.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.740]   Believe me, I have listened to my husband
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.300]   many, many times that he has said no,
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.260]   and I've said, you're probably right.
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:59.160]   But in this instant, there was something in me
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.020]   that I just knew this is what we were supposed to do,
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.620]   and it didn't make sense.
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.460]   It cost $300,000 to host our first event.
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.500]   It went out to the world.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:12.500]   There were 1,200 local events that happened in that time.
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.020]   We raised $315,000
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:19.140]   with $10 bets.
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.100]   I mean, not bets, donations.
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.580]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:23.420]   Kinda was.
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.500]   $10 donations.
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:32.020]   There are times God will ask you to do something
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.020]   that feels just silly.
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.540]   And largely, let me tell you where that has been in my life.
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.100]   It has been in my neighborhood.
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.580]   It has been with my friends.
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.180]   It has been with people that I have a relationship with.
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:47.980]   Those have been scarier risks than the big things.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.700]   Having a conversation with somebody
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.140]   that doesn't know God,
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:54.260]   that has been a harder thing to accomplish
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.100]   than the big things that I'm more sure of
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.620]   that I feel like God is really saying to me,
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.420]   even though there's more on the line.
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:04.020]   But here's what I picture with all of you,
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:08.780]   is if we're growing up, if we're running our race,
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.820]   if we're accomplishing what God has for us,
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.820]   if we're taking our little rocks and slingshots,
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.260]   here's what happens.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.020]   God gets the glory.
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.620]   And that's the story that he's writing.
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.500]   That's a story he wants to be a part of,
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.100]   is a story where he gets the glory,
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.540]   where a little boy takes five stones
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:30.340]   and it only takes one and knocks down the giant.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:33.700]   These are the stories that God wants to build through us.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:38.620]   And what if, what if Jesus comes back in your lifetime?
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:45.220]   What if that is the plan?
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:50.220]   And so today, when I'm, specifically yesterday,
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.980]   when I'm a little anxious about coming back and going,
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:57.660]   "Okay, Lord, like you're gonna have to almost recall me,
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.900]   "recommission me to do this,
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.720]   "because I've really liked living in this little space.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.360]   "Like I want you to send me back out
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:10.020]   "if you want me back out there, but I'm good if I stay."
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:15.080]   When I'm praying that, when I'm wrestling with him,
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.100]   this is what I picture.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.140]   I picture 3,000 of you walking out of these doors
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.700]   and doing one small thing that scares the crud out of you
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:27.300]   for the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:32.100]   And that that domino falls into the lives of other people
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.240]   and it hits their lives and you don't ever know
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.020]   or even see it, but you obeyed God.
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:41.060]   You obeyed God and you did what he called you to do.
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.980]   And that fell into the life of someone else.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:44.560]   And that fell into the life of more people.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.300]   And that fell into the life of more people.
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.180]   And that fell into the life of more people.
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.660]   All of a sudden, I'm not speaking to 3,000 people.
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.680]   I'm speaking to hundreds of thousands of people
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.260]   because you walk out those doors, you go to your towns
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.220]   and you do the little acts of obedience
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.280]   that scare you to death.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.980]   God moves on earth.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:06.020]   How the world changes.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:10.220]   Small, risky, godly steps of obedience.
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:14.020]   If you are following him and it feels comfortable,
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.480]   I promise you there is more.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:20.580]   And here's the great news.
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:26.040]   God honoring risky obedience,
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.900]   it isn't actually risky at all.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.780]   It's not risky at all.
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.380]   The way that this game is played, Stephen was telling me,
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:37.460]   is that the most common bet is to put it all on a number.
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.400]   You put it on one number.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.780]   20 is the most popular number.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:44.980]   So here's hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:46.900]   We're gonna just put it all on 20.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.980]   Because here's the thing.
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:54.460]   We know how this ends.
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:58.280]   If you knew the number, if you knew it, without a doubt,
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.200]   if you knew the number is 20, I know it,
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.580]   it is going to be 20, what would you put in on that?
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.420]   What would you do?
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:09.940]   How would you play if you were certain
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:13.960]   with 100% accuracy that the number would be 20
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.180]   when this thing rolls, what would you do?
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.860]   What would you put in on it?
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:19.920]   You'd put everything.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.300]   Guys, you're playing small and there's something in me
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.340]   that has this feeling like it's gonna really matter
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:28.720]   that you not do that.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:33.940]   That it's going to matter that you spend your lives
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:37.500]   not fancy, not doing big things for God,
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:40.140]   but doing obedient things that God calls you to.
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:43.340]   And sometimes it will be big and mostly it will be small,
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.940]   but it will be big.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:51.340]   Because when I look at the things God has done
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.620]   that in the world's eyes are big,
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.420]   they were built with a million small little relationships
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:01.140]   and conversations and scary moments and acts of obedience.
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:04.800]   And for most of you and most of us,
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.260]   we're not gonna see till heaven
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.460]   how all of that was the big stuff, but it is the big stuff.
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:12.960]   It is the big stuff.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:19.020]   The most common way God has led me and nudged me
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:25.420]   is ideas that pop in my head that I wouldn't have thought of
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:29.360]   that I'd be too selfish to even think of that.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.860]   But they'll bother me, they'll be in my head
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.860]   and I'll think to myself, okay,
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:38.540]   maybe that matters, maybe that's something
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:39.900]   I'm supposed to do.
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:43.060]   And I've learned to listen to those ideas and those thoughts
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.340]   and to act on them because what's happened
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.700]   when I've done that is ridiculous things.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.420]   It's like the little rocks, you're like,
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.220]   this isn't a big deal, it's just a little rock.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:53.620]   It's what I do when I'm taking care of the sheep.
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.820]   But he set his nation free.
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:04.140]   So who are we to decide what we should do for God?
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:09.060]   See, God has a plan, he has a story,
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.700]   it's written before time and prepared in advance
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:12.880]   for us to walk in.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:19.500]   I think of the parable about the field
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:25.500]   when Jesus is giving the analogy of
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:29.140]   who wouldn't buy the field, push all the money in
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.340]   when they see that there's a treasure
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.800]   worth more than the land.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.340]   They spend whatever they have to spend to get the land
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.100]   and everybody will say, you're crazy to pay that,
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:42.720]   to spend that, to risk that, to lose that,
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.860]   to not control that, to go all in with God,
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:46.780]   that feels crazy.
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:47.860]   You may never get married
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.860]   because you're too strong of a girl.
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:54.240]   You may never have the perfect life
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.380]   that you're trying to build.
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:58.320]   You may lose that if you're called overseas.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.760]   Think of my friend, Katie Davis.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.100]   Many of you know her story.
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:08.140]   And she moved overseas as a 20 year old
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:09.260]   and just never came back.
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.860]   She moved to Uganda and started bringing girls in
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:15.680]   off the streets and loving them and they became a family.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:20.260]   And the story of Katie is what inspired
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.220]   every single thing that I am currently doing in my life,
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:28.220]   namely our family, adoption,
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.900]   gift gathering, getting over myself
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.340]   and doing what he's called me to do
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.580]   and going down the road he's called me to go on
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.820]   instead of the road that I would want to
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.520]   or that would be more comfortable.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:46.820]   See, risk is contagious.
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:52.380]   Because you do things, you start doing things
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.740]   that don't make sense, that aren't comfortable.
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:59.060]   And everybody cocks their head and wonders
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.540]   what the heck you're doing.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:05.140]   But deep down, we all really hope there's more to live for
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:09.460]   than just a perfect little life that's all figured out.
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.900]   And there is.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.460]   There is.
[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.900]   We're not crazy.
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:20.300]   We're not crazy.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.100]   The number's 20, I don't know.
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.080]   The number's 20.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:27.780]   Whatever it is, it's happening, it's real, it's not myth.
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:28.900]   Heaven's coming.
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:29.940]   It's not pretend.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:33.980]   It's not a Maple Leaf story you heard in sixth grade.
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:36.500]   It's real, it's happening, it's coming.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.860]   And anything and everything that we do
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:44.700]   in the name of our God and in light of that story
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:45.820]   will be worth it.
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.540]   We are not fools.
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:51.460]   So what is it?
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.040]   And let me tell you what we're gonna do.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.900]   We're gonna actually pray really quickly together.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:00.460]   And we're gonna ask God together if you're up for this.
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.940]   And I would encourage you, even if you're not,
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:08.540]   to pray these two simple prayers.
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.900]   They're gonna play for just a minute.
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.300]   Number one, you're gonna say,
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.400]   "God, what do you want me to know?
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.080]   "What do you want me to know?"
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.800]   And then number two, "God, what do you want me to do?"
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:27.560]   And we're just gonna be quiet for a minute.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.720]   And as you ask God those questions,
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:34.360]   I am praying that he will bring ideas to your mind.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:39.320]   So God, we are your people and we are here.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.460]   And we wanna spend our lives well.
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:43.680]   Show us how.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.960]   God, what do you want us to know?
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.480]   And what do you want us to do?
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.060]   (gentle music)
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.640]   (gentle music)
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.220]   (gentle music)
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.800]   (gentle music)
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.380]   (gentle music)
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.960]   (gentle music)
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.540]   (gentle music)
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:09.120]   (gentle music)
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.700]   (gentle music)
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:16.280]   (gentle music)
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:21.360]   (gentle music)
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:25.820]   (gentle music)
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:30.280]   (gentle music)
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:34.860]   (gentle music)
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.440]   (gentle music)
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.900]   (gentle music)
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:47.940]   (gentle music)
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:51.940]   (gentle music)
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.980]   (gentle music)
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:59.980]   (gentle music)
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:03.980]   (gentle music)
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.980]   (gentle music)
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:18.360]   We have maybe a year, maybe 50 more, maybe more,
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:24.520]   years on this earth.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:32.860]   And I always have this image in my mind
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.440]   of getting to heaven and seeing Jesus
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.900]   and being out of breath.
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:42.640]   Just having run every ounce of the life
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:43.860]   that he had planned for me.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.860]   And Father, I pray for every person
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.400]   that can hear my voice right now, God,
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.560]   that they would want the same thing.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:55.400]   That they would want you more than their life to work out.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:46:01.320]   That they would want you more than money or fame or success.
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:06.700]   Or success or comfort or power or relationships on earth.
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:11.520]   God, that they would want you most.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:16.440]   And God, that you would, through their lives,
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.280]   write stories that go on into eternity.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:23.100]   That you would, through these little ideas
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:26.320]   and seeds of thoughts, God, would you multiply them.
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:32.940]   And would that ripple, God, touch generations.
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:37.320]   And Jesus, we don't know when you're coming back,
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.640]   but if it is soon, help us not waste the time.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.900]   God, build an urgency in our souls
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:49.180]   that causes us to risk everything in this life for you.
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:53.520]   No matter what you say, God, that we would do it.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:00.100]   Help us not miss any good work
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:04.140]   that you have prepared in advance for us to do.
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:08.360]   Not for our glory ever, because what a waste,
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.440]   but for your name and your glory that will go on forever.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.760]   We wanna be a part of that.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.020]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:17.080]   you
