 [Music]

2
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,820
 >> Hey, good evening, Porch. How we doing tonight? Good? Yeah?

3
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,820
 Hey, welcome. It's so good to have you here with us this Tuesday.

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,960
 Whether you've been here many times, like Josiah said, or this is your first time,

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,200
 I mean it when I say this, thanks for trusting us with your Tuesday.

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,500
 Genuinely, we're really glad you're here. Any Spring Breakers in the room tonight?

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,660
 Anybody in town because you're on Spring Break? Welcome.

8
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,460
 We're glad to have you here. So grateful that you would come and you would hang out with us on Tuesday.

9
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,760
 We not only have some friends joining us here, but we've got some friends joining us from around the nation.

10
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,960
 Special shout out to our Porch Live locations and specifically Porch Live Indy, Porch Live Des Moines, and Atlanta.

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,900
 Thanks for jumping in. We're so glad you're here and we're grateful as well that you would give us your Tuesdays.

12
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,360
 Hey, if you had known me in grade school, I'm ashamed to admit it,

13
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,020
 but you would have known that I was pretty average when it came to most athletic sports.

14
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,460
 I'm not too proud. I can stand up here and say that.

15
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,760
 Like I wasn't the tallest kid, the strongest kid, the fastest kid, but I got by.

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,100
 Like I made do with what I had. Like I had a can-do attitude and I was full of determination and grit.

17
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,760
 Like I was willing to put in the work that other people wouldn't. I would show up early and stay late.

18
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,860
 Like I was that kid. I was full of hustle. I had a motor, which helped me a lot.

19
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:46,260
 Like I got by on that for the longest time. And then I made it to high school.

20
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:52,260
 And what I found whenever I turned 14 years old and I walked through the doors of the high school football locker room is

21
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,960
 that I was no longer in the company of my well-meaning 14-year-old peers.

22
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:03,860
 No, now I was in the company of grown men. You know, where I had peach fuzz, they had full beards.

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:10,860
 Where I was just kind of cresting out of puberty, you know, like they were with deep bass voices.

24
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,760
 Where I was getting dropped off, they were driving themselves.

25
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,960
 Like there was a vast difference when I made my way into high school.

26
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:26,060
 And as a result of all of those differences, the athletic chasm between where I was and where they were was very noticeable.

27
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:32,760
 Like it was hard to realize that all of my can-do attitude and determination, it wasn't sufficient.

28
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:40,260
 Like I showed up and what I realized is that I couldn't just get by on the merits of my effort any longer.

29
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,760
 Instead, I realized why they say we're separating the men from the boys.

30
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,060
 Because I was the boy in the locker room. They were all so much more athletic, so much better than I was.

31
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,960
 And if the performance on the field wasn't enough to demonstrate just how wide the difference was between us,

32
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:03,360
 we went into PR testing, which really silenced any doubt that they were far more athletic than I was.

33
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,460
 If you don't know what PR testing is, PR testing is personal record testing within a variety of skills.

34
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:15,360
 And so we would do things like we would run the 400, we would run the 40, we would do the bench press,

35
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,160
 we would squat and see who could push the most weight. And I'm not lying to you.

36
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,360
 If there was any doubt that I was far behind the rest of the competition, all doubts were silenced.

37
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:33,360
 Because when we came out of the PR testing period of our group, what I learned was that within my skill position,

38
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:41,560
 I tested last in every single skill except for one, which was height.

39
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,560
 Which I really don't have much control over, you know, like I just kind of got whatever my mom and dad gave me.

40
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,860
 So I can't take credit for that one, even though I still do take great ownership of it today.

41
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,860
 But I had absolutely nothing to brag about. I was weaker than everybody else.

42
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:02,260
 I was absolutely exposed because of these PR days. I was weaker, slower, smaller than everyone.

43
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:08,460
 I just wasn't as good at them as them. And yet those PR days, they were the very best thing for me.

44
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:15,460
 Why would I say that? Because it showed me just how far behind everyone else I was.

45
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,660
 Even though it brought me face to face with the reality of how weak I was,

46
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,860
 it brought me to the point where I was finally honest with myself.

47
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,560
 I wasn't as good. Not only that, I was far worse than I thought.

48
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:35,760
 And yet that could change. I could grow. Like I had been united to something so much bigger than me.

49
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,460
 I had joined this new team. And because I was a part of something bigger than me,

50
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,260
 I could be better than I was previously.

51
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:53,060
 I could actually make progress on all the areas that I felt so incredibly weak within.

52
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,160
 Why do I tell you that? Because in the same way, when you meet God,

53
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,460
 you do become a part of something so much bigger than you.

54
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:09,960
 And as a result, you do grow and you do get better than you were previously.

55
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,060
 This is what happens when we enter into, not the high school locker room, but the family of God.

56
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,460
 When we place our faith in Jesus and we step into his kingdom and we unite alongside his people,

57
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:28,560
 what happens is he takes us where we are and he moves us along the way and makes us more like his son.

58
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,760
 And that's what I want to talk to you about tonight.

59
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:36,660
 But what we need to know is that while that seems like such a great course of progress,

60
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:48,060
 that progress comes by way of exposure. Where I PR tested and found out just how bad I was.

61
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,560
 The Apostle John is going to take us through a spiritual PR test tonight.

62
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,460
 He's going to expose before us. Not only that we're bad, but man,

63
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:02,360
 we're much worse than we think and yet we have great hope because we can grow

64
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,060
 and we can get better as a result of our union to Christ.

65
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,260
 So if you have a Bible with you, you can pull it out and you can turn with me to 1 John.

66
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,760
 That's where we're going to be. 1 John chapter 1. And as you're doing so,

67
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,960
 here's what you need to know. John is going to just simply tell us,

68
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,460
 "Hey, as we walk with God and we experience his greatness,

69
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,360
 you are going to come face to face with your weakness. Today and tomorrow

70
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,060
 and the day after that you're going to go through one spiritual PR test after the other.

71
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,160
 And yet the point of it all is to, yes, expose your deficiencies,

72
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,560
 but also help you come to grips with the fact that you can become more like Christ.

73
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,560
 There is hope on the other side. And so as we come to this,

74
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,260
 as we come to 1 John, as we come to his letter,

75
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,660
 what he's going to say is that before he pushes us to consider ourselves,

76
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,960
 how we need to grow, how we need to get better, what it looks like to become more like Christ,

77
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,060
 what we need to do is we need to consider God. That's where this whole thing starts.

78
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,260
 That's where he begins. So 1 John chapter 1 starting in verse 5,

79
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:04,160
 it says this, it says, "This is the message we have heard from him." Him talking about Jesus.

80
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
 "This is the message we've heard from Jesus.

81
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:15,760
 And we proclaim to you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all."

82
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,960
 You see, what John wants us to know is that when we see God clearly,

83
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,460
 we will see ourselves clearly in comparison.

84
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:29,060
 And John would know how to actually tell us about God because John, he was an apostle of Jesus.

85
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,560
 He was also arguably Jesus's best friend,

86
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,660
 which means if you have a best friend in the room, they're closer to you than anyone.

87
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:43,660
 John is the guy that's closer to Jesus, closer to the son of God than anybody else.

88
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,860
 And tonight he's going to look at us and say, "Hey, there's a way to get close to him."

89
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,960
 But it doesn't start first and foremost with you. Before we understand the nature of man,

90
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,160
 we need to understand the nature of God. Because Christianity,

91
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:04,160
 spoiler alert, is not fundamentally about you. It's about him.

92
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,360
 And so that's what he says. He says, in essence, what A.W. Tozer says,

93
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,860
 which is what comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us.

94
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:21,260
 So what comes to mind for John? John tells us, he says, "When I think about God,

95
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:28,160
 what I think about is that he is light."

96
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:35,960
 Which is interesting because John is the only New Testament author to make any kind of assertion about the divine nature of God.

97
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,960
 Like other authors, they describe his attributes and his activity.

98
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:47,960
 And yet John, he actually defines the very essence of God's being, which is really audacious.

99
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:53,660
 Like most people, when they're talking about their friends, describe them.

100
00:08:53,660 --> 00:09:03,760
 John defines him. So for instance, I say Bob is kind. Not Bob is kindness.

101
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,460
 That would be odd. I say Bob is wise, not Bob is wisdom.

102
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,460
 And yet John is sitting here tonight and he's looking at us and he's saying,

103
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,660
 it's not just that God is kind or God is patient or God is peaceful.

104
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:26,560
 What you need to know is that God is light. He's defining him for us.

105
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,060
 Great. Thanks, John. Like God is light. What does that even mean?

106
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,660
 Like what is that sort of assertion?

107
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,060
 What are you trying to help me understand when you're saying God is light?

108
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,960
 And what we need to know is that by saying this,

109
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,060
 he's employing an idea that over the course of the entire scripture,

110
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,260
 this idea of light is symbolic of a couple of important things.

111
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,660
 We see it pop up over 200 times in the entirety of the Bible from beginning to end.

112
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,860
 And more often than not, it's representative of two things.

113
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:59,760
 The first thing that light is representative of is that light is representative of truth or reality.

114
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,560
 Light is representative of truth or reality. It reveals what's actually there.

115
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,060
 Whereas darkness in contrast to truth is representative of error.

116
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:17,760
 So Psalm 119 verse 105, it says, your word is a lamp to my feet.

117
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,560
 It's a light to my path. And if you jump down to verse 130,

118
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,860
 it says the unfolding of your words, it gives light.

119
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:32,160
 It imparts understanding to the simple. You see, when John says that God is light,

120
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,660
 he wants to know that God brings understanding to us.

121
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:42,360
 He offers clarity. He makes sense of what's confusing.

122
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,660
 And what's fascinating is we talk about light in the same way.

123
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,260
 Like if I came up to you and I was like, hey, can you shed some light on that situation for me?

124
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,360
 What would I be asking? I'd be asking, can you help me understand what's going on there?

125
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,260
 Can you reveal to me what the circumstances of that situation are in specific?

126
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,260
 That's what we say whenever we say, hey, can you shed some light?

127
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:09,160
 So to just help us understand, he is saying God is trying to shed light on your situation.

128
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,360
 He's trying to help you come into the understanding of what's true about you.

129
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,660
 That when we see him, we will see ourselves.

130
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,460
 That's the first thing. Light is representative of reality, but it's also representative of purity.

131
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,060
 That's the second thing. Or moral uprightness, virtue.

132
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,360
 Like that's what it represents. Sin in contrast to light,

133
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,460
 it's representative of evil. God is pure. Sin is evil.

134
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:40,760
 Ephesians chapter 5, verses 8 through 9, it says, "For at one time you were darkness, you were evil.

135
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,060
 You were enemies of God. You were darkness. But now you're light in the Lord.

136
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,560
 Therefore walk as children of light." Not children of darkness, not enemies of God any longer,

137
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,560
 but walk as children of light. "For the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true."

138
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,460
 Those things which are pure. Like by describing God as light,

139
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:09,160
 John is saying it is God's essential nature to radiate truth and purity.

140
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:15,560
 You see, God, he's similar to the sun.

141
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:25,660
 In that the sun, it makes clear to us, it reveals what is actually seen,

142
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,660
 but it not only brings revelation, it not only shows us what's there,

143
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,160
 it also warms us, comforts us, makes us feel good.

144
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,860
 This is how God operates as light. He helps us to find revelation,

145
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:48,860
 but then also a sense of deep satisfaction.

146
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,660
 And so what we know is that this means that God is perfect, but there's no flaw in him.

147
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,160
 There's no flaw in him intellectually because he's truth,

148
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,260
 and there's no flaw in him morally because he's pure.

149
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,660
 And that's what John goes on to say. He says, "In him, in God, is no darkness at all.

150
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,460
 If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness,

151
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,760
 we lie and we don't practice the truth." What's he getting at?

152
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,860
 First point for the night, that God and sin do not mix.

153
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,760
 They don't mix. Like by definition, darkness is the absence of light.

154
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,560
 Yes. Yeah, they don't mix. They're opposite in nature.

155
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,860
 So if I illustrated it for you like this, maybe it would be helpful.

156
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:36,260
 If we turned off all the lights in this room, behave yourselves.

157
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,960
 We would find that most everything is concealed.

158
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:48,960
 That in this moment, we struggle to make sense of anything around us.

159
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:56,060
 Most everything. It's hard to understand. It's confusing to grasp.

160
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,460
 Sure, we might be able to make the faint silhouette of certain people around us,

161
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:05,460
 but there's no definition. There's no clarity in the room whatsoever.

162
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:12,960
 And yet if we turn the lights back on, clarity returns.

163
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,060
 Error abates. Definition is given.

164
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,260
 We can see everything all at once.

165
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,460
 But here's what we illustrate by doing that.

166
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,460
 When darkness is in the room, light is absent.

167
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,260
 But when light shows up, what happens to darkness?

168
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,960
 It disappears. It leaves. It's gone.

169
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,660
 They cannot be in the same place at the same time.

170
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,160
 So it is with God and sin. Like God is light, sin is darkness.

171
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,660
 They are by essence opposed to each other.

172
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,360
 Now you may hear that and think to yourself,

173
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,060
 "Kylin, thanks so much for telling me that God is the source of all moral beauty

174
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,760
 and truth in the world,

175
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,160
 and he cannot coincide with that that is the source of all error and evil in the world.

176
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,360
 Thank you." As if I didn't know that already.

177
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,160
 That seems so obvious.

178
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,160
 But here's what I would say. I talk to young adults all the time.

179
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,160
 And they come and they visit and they ask me the question,

180
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,960
 "Man, I feel distant from God. He feels hard to find.

181
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,760
 It's as if my spirituality is dried up.

182
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,460
 The things around me, they're arid. It's a desert out here, bro.

183
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,760
 Why? Why is this the case? What do I need to do?"

184
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,660
 And the first thing I often do is I'll just ask them the question,

185
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,060
 "Hey, where's sin in your life?" Which feels really invasive.

186
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,560
 But it also feels unnecessarily obvious. Are you serious, bro?

187
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
 Like that's all it is? Like where's sin in my life?

188
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,860
 That's the thing you're going to ask me? You just want to know like,

189
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,060
 "Oh, where am I entertaining sin? Where's the devil's playground in my life?"

190
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,960
 Like that's all it is. And yet here's what we know.

191
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:59,260
 If God and sin do not mix, then where sin is present, God will be absent.

192
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:05,360
 You see, the quickest way to sever your nearness to God is to anchor yourself in sin.

193
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,760
 Like John's literally saying, "Hey, if you claim to have fellowship with God,

194
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:17,860
 relationship to God, and yet you walk in the dark,

195
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,760
 you're lying to yourself because they can't coexist.

196
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,060
 They're opposite in nature." And so as we think through this,

197
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,760
 like I've said this to this room before,

198
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,860
 but all of life is either a drawing near or a drifting away from God.

199
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,660
 All of it, like everything you do, everything you think, all the words you speak,

200
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:42,060
 whatever video you watch, everything you do, the food you eat,

201
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:49,160
 the way you sit right now, it's also very consequential.

202
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,060
 All of life, everything you do, it will either lead you close to God

203
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,660
 or will distance you from Him. The Scriptures tell us that we are to do all things,

204
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,760
 whether you eat, drink, do all things to the glory of God. All.

205
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,860
 Like there's no exception to that. It's everything we do, everything we are,

206
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,060
 it is for the purposes of His glory. He's worthy.

207
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,060
 And so we live our lives to that end. And the beauty of it is,

208
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:21,860
 is we give God glory. We get rolled up and we get brought into the deep joy that He offers.

209
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:29,360
 But when we don't do that, when we indulge our sin, we scratch whatever our itch is,

210
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:35,660
 we satisfy our carnal cravings, what we find is we go distant.

211
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:45,860
 We lose our nearness. We divorce our proximity. We get away from Him.

212
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,660
 This can feel really alarming. Yeah?

213
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,160
 Well, okay, so you're telling me that if I'm walking in darkness,

214
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,260
 I can't have fellowship with Him? Because we all know if we're honest,

215
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,160
 if we're sitting here tonight, we could be honest with each other.

216
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,560
 We could say, yeah, I'm not morally perfect.

217
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,560
 Like you don't even have to look over the course of however many years of life I have.

218
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,760
 You can look at today. Like you can just take a look at whatever I've seen,

219
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,960
 whatever I've said, whatever I've done. Like you can just take a look,

220
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,760
 roll the recording and you can realize, man, I'm not perfect at all.

221
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,660
 I've done some stuff today that's actually in fact bad.

222
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:25,760
 I'm the guy on stage that can admit to that. Like we would be traumatized

223
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,160
 if we actually rolled on this screen behind me the things that we have done

224
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:36,860
 or said or thought today. So roll the tape guys. Let's show them.

225
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,160
 How does that make you feel? Nervous, right?

226
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,960
 Because you know it. You know it's true. You're like, don't put it up there.

227
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,460
 Don't show that message. Don't show the history.

228
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:55,360
 Don't play the video. Like we know we've done stuff.

229
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,960
 Because in our heart of hearts, we know. We're dark.

230
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:13,160
 The stain does go so very deep. And it leaves us anxious, worried, confused.

231
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:19,960
 Ashamed. What do we do with that?

232
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,460
 Like does that mean because those things are there because of what John is saying?

233
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,260
 We can't have fellowship with God? Like are you here tonight?

234
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:33,060
 And because of your saying, your imperfection, that bad in your life?

235
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,260
 Does it mean fellowship with him is impossible?

236
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,560
 No, because that's what he goes on to say in verse 7.

237
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,060
 He says, but if we walk in the light as he is in the light,

238
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:49,160
 if we walk with God in his essence, the essence of his being, truth and purity,

239
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,660
 if we walk in his light as he is in the light,

240
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,060
 we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus, his son,

241
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:59,360
 cleanses us from all sin. So question, is perfection the expectation of verse 7?

242
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,560
 Like is John expecting you to be perfect? No, absolutely not.

243
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,360
 He says that the blood of Jesus cleanses you.

244
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,660
 Why do you need the blood of Jesus? To cleanse you,

245
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,660
 forgive you of your sins, to take that which is bad and get rid of it.

246
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,360
 To take that which makes you dead and get rid of it.

247
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,260
 Like that's what he's pointing to. He's saying,

248
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,060
 hey, Jesus has come to do two things.

249
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,460
 He's come to forgive you and cleanse you,

250
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,760
 what he will say later on and right now what he says.

251
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,360
 And so therefore walk with him and be cleansed by him.

252
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,460
 He gives you two verbs.

253
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,960
 And what's interesting about those verbs in the Greek is they're both in the present tense,

254
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,960
 which means it's a continuous state of being.

255
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,860
 That it's not a one and done sort of situation,

256
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:47,560
 that we walk with Jesus continually. And as we walk with him,

257
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:56,160
 we're cleansed. We're made whole. So straight out of college,

258
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,460
 I worked for a nutritional life sciences company,

259
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,060
 a company that focused on like health and wellness. And it was awesome.

260
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:07,260
 It was great. I'll get into an elaborate story about it another time because it deserves to be told.

261
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,960
 And yet in the company's corporate gym, which was amazing,

262
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,460
 there was a dry sauna. I got really into dry sauna.

263
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,460
 Okay, like I turned into a dry sauna bathing buffoon.

264
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,760
 Like I loved it, man. I just,

265
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,860
 I had read up on the details of how this thing would be beneficial for my health.

266
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,960
 And so I bought into it. I got all the way in thinking like, man,

267
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,360
 this is going to be beneficial for my health.

268
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,360
 And so every single day while I worked at that company,

269
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,960
 I would dry sauna after I worked out.

270
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,560
 And the reason for it is because I knew one of the benefits it offered is that as I sit in this sauna

271
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:49,860
 and I gently heat myself, I'm detoxified. And all of the impurities,

272
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,960
 they just sweat away. Why do I tell you that?

273
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,360
 Because I'm not trying to convert you to dry sauna bathing.

274
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,560
 Like you can go cold plunge if you want to. Not sure what the effects of that are.

275
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,660
 But what I do know is this is how Jesus works with us.

276
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:12,660
 As we prolong our time with him, what happens is you walk with him.

277
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:19,260
 He detoxifies you. He rids you of any impurities.

278
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,960
 Because it's a continual process. It's in a present sort of tense,

279
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,060
 the way that John is describing it right here in verse 7,

280
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,760
 which is good news to us because it means as we come to God,

281
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,460
 we're not meant to be perfect. We're meant to be perfected. Perfected.

282
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,160
 Like some of you have walked in tonight and you're like, man, I'm not perfect.

283
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:47,560
 I know that. And so what you're doing is you're trying so hard to measure up.

284
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,460
 You're trying to earn heaven's smile.

285
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,260
 You're trying to do whatever is possible so that way God will actually tolerate you.

286
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,060
 Like God, you don't even have to accept me, but will you just tolerate me?

287
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,760
 Will you let me in through the pearly gates?

288
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,660
 Like you're doing everything in your power to earn your way in.

289
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,960
 You're trying to be perfect for him. And yet this scripture is saying,

290
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,760
 no, you don't come to him and be perfect.

291
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,160
 You come to him and he makes you perfect in time.

292
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,360
 Like you walk with him and he cleanses you along the way.

293
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,060
 You don't have to clean yourself up. That's his job.

294
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,560
 This is what it says in verse 7. As we go to verse 8, John keeps going.

295
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,960
 He says, if we say we have no sin, if we claim to be perfect,

296
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,860
 we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.

297
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:37,460
 If God is light and we walk with him, then the result should be honesty about ourselves.

298
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,260
 Like you don't walk with him and say, there's no sin in me.

299
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,060
 We all just admitted there is. And so we sit in and we say, there's no sin in me,

300
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:49,660
 God, I'm perfect. I'm doing the best I can. I am in fact good.

301
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:54,160
 We are actually walking in denial. We're deceiving ourselves.

302
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,360
 John's saying don't do that. No, be honest about yourself.

303
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,660
 Like just like PR testing in high school gave me a baseline upon which I can evaluate myself against my peers.

304
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:07,360
 It is the presence of God that gives you a baseline upon which you can evaluate your good deeds.

305
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,860
 Just so you know, they don't measure up. Your goodness will never measure up.

306
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,760
 And yet because we have him as a sound comparison point

307
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,360
 and we can register the fact that he is light, we know we're not.

308
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:31,360
 And here's what's fascinating. Two-thirds of the United States agrees with this statement.

309
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,060
 Across religious lines, like across socioeconomic background,

310
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:41,260
 two-thirds, over 66% of Americans, they're saying, I know I'm sinful.

311
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,460
 Even at least a little bit. Like we're willing to say, I know something's not right in me,

312
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,560
 but here's the problem with that. The problem isn't that we're unwilling to admit that we're sinful.

313
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:54,160
 We're unwilling to admit just how sinful we are.

314
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,660
 Like that's the issue. Like we know, hey, generally, yeah, man,

315
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,460
 I'm not the best person, but who is, you know?

316
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,460
 Like everybody's got some kind of some kind of skeleton in the closet,

317
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,760
 something that they've done wrong, and yet we must come to grips not with our general admittance of sin,

318
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:18,060
 but our specific admittance of sin. Because the issue here that John is saying is there is no relationship

319
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:24,460
 where there is no honesty. There's no relationship where there is no honesty.

320
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,860
 When I was in college, I had a pickup truck, and I loved this thing.

321
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,760
 It was my truck from high school. It was my truck given to me at 16 years old.

322
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,360
 I took it to college with me. It was amazing. Everything a kid from East Texas would want,

323
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:44,060
 six-inch lift, GMC Sierra Z71, you know, like when I took my prom date out in high school,

324
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,660
 like I had a stepstool to help her get up into the truck, you know, I was a true gentleman.

325
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,160
 And so I take this thing to college, and I love it. I'm driving down the road,

326
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,360
 and yet it started to behave oddly. Like I would drive it down the road,

327
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,560
 and I would hit a bump, and the whole thing would just like start shaking around, you know?

328
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,460
 It was like, I don't really know why it's doing that,

329
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,460
 but I would just slowly decompress the brake, and things would come back to a calm,

330
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:10,460
 and I would just drive along my way until I hit another bump, start shaking along,

331
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:15,160
 and then I would slowly decompress the brake, bring things back to a pause, and carry on my way.

332
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:20,560
 I did this for a really long time until one day I'm driving to class.

333
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:28,460
 Had an 8 a.m., up early, making my way to school, and as I'm blitzing through a red light,

334
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:38,460
 I need to turn left. And as I turn the steering wheel left, the truck keeps barreling on forward.

335
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,960
 Which was a problem, because it revealed to me that there was an issue.

336
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,060
 One that had gone unchecked for a very long time.

337
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:53,260
 And you want to know what the issue was? To my mechanic's horror,

338
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:59,660
 the steering column of the vehicle had been detached from the front axle,

339
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:04,460
 meaning that it didn't control the tires anymore. I was disconnected from the truck.

340
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:09,260
 Any movement I made did not have any impact on where I was now going.

341
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:16,660
 Why do I tell you that? Because I did not consider the seriousness of my problem.

342
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:26,060
 And it put me into a dire situation. I wonder how many of us do this ourselves.

343
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:34,260
 Like we see problems pop up in our life. Little alarms, little oddities, things that are strange and out there.

344
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:42,260
 And yet we don't address them. We just kind of ignore them, decompress the break until they subside and go away.

345
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:47,660
 We carry on about until eventually we find ourselves in dire straits.

346
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:52,260
 The reason for this is because we've deceived ourselves.

347
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,860
 We have admitted our sin generally, but we've not admitted our sin specifically.

348
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,160
 We know we're not perfect, but rather than calling our sin out for what it is

349
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,560
 and addressing the seriousness of the problem, we just kind of veil it in cagey language.

350
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,760
 We say things like, "I struggle with lust. I'm wrestling with pride. I'm frustrated with that person.

351
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:19,960
 I gossip sometimes, but who doesn't?" And as we do this, we belittle the magnitude of our issue.

352
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:26,460
 And in so doing, we amplify the seriousness with which the consequence will come to bear.

353
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:35,560
 But what we see in John's letter is that if we confess our sins, he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins

354
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:41,660
 and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Like he tells us, "Hey, rather than concealing the truth about yourself,

355
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,860
 confess it. Get it out. Like don't hide it any longer.

356
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:55,960
 Like it's only when we drag ourselves into the truth of God's light that our darkness can finally be fixed."

357
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:05,560
 Listen to me on this, especially those of you that have been walking with Jesus for a long time.

358
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:14,460
 Spiritual maturity, according to the apostle John, is not seeing less of your sin.

359
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:21,360
 It's seeing more of it. True spiritual maturity is not seeing less of your sin.

360
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,760
 It's seeing more of it. Why? Why can we extract that conclusion from his letter?

361
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:35,060
 Because as we walk in the light, greater exposure comes to bear upon our sin.

362
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:42,060
 And if we are, in fact, as close to Jesus as we say we are, spiritually mature, we're boys, we hang out,

363
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:49,160
 I'm so close to him, then that light should become all the more exposing.

364
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,760
 It should only come to increase in our life.

365
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,160
 And thus, any pride and any egotism should decrease in the face of that radiance.

366
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:10,060
 This is what we know. That we confess our sins, and Jesus, in his kindness,

367
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:16,560
 he rightly leads us to a place of forgiveness and cleansing.

368
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,260
 So why do we confess? What does that word even mean?

369
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:26,060
 Well, in the Greek, the word confession means to say the same thing as another person.

370
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,160
 It means to agree with someone else.

371
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,060
 So when we confess our sins to God, we're agreeing with God about ourselves.

372
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,960
 Like God knows how dark you are. There's nothing you've done that's hidden from him.

373
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,560
 No matter how hard you try, no matter how committed you are to taking that thing to the grave.

374
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,260
 And friends, I've been there in that place. He knows anyways.

375
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:53,260
 He sees all of it exactly as it is. And he just wants us to come to him and be honest.

376
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,560
 God, you're light and I'm not. You're good and I'm not. You're right and I'm not, God.

377
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:04,760
 I am not right on my own. I cannot save myself. And yet, you can.

378
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,160
 That's why the first step of every believer, anybody that walks with Jesus,

379
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:18,560
 the first step is what? It's confession. It's what theologians call judicial forgiveness.

380
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,160
 That in a moment, the minute I confess my sins,

381
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,460
 I receive the gift of God from Jesus and I declare him as Lord.

382
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:31,760
 The minute that's done, all of my sin, past and present and future, it's forgiven forever.

383
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,760
 And finally, it's never coming back. It will never separate you from the love of God.

384
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,860
 But we don't just confess for that. We confess continually.

385
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:45,060
 Why? Because there's also an element to confession that is relational.

386
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:49,960
 There's judicial forgiveness and relational forgiveness.

387
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:56,160
 Relational forgiveness says, hey, your position as a son or daughter of God will never change.

388
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,560
 That's never going anywhere. But your proximity, it can change.

389
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:11,460
 Your nearness to him, your fellowship with him. It can be hurt if you do hurt him.

390
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,160
 No different than if a son sins against his parent.

391
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,360
 There's going to be strain in the relationship.

392
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:24,760
 So too is that the case for us with God when we sin against him.

393
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,560
 And so why do we confess? Because it keeps us close.

394
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,460
 That's what it does. John says God is faithful.

395
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,860
 He's just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all our righteousness.

396
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,660
 When we confess, there are two results. I'm going to go through these quick.

397
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:43,460
 The first result is forgiveness. Like when we confess to God, forgiveness, it floods over all of our wrongs.

398
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,060
 Guilt is removed. That's the first thing you need to know.

399
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,660
 When I come to God and I confess, my guilt is taken away.

400
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,060
 That nagging pain you have in the pit of your stomach because you know you did something wrong.

401
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,960
 When you come to God and you confess it, that's taken away.

402
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,460
 Forgiveness floods over that thing, but you have to address it specifically.

403
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:06,260
 So it's similar to like spam in your inbox. One day, I just got sick of it, man.

404
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,560
 You know, it's like every time I went to my inbox, it was just spam everywhere.

405
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,160
 I don't even know how I didn't subscribe to this stuff.

406
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,960
 But you know what I did have to do? I had to unsubscribe to that stuff.

407
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,460
 And I could not unsubscribe by just checking it all at once and throwing it in the trash because it would come back.

408
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:35,960
 The way that I unsubscribed was by addressing them one by one by one by one by confessing them individually.

409
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,460
 And as I did, what happened to my inbox? It was emptied.

410
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:48,860
 Of any impurity, all the guilt of those spam emails, they were gone.

411
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,160
 We get forgiveness. The second thing we get is we get cleansing.

412
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,660
 Like when we confess our sins, guilt is removed. Yes. And joy is restored.

413
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,160
 Like that's what we know in Psalm 51, 7 through 8.

414
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:05,360
 It says, "Purge me with hyssop and I'll be clean. Wash me and I'll be whiter than snow.

415
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:12,260
 Let me hear joy and gladness with the bones, God, that you've broken. Rejoice."

416
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:19,060
 And you see, when you confess, you remove the bad, all of your guilt, and you receive the good.

417
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:24,760
 All of God's joy. Is not that good reason to do this?

418
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:31,560
 Is not that good reason to come to God, the one who knows it all anyways, and just own it, admit it, and seek his forgiveness?

419
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,060
 That way you might experience a ridding of that guilt and a restoring of that joy.

420
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,060
 That's the offer on the table for you.

421
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,060
 So how do you know that God will do it? Because it says that he's faithful and just to do it.

422
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:47,860
 Like he's faithful. This is the gospel. The gospel is that Jesus Christ has come to do this for you.

423
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:54,560
 That if you believed in him, he has taken your sin away. No longer is there any condemnation for you.

424
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,360
 He's faithful. He'll take it. But he's also just. Like he's just to do it.

425
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,760
 Like what we know is that he's already borne the consequence of our sin and death.

426
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:10,860
 So now, for those that have placed their faith in him, it is characteristically impossible for God to revisit his wrath.

427
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,960
 That's amazing news! Like it's characteristically impossible.

428
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,860
 Not just circumstantially impossible, not just subjectively impossible.

429
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:25,560
 No, it is characteristically impossible. God would have to go against his character to revisit his wrath on you.

430
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:31,160
 But he cannot do it. Why? Because he's faithful. Because God's own character won't let him do it.

431
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:36,760
 Jesus Christ has stepped into your place. The wages of sin is death.

432
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,360
 So he absorbed it. He took the hit. He died your death. He served your sentence.

433
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:46,860
 That way you can go free and have no worry of this ever at all.

434
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:53,860
 1 John 2, 1 and 2 says, "My little children, I'm writing these things to you so that you may not sin.

435
00:35:53,860 --> 00:36:02,160
 But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous."

436
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,560
 The righteous. He's right on your behalf.

437
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,160
 He is the propitiation for sins and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole world.

438
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,460
 John is telling us, hey, there is no sin too dark for the light of the world.

439
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,260
 No sin at all that's too dark.

440
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,660
 And the way we know that is through these two words that he uses to describe Jesus.

441
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,560
 Jesus is both an advocate for sinners and he's an atonement for sins.

442
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,660
 That's what the word propitiation means. It means atonement.

443
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:37,460
 He's an advocate. That is you one day come before God and all your life is written in record before him.

444
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,960
 Every wrong, Jesus will stand on this. He will stand beside you and he will advocate for and say,

445
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:49,360
 "I paid for it all." Any condemnation, any consequence upon them.

446
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,560
 I took that. They get to go free.

447
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:59,660
 And the good news of that is God the Father says, "I know that's why I sent you.

448
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:04,960
 Because I love them and I want them for myself. My wrath, my judgment, my justice.

449
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,860
 It needed to be satisfied. And so you did. You satisfied it.

450
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,260
 What's with the wrath of God? Does that freak anybody out in here?

451
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,260
 Like the judgment of God? Oh my God, like no, please.

452
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:22,560
 Like what is with that? Well, think about it.

453
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,660
 Anything wrong or evil or errant in the world, anything criminal,

454
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:32,760
 anything that harms or hurts those you love, what do you want?

455
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:40,560
 You want justice. You want judgment. Wrongs deserved to be righted.

456
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:48,560
 They deserve to be disciplined. God looks upon his world, his people,

457
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,260
 and he sees how they've been hurt, how we have hurt each other.

458
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:58,960
 And in his holiness, he knows I must, I must be just in the face of this evil.

459
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:05,860
 But I love them too much to judge them myself. I will send my son to stand in on their behalf.

460
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:10,560
 He will take the hit that they might go free.

461
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,860
 Jesus is your advocate. Do you know him?

462
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:21,060
 Because apart from him, you have no advocate and you will stand in consequence.

463
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,060
 He's your atonement. But apart from him,

464
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:29,060
 there is no amount of good work or atoning nature you can bring to God.

465
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:34,660
 Nothing will satisfy. But he's made a way. He's provided an out.

466
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:40,860
 That's why Romans 8 34 says, "Therefore who is to condemn?"

467
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:45,160
 Who's to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died.

468
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,460
 And more than that, who was raised? He was vindicated.

469
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:53,960
 Like who goes into a prison cell and then the door swings open that is not declared innocent?

470
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,460
 Who has not paid the sentence in full? Jesus has done that.

471
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,360
 That's why the resurrection is so significant.

472
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,860
 It's not just that it promises you eternal life in the future.

473
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:09,460
 It promises you eternal life, forgiveness of sins right now, today, here this evening, if you know him.

474
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:15,460
 That's such good news that he not only died, he was raised, who is at the right hand of God.

475
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:21,160
 He's ascended back to the throne of majesty, who indeed is now interceding for us.

476
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,560
 He's standing on our behalf and he's saying, "God, I've taken care of it.

477
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,860
 I love them like you love them. There's no reason that they should be separated from us any longer.

478
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:33,360
 They get to come home. They don't have to just spend eternity in heaven.

479
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,160
 They get to spend eternity with me, with you, with us.

480
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,960
 The fount of all joy, the goodness of God, it's available to us.

481
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,660
 And yes, it is in the future, but is available tonight.

482
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:56,760
 So when all of the evidence is compiled, Jesus the righteous, when we couldn't be, he died where we should have.

483
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:02,860
 He knows the penalty against us. It was so very great, but he paid it.

484
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:15,860
 George, why then would you walk in a darkness that you no longer have to?

485
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:21,260
 Why then would you not remove any obstacle from being close to him?

486
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,260
 If all it means is confession, confession.

487
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:31,360
 If you're here and you don't know Jesus, the first step of confession is just to confess to God.

488
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,160
 It's to look to the Lord and say, search me, oh God, know my heart.

489
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:41,560
 Try me and know my thoughts. See if there's any grievous way in me and lead me in the way everlasting, God.

490
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:49,060
 Like in the face of your beauty, let me see my depravity.

491
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:55,860
 And then let me find Jesus and follow him where he goes.

492
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:01,760
 If you do know him tonight, then maybe it's confessing to someone else.

493
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,560
 James 5 16 says, therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another that you may be healed.

494
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,560
 The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it's working.

495
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:17,060
 Again, you confess to God and you get forgiveness and you get joy.

496
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:21,760
 But healing comes to the prayers of your brothers and sisters.

497
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,660
 Why wouldn't you pray for those that are in need?

498
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:29,860
 Why wouldn't you confess to those that have need?

499
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,660
 Why would you not come and say, hey, I've sinned against God.

500
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,060
 I've done these things. I've looked at this.

501
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,060
 I've thought these thoughts. I've said these words.

502
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:44,660
 I'm telling you, would you pray for me? Would you help me find healing?

503
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:50,860
 And it's through their prayer that God's power comes to bear.

504
00:41:50,860 --> 00:42:01,860
 Your joy is restored. And you feel life within your bones again.

505
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:06,460
 Maybe it's confessing to someone you've wronged.

506
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:11,760
 Looking to someone and saying, I envy you. I've been embittered towards you.

507
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,160
 I've abused you. I've manipulated you. I've taken advantage of you.

508
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,460
 I've spoken these words behind your back.

509
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:23,460
 I don't know what it is, but confessing to those that we've wronged,

510
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,260
 knowing that in so doing, we've marred the image of God in people,

511
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,060
 we've indignified them.

512
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:41,960
 Jesus Christ has come to give us all the dignity and humanity that our sin has stripped from us.

513
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,060
 Where do you feel guilt?

514
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:49,960
 God will prick that conscience and it's there that you should take action.

515
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:54,660
 Friends, if we want to walk closely with God,

516
00:42:54,660 --> 00:43:00,260
 the reason why we've taken a week off from our series,

517
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,460
 and we've decided to just visit about, hey, there is one thing,

518
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:08,560
 the series we've been working through, one thing to seek that brings everything else into focus.

519
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,760
 What is it? It's proximity to God.

520
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,460
 We've taken a week off to look at you and say,

521
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,860
 there are reasons we feel a lack of closeness and proximity to him.

522
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,960
 And the reason for that so often is sin.

523
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,260
 And so friend, if you want to be close to him tonight, remove any obstacle in your way.

524
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:34,860
 Expose yourself. There's no darkness too great to keep us from God.

525
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:39,760
 And the reason we can take heart and hope in knowing that is there was no darkness too great

526
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:52,560
 to keep him from you. You see Jesus, the light of the world.

527
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,860
 He stepped into our darkness becoming like us in it.

528
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:07,860
 That we the dark of this world might step into his light and become like him forever.

529
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:17,160
 Do you want to come close? Then confess. The light shines in the darkness.

530
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:27,960
 The darkness cannot overcome it. Step into the light. Be cleaned. And be alone no longer.

531
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:35,660
 Let me pray for us. Father, I know that this message can sit heavy.

532
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:43,460
 It can preach heavy. But Lord, I pray before we walk out these doors

533
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,660
 and we move back into whatever it is is awaiting us in life, God,

534
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:52,760
 we would know freedom is available tonight.

535
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,860
 For those that don't know you, freedom is the offer.

536
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:02,460
 Freedom is the gift of God in the person of Jesus that any that would cry out to him and say,

537
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,760
 you're my Lord, you're my light. I want to follow you forever.

538
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:12,860
 I want to I want to receive your gift, your grace in my life.

539
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:18,960
 I want to lay down my sins knowing that you've paid for them and receive God your forgiveness.

540
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,660
 That freedom is available for you, that person, whoever it is that prays that prayer right now,

541
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:29,460
 that you can be freer tonight than you've ever felt.

542
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,360
 But freedom is not only available for those that do not know Jesus.

543
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,360
 Freedom is available for those that do know Jesus.

544
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:41,460
 The freest person in the room is the person that has absolutely nothing to hide.

545
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,660
 And so God, would we come to you and would we conceal these things no longer?

546
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:57,560
 But would we expose ourselves? And God, would we receive the gift of walking free forever?

547
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:03,460
 We love you. We respond to you now. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen.

548
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,160
 Hey, you can stand to your feet if you would and join us here in worship.

549
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,560
 Here's what I just want to put on the table before you sneak out.

550
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:16,060
 These evenings build to this moment right here.

551
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:19,360
 Not because we're trying to get an emotional stir.

552
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:27,760
 We're trying to fabricate a moment, but because God has led us this last hour to this moment now.

553
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:36,660
 What do you sense the Spirit of God in this room, in your life, prompting you to right now?

554
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:41,760
 Listen, we've got a team down front. They would love to pray with you.

555
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,560
 They would love to process with you.

556
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:48,960
 What you need to know about them as we talk about this idea of confession is there's nothing you could ever come say to us

557
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,960
 that would surprise us, that would ever catch us off guard.

558
00:46:52,960 --> 00:47:05,360
 I've heard some crazy things and yet the good news of it is that Jesus Christ has paid in full for it all.

559
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:11,560
 So why would you not come receive his grace for whatever it is?

560
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,760
 They're here to pray, to process. You can stay where you are.

561
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,560
 You can seek the Lord, confess to him, but this moment is now yours.

562
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,560
 He's in the room. How will you respond, Porch?

563
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,620
 you
