1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 (soft music)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:29,220
 - Summer's here, baby.

3
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,420
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,740
 Come on.

5
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,360
 Here's what that means tonight.

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,820
 That means that there are a bunch of young adults

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,260
 gathered downtown Dallas, as well as Fort Worth,

8
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,300
 as well as Houston.

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,940
 I think we may have a picture of the downtown.

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,780
 Do you guys have that?

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,740
 I don't know if you guys got that or not.

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,740
 If you do, throw it up.

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,620
 If not, no worries.

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,740
 We'll show you guys later.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,860
 But anyways, bunch of young adults gathered at Gillies

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,780
 or the South Side Ballroom tonight.

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,840
 I love summer.

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,900
 You guys like summer?

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,740
 (audience cheering)

20
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,820
 They would love summer.

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,420
 I like to get outside.

22
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,940
 I like to get by the lake, hang out with the family.

23
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,100
 I love to grill, which reminds me,

24
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,540
 today I was reminded of this story that I was,

25
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,980
 a group of us, it was kind of a guy's weekend,

26
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,700
 and we were hanging at my buddy's lake house.

27
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,620
 And it's kind of like a lake cabin, if you will.

28
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,820
 And we were grilling.

29
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,100
 So a bunch of dudes, we went to Central Market,

30
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,620
 got the good steaks, the fat filet.

31
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,960
 And my buddy who was grilling was pretty excited about it.

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,900
 The rest of us got in the truck and we were driving around,

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,420
 just kind of looking for animals and stuff.

34
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,300
 And we came back excited to feast.

35
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,140
 And as we get out of the car, we hear him yelling,

36
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,160
 which is not normal 'cause he's kind of like

37
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,620
 an excitable guy, you know,

38
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,940
 and I think he's just happy about the filets.

39
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,280
 And as I walk around out back,

40
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,740
 it is this scene that I will never forget, okay?

41
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,860
 He has set his entire deck ablaze.

42
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,180
 I mean, bonfire that is moving toward his house.

43
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,620
 Here's what happened, is as he was cooking these filets,

44
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,260
 he didn't realize that the lighter fluid

45
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,180
 was under the charcoal grill, like too close to the,

46
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,740
 like just sitting under there,

47
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,780
 getting hot and getting hot and getting hot.

48
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,700
 And as he saw it kind of ballooning, kind of expanding,

49
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,740
 he tried to grab it with some tongs and it just liquefied.

50
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,620
 And so this like liquid fire ran all over his deck

51
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,660
 and started seeping in between the deck,

52
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,060
 burning it from underneath,

53
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,820
 which all that's underneath are these dry pine needles.

54
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,300
 So it's like this perfect storm of a fire, right?

55
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,640
 And so this is going on.

56
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,260
 So we kind of walk back, we see this fire,

57
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,520
 but then the comedy of errors ensue

58
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,800
 because what happens is he goes to get the water hose,

59
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,180
 but it's one of those water hoses

60
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,600
 that kind of wraps up in this box, if you will,

61
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,420
 that's kind of connected to this other little hose.

62
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,520
 He picks up the box and it rips away from the wall.

63
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,020
 And so he's left with this four foot water hose,

64
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,220
 15 foot from the bonfire as it's approaching his house.

65
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,200
 And so he turns on the water full blast

66
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,660
 and he's trying to perfectly arch the stream.

67
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,380
 And so this is what I walk up on.

68
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,660
 He's like, "Help, help!"

69
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,940
 I'm like, "What do you want me to do?"

70
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,340
 And so a bunch of us, right, the rest of us guys,

71
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,100
 we don't know what to do, there's no water hose now.

72
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,740
 And so we run inside and we just start filling up

73
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,980
 Dickie's cups with water.

74
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,220
 Like one guy's just out there spitting on it.

75
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,360
 You know, we got nothing, right?

76
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,980
 We're trying to put out this fire.

77
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,540
 And so what we end up, you know,

78
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,540
 eventually like he kind of saturates the deck

79
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,940
 and it runs in between.

80
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,760
 And to this day, he has this huge burnt mark.

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,820
 He hadn't replaced the deck,

82
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,900
 just this huge burnt mark that we saw.

83
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,780
 But the next day we woke up

84
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,460
 and we're just kind of praising God that we're still alive

85
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,020
 and the house is still there.

86
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,260
 And we're talking about it, we're laughing about it now.

87
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,160
 And at least the rest of us were.

88
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,860
 And I go in his cabinet to get a Coke

89
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,740
 and right there is a fire extinguisher.

90
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,260
 (congregation laughing)

91
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,420
 I said, hey bro, you know you got

92
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,940
 a fire extinguisher in here?

93
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,620
 And he goes, no.

94
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,800
 And I go, yeah, look right here,

95
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,940
 like seven feet from the fire.

96
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,460
 I'm like, it's right here.

97
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,340
 He goes, oh man, I forgot I had that.

98
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,660
 He's like, man, that would have been

99
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,600
 really useful yesterday, right?

100
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,380
 That would have been something

101
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,860
 that I wish I would have remembered yesterday.

102
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,520
 And he said, it's something I hope I never had to use.

103
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,240
 And as I think about us tonight,

104
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,260
 I think that's how we view our faith.

105
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,180
 Like we think, hey, I've trusted in Christ

106
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,140
 and so now I'm a Christian, which means I have a faith

107
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,700
 in the one true God, I hope I never have to use it.

108
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,340
 And then what happens when we face the fires of this life

109
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,520
 is it's not the first thing we're reaching for

110
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,540
 because we haven't been using it in every day.

111
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,940
 We forgot we had it, we might as well not.

112
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,500
 Let me go one step further with you.

113
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
 What if you don't?

114
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,940
 Like if you have a faith that you don't use,

115
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,280
 do you really have a faith?

116
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,940
 If you have a faith that you don't live according to

117
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,220
 and make decisions around and it doesn't impact

118
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,080
 the direction of your life, what you do, where you go,

119
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,200
 how you hang out, how you talk, everything about your life,

120
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,160
 is it really a faith?

121
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,000
 Or is it something, like maybe you view it as kind of

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,700
 fire insurance, if you will, a get out of hell free card

123
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,400
 or something that you kind of filed away that,

124
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,520
 hey, one day, hopefully that will get me into heaven,

125
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,320
 but I'm not gonna use it here.

126
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,720
 And let me tell you something.

127
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,420
 Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, America is full of

128
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,420
 lukewarm Christianity and the Bible does not speak fondly

129
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,580
 of lukewarm Christians.

130
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,740
 It's a weird time to live, 2016, where you can kind of

131
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,700
 be cool and kind of be a Christian at the same time.

132
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,980
 You look backwards, that's never really been the case.

133
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,340
 And looking backwards, Christians always stood out.

134
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,220
 They always stood out against culture.

135
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,060
 They always stood out by the way they loved.

136
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,700
 They were not the cool kids.

137
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,820
 And then all of a sudden, it's 2016,

138
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,920
 and we've just kind of blended in.

139
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:22,100
 And I'm asking the question, is a lukewarm Christian

140
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,060
 any sort of Christian?

141
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,240
 And that's something we have to wrestle with this evening.

142
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,940
 And so we're in this series, BC,

143
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,560
 which just is the Old Testament.

144
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,160
 It stands for before Christ.

145
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,160
 I'm sorry, BC, which is pre-2016,

146
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,500
 pre-Jesus coming up on the scene.

147
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,260
 And we're looking at these stories of the Old Testament.

148
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:54,200
 And we're moving toward Christ and we're looking at people

149
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,080
 who have a faith that also point to Jesus.

150
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
 And so tonight I'm gonna be in Daniel chapter three,

151
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,740
 if you wanna turn there.

152
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,660
 Daniel chapter three, and we're asking this question,

153
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,360
 what does real faith look like?

154
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,120
 And so we're gonna look at the lives of three men,

155
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,560
 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

156
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,600
 If you've heard this story,

157
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,200
 if you had it read to you as a child,

158
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,600
 if you have heard it here before

159
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,280
 or have heard it taught before,

160
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,720
 it's an incredible story, a historical account.

161
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,640
 And as we move through it, we're gonna look at

162
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,680
 how a real faith is counter-cultural,

163
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,000
 how a real faith is uncompromising,

164
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,720
 and how a real faith makes converts of our critics.

165
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,160
 And so I'll set this up.

166
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,200
 There's this king, his name is Nebuchadnezzar,

167
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,560
 historical account, history does not deny this man.

168
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,560
 Everybody, historians, any credible historian would say,

169
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,240
 Nebuchadnezzar was absolutely a king, he was a real king.

170
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,960
 He's this narcissistic guy.

171
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,160
 He's the king of the Babylonian empire.

172
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,120
 He has conquered much of the known world.

173
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,040
 He's moved into Jerusalem.

174
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,160
 He's burned down the temple and he's taken captives.

175
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,640
 But this guy is smart, okay?

176
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,280
 Like if you look at the Assyrian king, the Assyrian empire,

177
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,040
 they were really great at skinning people alive.

178
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,080
 They had perfected it.

179
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,040
 If you look at the Persian empire,

180
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,480
 they were great at crucifying people.

181
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,480
 The Babylonian empire is great at brainwashing people

182
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,160
 and mixing them into their culture.

183
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,400
 That's what they're really good at, so that's what he does.

184
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,000
 As he moves into Jerusalem, he takes God's people

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,800
 and he takes some captive, but those who are royal

186
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,760
 or those who are in the upper class,

187
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,120
 those people that everyone else looked up to,

188
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,240
 he gives them jobs and he feeds them well.

189
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,600
 And he bribes them with food and a great life.

190
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,240
 He says, "Hey, come and work for me

191
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,000
 "and you can have a great life."

192
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,360
 I liken this guy to President Snow,

193
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,900
 if you've seen "The Hunger Games."

194
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,360
 That's kind of what I think of

195
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,720
 as I think of King Nebuchadnezzar.

196
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,880
 And so he begins to brainwash his captives.

197
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,920
 And one way that he does this

198
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,860
 is he just changes the world they know,

199
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,800
 starting with their names.

200
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,080
 And so he takes these three men who were the upper class,

201
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,520
 they were nobility, and he gives them,

202
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,840
 he offers them a good life.

203
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,440
 And he takes Hananiah, which means God is gracious,

204
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,240
 and changes his name to Shadrach,

205
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,120
 which means commander of the moon god.

206
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,920
 He takes Mishael, which means who is like God,

207
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,880
 and he changes his name to Meshach,

208
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,040
 which means who is like the moon god.

209
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,020
 He takes Azariah, which means God has helped,

210
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,700
 and he changes his name to Abednego,

211
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,640
 which means servant of the god Nebu.

212
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:43,980
 And in Daniel 3, what he does to these 4,600 Jews

213
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,100
 who are mixed into the Babylonian empire

214
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,580
 is he builds this gold statue 90 feet tall.

215
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,180
 That's as tall as an eight-story building.

216
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,460
 If you've seen an eight-story building,

217
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,480
 90 feet tall, nine feet wide,

218
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,060
 and he's going to offer,

219
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,740
 he's going to present it to the kingdom.

220
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,780
 And so his people come forward, and he says,

221
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,840
 "Hey, whenever you hear the music,

222
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,440
 "guys, listen, whenever you hear the music,

223
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,480
 "I want you to bow down and worship the statue.

224
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,240
 "And by the way, if you don't, we're gonna cook you a lot.

225
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,280
 "So just do it."

226
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,880
 And everybody's like, "Oh, okay."

227
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,980
 You got it.

228
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,520
 And that's where it picks up.

229
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,300
 Verse eight, chapter three of Daniel, verse eight.

230
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,900
 At this time, some astrologers came forward

231
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,940
 and denounced the Jews.

232
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,100
 So there's these Babylonian astrologers.

233
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,180
 They don't like the Jews.

234
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,820
 And they said to King Nebuchadnezzar,

235
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,780
 "May the king live forever.

236
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,920
 "Your majesty has issued a decree

237
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,520
 "that everyone who hears the sound of the horn,

238
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,100
 "flute, zither, lyre, heart, pipe,

239
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,460
 "and all kinds of music must fall down

240
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,300
 "and worship the image of gold,

241
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,280
 "and that whoever does not fall down in worship

242
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,680
 "will be thrown into the blazing furnace.

243
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,160
 "But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs

244
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,320
 "of the province of Babylon.

245
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,280
 "You've given them great jobs, king.

246
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,760
 "These guys, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

247
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,500
 "they pay no attention to you, your majesty.

248
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,340
 "They neither serve your gods nor worship

249
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,960
 "the image of gold you have set up.

250
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,440
 "Furious with rage now, Nebuchadnezzar summons

251
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,140
 "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

252
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,300
 "So these men were brought before the king.

253
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,820
 "And Nebuchadnezzar said to them,"

254
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,620
 Is it true, guys?

255
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,760
 Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego,

256
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,260
 "that you do not serve my gods

257
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,520
 "or worship the image of gold I have set up?"

258
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,680
 Now listen, come on, guys, okay?

259
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,340
 Let's just kind of go through the exercise.

260
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,060
 Whenever you hear the horn, the flute, the zither, lyre,

261
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,300
 the harp, the pipe, or all kinds of music,

262
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,360
 if you're ready to fall down

263
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,300
 and worship the image I made, very good.

264
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,180
 But if you do not worship it,

265
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,580
 you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace.

266
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,840
 Then what god will you have,

267
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,920
 what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?

268
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,200
 And so Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, these three men,

269
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,700
 they stand in contrast to their culture.

270
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,960
 They stand out.

271
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,180
 They stand out because of what they are unwilling to do.

272
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,600
 In the midst of 4,600 of their peers,

273
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,940
 all of them face down on the ground,

274
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,980
 these men standing upright saying,

275
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,640
 "We can't bow to a foreign god."

276
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,980
 Now how are we doing tonight?

277
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:27,180
 How are we doing it, going against the culture

278
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,340
 or going with the culture?

279
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,820
 You guys heard this song, "Panda"?

280
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,120
 Let me sing it for you if you haven't.

281
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,220
 ♪ Panda, panda, panda, panda, panda, panda, panda ♪

282
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,700
 ♪ Panda, panda, panda ♪

283
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,620
 Anybody heard that?

284
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,080
 Like I tweeted out the other day,

285
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,720
 like this is the stupidest song I've ever heard.

286
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,020
 And so people started responding.

287
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,860
 They were like, I was like,

288
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,100
 "How is this on the radio?"

289
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,060
 And they're like, "Well, it's a great beat, man.

290
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,100
 "It's a great beat, fun to dance to."

291
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,940
 So I was like, "Cool, man."

292
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,500
 So I just Googled it.

293
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,040
 Like I'm just like, "Hey, I wanna read the lyrics.

294
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,140
 "I was gonna read them to you tonight."

295
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,980
 I can't.

296
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,020
 I can't.

297
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,860
 I would lose all credibility with you immediately.

298
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,780
 I mean wicked, vile things.

299
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,580
 Okay, let's go get coked out of our mind,

300
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,740
 then let's go sell coke,

301
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,060
 and then let's go abuse women for sport.

302
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,380
 And if you're not in, you're a little girl.

303
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,060
 That's as clean as I can make it.

304
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,300
 But let's go, man.

305
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,180
 Hey, hear the music, bow down.

306
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,140
 If I'm like, move, you know.

307
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,740
 Panda, it was a great beat.

308
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,920
 How we doing, guys?

309
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,800
 How we doing is standing against the current of our culture.

310
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,280
 My first point is real faith is counter-cultural.

311
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,800
 Real faith is counter-cultural.

312
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,960
 I don't know if you've ever heard to be in the world,

313
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,360
 but not of the world.

314
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,520
 It's usually said by someone who is of the world.

315
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,920
 And I know Jesus said it, but here's the deal.

316
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,960
 You're in the world, that part's taken care of.

317
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,760
 You don't have to try to be in the world.

318
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,840
 You're in the world.

319
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,440
 You can't not be in the world.

320
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,760
 You're in the world, and you're called not to be

321
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,440
 of the world, to stand apart from the world.

322
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,680
 And so as followers of the one true God,

323
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,440
 our decision should cause us to stand out,

324
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,360
 both what we choose to do and what we choose not to do.

325
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,320
 And it seems to me that everybody's trying to stand out

326
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,360
 that no one stands out.

327
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,240
 Like when I go to the mall today,

328
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,520
 I'm just looking at every, like the,

329
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,680
 the thugs and the preps and the hipsters,

330
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,600
 and everybody just looks crazy.

331
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,320
 And it's like, they all kind of mix in,

332
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,760
 and everybody's trying not to be normal.

333
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,880
 So everyone's normal.

334
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,200
 It's like the cool thing is to rebel against culture

335
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,320
 so there are no rebels, except those that say,

336
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,480
 I won't do that.

337
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,880
 I'm not in.

338
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,240
 I don't need to be different to stand out.

339
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,760
 I'm gonna embrace God.

340
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,800
 I'm gonna embrace my own self.

341
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,760
 I'm gonna embrace God.

342
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,960
 I'm gonna let this faith mark my life.

343
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,800
 We stand out as Christ followers wherever we go.

344
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,400
 It's like, it's like in,

345
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:25,320
 in order, disorder stands out.

346
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,000
 Like in morality, immorality stands out.

347
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,800
 When you're in class and the teacher

348
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,720
 is holding everyone's attention,

349
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,720
 that one guy who keeps acting out, who keeps acting up,

350
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,320
 he's disrupting the entire class,

351
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,960
 bringing attention to himself, he stands out.

352
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,920
 But when everyone is acting out,

353
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,960
 the one person who is sitting still,

354
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,280
 doing what they should do, they stand out.

355
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,400
 They're the rebel.

356
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,240
 They're the counter-cultural one.

357
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,800
 In immorality, morality stands out.

358
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,960
 In a world that rejects God,

359
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,320
 a person who fully embraces God stands out.

360
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,920
 Not someone with a fire extinguisher in the closet,

361
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,760
 but someone who is using it on the daily.

362
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:15,360
 Standing out, it's not always fun.

363
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,080
 You face persecution.

364
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,400
 Listen, you probably won't be burned alive.

365
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,760
 Probably, I mean, that probably is not gonna,

366
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,560
 but persecute, you might spend Friday night alone.

367
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,960
 And for some of you, that's just as terrifying.

368
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,520
 And I'm just here tonight to tell you, man,

369
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,920
 it's gonna be okay if you're alone Friday night.

370
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,200
 It's gonna be all right.

371
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,720
 It seems to me that Christians today

372
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,040
 are the most unwilling to stand out

373
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,400
 by their choices than they've ever been.

374
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,760
 We're scared of being identified as weird.

375
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,440
 In fact, there's a group of sociologists

376
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,680
 that did a study in a book called

377
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,480
 "Premarital Sex in America."

378
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,720
 And they studied two groups of men,

379
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,320
 unmarried, college-educated, ages 18 to 23.

380
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,440
 All the men were unmarried, college-educated,

381
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,640
 ages 18 to 23, but they classified them in two groups.

382
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,640
 The first groups were men who were raised in a family

383
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,480
 where they said it's completely okay

384
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,160
 to have sex outside of marriage.

385
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,600
 It's completely okay to have premarital sex.

386
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,000
 Like that was just the theology,

387
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,400
 the world that they were raised in.

388
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,880
 And the second group of men were raised in a family,

389
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,640
 a Christian family, Judeo-Christian values

390
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,600
 that say sex outside of marriage is wrong.

391
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,760
 And so of the first group of men who were raised

392
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,480
 in a family where they said there is nothing wrong

393
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,200
 with sex outside of marriage, amongst that demographic,

394
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,200
 23% of them were virgins, only 23%.

395
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,160
 But in group two, those that were raised

396
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,160
 in the family that sex outside of marriage is wrong,

397
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,840
 20% were virgin.

398
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,640
 Less.

399
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,240
 And here's what's going on,

400
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,720
 because they said, hey, we have a belief,

401
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,440
 but our belief does not influence our behavior.

402
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,760
 We have a theology, but we've been more influenced

403
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
 by culture.

404
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,720
 We're not counter-cultural,

405
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,600
 we're more cultural than culture is.

406
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,240
 My belief doesn't influence what I do.

407
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,040
 No, I say I believe this, but I do what I want.

408
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,440
 It's not a real belief.

409
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,760
 It's a fake belief.

410
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,680
 It's not a real belief.

411
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,360
 They said they had convictions,

412
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,880
 but when things got hot, they went the way of culture.

413
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,040
 And this is my story.

414
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,280
 I was raised in the church.

415
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,840
 I mean, I was like over-churched.

416
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,560
 I mean, I went to a church school, church on Sunday,

417
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,880
 church on Wednesday, two churches on Sunday.

418
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,120
 I went to Lutheran church, Catholic church,

419
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,680
 First Baptist, Quero, Texas, teen time, every week, man.

420
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,520
 They brought in the speaker

421
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,000
 to do the True Love Waits campaign.

422
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,960
 I bought the ring, I got the certificate,

423
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,280
 dug my heels in the sand.

424
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,720
 I'm going to abstain from sex until I'm married.

425
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,520
 God, I take the vow with all of these people.

426
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,520
 There's no way I'm gonna do that.

427
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,640
 Got in a relationship as a teenager,

428
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,240
 a toxic relationship, crossed physical boundaries

429
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,840
 that just got further and further and further in sex.

430
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,120
 And I remember going home that night it happened.

431
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,600
 And I remember laying in my bed all by myself, weeping.

432
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,160
 How did this happen?

433
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,880
 How did this happen?

434
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,440
 How did I do this thing I promised I would never ever do?

435
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,640
 How did I compromise my convictions?

436
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,480
 And the only way I knew to cope was to do it again.

437
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,560
 And then again and then again and then with her

438
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,880
 and then with her and then with,

439
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,040
 and then it just became sport.

440
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,920
 It became the objective.

441
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,920
 So this thing that I was completely opposed to

442
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,680
 became the thing that I started aiming at.

443
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,880
 I was washed up, man.

444
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,600
 Completely compromised and it ended up

445
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,760
 being completely compromised and it happens with alcohol.

446
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,960
 One mambo taxi turns into two.

447
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,400
 Drugs, money, spending, the way you dress,

448
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,000
 what you watch, what you listen to,

449
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,040
 and what you do contradicts what you say,

450
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,000
 you believe and it's just confusing.

451
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,880
 'Cause who wants to be the only one at the party sober?

452
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,520
 Who wants to be the only one that wasn't invited

453
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,680
 to the party?

454
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,360
 Who wants to be the only one who doesn't see Deadpool

455
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,280
 or Neighbors 2 or who wants to be the only one

456
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,760
 at the lake in a one piece?

457
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,640
 Who wants to be that girl?

458
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,940
 Let me show you some guys.

459
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,240
 Verse 16, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to him,

460
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,520
 "King Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves

461
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,420
 "before you in this matter.

462
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,200
 "If we are thrown into the blazing furnace,

463
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,920
 "the God we serve is able to deliver us from it

464
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,160
 "and he will deliver us from your majesty's hand."

465
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,000
 And listen, underline verse 18, focus on this,

466
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,160
 pay attention.

467
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,200
 But even if he does not,

468
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,080
 but even if he does not,

469
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,860
 we want you to know, your majesty,

470
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,120
 that we will not serve your gods

471
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,600
 or worship the image of gold you have set up.

472
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,080
 I'll tell you why that, but even if he does not,

473
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,800
 is so important, because in our culture, in America,

474
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,160
 we kind of pride ourselves on making decisions

475
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,480
 and we call it critical thinking or problem solving

476
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,680
 and we're taught it in school.

477
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,720
 And so what we do when we're faced with a decision

478
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,560
 is we begin to process the possible outcomes.

479
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,000
 So we look at a decision and we say,

480
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,680
 well, if I make that decision, that will happen.

481
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,120
 If I make this decision, that will happen.

482
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,200
 Now what's the right decision?

483
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,000
 But I'm telling you, you can't judge obedience

484
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,800
 by the outcome or the perceived outcome

485
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,440
 when God's word speaks to it.

486
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,600
 And so that's not what these men,

487
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
 they didn't say, well, if we do that,

488
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
 we're gonna be burned alive,

489
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,840
 but if we don't do that, we'll live,

490
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,520
 so we'll choose life.

491
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,840
 They say, God's in charge of the outcome,

492
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,360
 we're just going to obey and he will rescue us.

493
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,680
 But even if he doesn't,

494
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,320
 we're gonna be faithful,

495
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
 we're gonna hold to our convictions.

496
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,360
 My second point this evening is a real faith

497
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,600
 is uncompromising.

498
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,200
 A real faith doesn't compromise.

499
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
 See, the most creative person on the planet

500
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,960
 is someone seeking to justify their sin.

501
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,320
 All right, in an opportunity to compromise,

502
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,240
 they begin saying things,

503
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,600
 well, does the Bible really say that?

504
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,480
 And you know, I don't know, and what if I do this?

505
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,760
 And they begin to think about

506
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,880
 all of the effective ministry that's gonna happen.

507
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,280
 If they go to the bar, they have the drink,

508
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,520
 or they wear the dress, or whatever it is

509
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,400
 that they're processing.

510
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,800
 I know this dress doesn't cover my butt,

511
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,760
 but, and even though it's a little tight,

512
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,040
 you know, it's still covering everything.

513
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,640
 I know I shouldn't date him,

514
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,040
 but maybe it's a chance to share Jesus.

515
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,520
 I know it's the club, but it's the birthday girl,

516
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,840
 that's where she wants to go,

517
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,560
 and didn't Jesus hang out with sinners?

518
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,240
 It's my boy's bachelor party,

519
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,120
 what am I not supposed to go?

520
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,320
 Like, I'm gonna be the one that doesn't go to the bach,

521
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,360
 that's really what you think God, that's not,

522
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,160
 I don't think that's what God wants.

523
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,160
 And you wanna be liked, so you compromise,

524
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,040
 'cause we're still, even after college,

525
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,960
 trying to be popular, trying to be liked.

526
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,360
 You're working out, looking good,

527
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,600
 you got a new swimsuit, you wanna show it off.

528
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,960
 You go to the lake, the music is playing.

529
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,120
 I mean, of course you're gonna dance,

530
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,200
 you're not even drunk, right?

531
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,000
 People are taking pictures of you,

532
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,840
 and now all of those pictures are getting liked.

533
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,400
 It feels good to be liked.

534
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,960
 So of course the bikini was a great idea.

535
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,800
 Even though your faith is compromised.

536
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,020
 Even though your witness was compromised.

537
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,820
 Even though you confused your message.

538
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,160
 It's worth it, right?

539
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,280
 It happens when we begin to think

540
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,760
 the Bible is an outdated idea.

541
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,200
 Is that what it really means?

542
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,880
 Unless you risk being alone, man.

543
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
 You totally do.

544
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:02,600
 I believe my God is going to give me a spouse.

545
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,240
 But even if he doesn't, I ain't gonna wear that.

546
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,200
 I believe my God is going to save

547
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,440
 this family member I've been praying for.

548
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,740
 But even if he doesn't, I'm not gonna compromise.

549
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:25,280
 I believe he's going to bring me some friends.

550
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,880
 But even if he doesn't, I'm not going to the club, man.

551
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,720
 Not up for that.

552
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,080
 But even if he doesn't, and yes it will cost you,

553
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,840
 and yes I have paid the price on occasion.

554
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,380
 I have failed at this miserably.

555
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,840
 Like sometimes I'm just convicted,

556
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,240
 and I'm like, am I leading them astray?

557
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,920
 Am I trying to be the cool Christian at times?

558
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,720
 Am I standing out enough?

559
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,480
 I can remember on one particular occasion,

560
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,720
 I was in charge of planning the bachelor party,

561
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,960
 and so I did everything I could.

562
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,880
 I was a believer, I was walking with Christ,

563
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,720
 and so I rented a tour bus.

564
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,680
 That was my grand idea, and we stopped at one place

565
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,160
 as we were gonna go fishing,

566
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,720
 and we stopped at one place where there was alcohol,

567
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,120
 and it was a restaurant and whatnot.

568
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,240
 And we get out for an hour, we eat,

569
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,040
 and as we get back on the bus,

570
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,000
 all the guys, they've convinced some girls

571
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,640
 to come on the bus with us and to go fishing with us.

572
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,720
 Some of them married.

573
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,140
 And I stood at the door, and I'm like,

574
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,640
 not today, boys.

575
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,840
 It's not gonna happen today.

576
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,000
 It wasn't me, I mean the Holy Spirit strengthened

577
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,400
 my conviction in the moment, gave me courage in the moment,

578
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,200
 and it cost me, I talked about it here,

579
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,880
 and I mean it cost me relationships.

580
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,180
 I mean guys said, hey, we're done, dude.

581
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,480
 Taking your faith too far, man, we are so out.

582
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,840
 We are so done with that.

583
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:00,160
 But it's been amazing to watch as the years have passed by

584
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,880
 how God has gone back and grabbed the hearts

585
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,820
 of some of those men and made them real men

586
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,460
 and amazing husbands and amazing fathers.

587
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,920
 And in ways I never, I didn't even have enough faith

588
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,160
 to believe that he would.

589
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,720
 He's done incredible things.

590
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,240
 And so you gotta say, hey, this is what I'm gonna do

591
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,000
 because it's right, and my God is gonna,

592
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,400
 he's gonna help me, he's gonna protect me,

593
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,900
 but even if he doesn't, I'm not gonna compromise.

594
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,840
 I'm not gonna compromise what I know to be right.

595
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,880
 And if you wanna compromise your convictions

596
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,840
 and you wanna walk through life

597
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,200
 with a weak, counterfeit faith,

598
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,460
 you will have plenty of opportunities.

599
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,700
 I mean, listen, we have, let's just kinda go

600
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,100
 through the gamut of what has happened on our watch, right?

601
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,100
 We've redefined marriage, okay, boys.

602
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,340
 Boys, like as you raise girls, okay, like I'm raising girls,

603
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,020
 as you raise girls, I'm talking to you now, okay,

604
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,420
 boys are gonna be able to go to the bathroom with them.

605
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,060
 That's going to happen, and that happened on our watch.

606
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,820
 I know our grandparents' generation introduced divorce

607
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,900
 into the situation.

608
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,380
 This is what we've introduced into the situation

609
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,420
 on our watch.

610
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,980
 These are the things that we've done.

611
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,420
 We're working to legalize marijuana

612
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,660
 and increasingly more and more as logic is applied

613
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,480
 to the issues, it is identified as hate speech,

614
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,320
 which is crazy.

615
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,140
 Like imagine this, you're trying to lovingly explain

616
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,300
 to someone that they are a boy because they have a penis

617
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,660
 and you're called a bigot.

618
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:29,300
 And some of you here and listening

619
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,460
 take pride in the reality that this has happened

620
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,340
 on our watch, we call it civil rights.

621
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,860
 And I say, what?

622
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,860
 Oh my, what a tremendous insult

623
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,820
 to the civil rights movement.

624
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:49,140
 What a tremendous insult.

625
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,860
 And don't you understand in civil rights,

626
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,060
 it was the people who were marching against the culture

627
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,900
 of that time.

628
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,420
 Now it's everyone marching with the culture of that time,

629
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,060
 calling it good and right and true.

630
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,260
 Now listen, listen, in case you're about to leave

631
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,180
 or you're frustrated or you disagree,

632
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,700
 I love my transgender friends.

633
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,140
 I love my homosexual people

634
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,100
 who identify as homosexual friends.

635
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,020
 What you need, a room, you got a room, stay at my house.

636
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,740
 You need money, I got you.

637
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,460
 Let me know, how can I serve you?

638
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,500
 How can I help you?

639
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,860
 But I'm not gonna further your confusion

640
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,500
 by caving into what culture teaches.

641
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,260
 That's not helpful.

642
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,840
 (congregation applauding)

643
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,980
 Praise God for some agreement.

644
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,400
 But even if you didn't,

645
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
 I ain't gonna compromise.

646
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,040
 I'm gonna lovingly teach the truth.

647
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,280
 Like these men lovingly, do you see what they did?

648
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,120
 They winsomely said, "Your majesty."

649
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:53,600
 And it started in Daniel one, two chapters before this.

650
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,440
 They're asked to eat some defiling food.

651
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,700
 The king is offering them a feast and wine.

652
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,160
 And we don't know why it would defile them.

653
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,560
 Maybe it was sacrifice to idols.

654
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,720
 Maybe it was unclean food.

655
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,200
 But they're asked to eat it.

656
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,840
 And they say, "We won't do that."

657
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,680
 But they don't say it like that.

658
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,320
 They don't say, "Hey, we won't do that."

659
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,880
 They say, "Hey, can we suggest something else?"

660
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,160
 Like, what if you just feed us vegetables?

661
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,360
 And they say, "Well, if we just feed you vegetables,

662
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,600
 "you're not going to be able to do the work that the king."

663
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,120
 No, what if you feed us vegetables

664
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,240
 and we work harder than everybody else

665
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,800
 and we do everything that you ask us to?

666
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,320
 Will you just give it a try?

667
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,000
 And they say, yeah, here's what they're saying.

668
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,160
 They say, "Hey, let us prove our convictions

669
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,520
 "are right to you.

670
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,480
 "Give us time and observe us.

671
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,340
 "We don't have to hate you.

672
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,260
 "We don't have to talk aggressively or with angst to you.

673
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,160
 "We don't have to be mean to you.

674
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,620
 "Can we just sit down and talk logically about this issue?

675
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,260
 "And will you give me some time

676
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,560
 "and see if I can win you over

677
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,880
 "in the way that I work diligent

678
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,760
 "and how I winsomely disagree?"

679
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:09,160
 My friend Blake, the guy that caught his deck on fire,

680
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:14,080
 he didn't know where his fire extinguisher was,

681
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,180
 but that brother knows where his faith is.

682
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,120
 He uses it all the time.

683
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,440
 I get to see him use it all the time.

684
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,000
 And let me tell you something, he's a dad.

685
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,360
 And when his son, his five-year-old,

686
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,520
 was hit with acute lymphoma leukemia,

687
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,560
 a terminal sickness,

688
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,720
 that brother's on the ninth floor

689
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,280
 of Children's Medical Center,

690
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,640
 and he said, "Hey, you don't determine

691
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,480
 "if you have a faith."

692
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,480
 I'm on the ninth floor of Children's Medical Center.

693
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,440
 When you watch your son getting poked and prodded

694
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,900
 and poisoned intentionally and screaming in pain and agony,

695
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,760
 and you sit and you watch on this side of a glass,

696
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,640
 you don't decide then,

697
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,520
 "Hey, do I really believe I can trust you, God?

698
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,060
 "God, I trust that you're going to heal my son,

699
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,900
 "but even if you don't, I'm not gonna turn away from you.

700
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,640
 "God, I trust you're gonna bring someone to me

701
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,940
 "to spend the rest of my life with,

702
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,940
 "but if you don't, I'm not wagering that bet with you.

703
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,320
 "I'll go to heaven with you

704
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,400
 "and indulge in all the glories of your presence

705
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,340
 "if it means being single the rest of my days.

706
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,920
 "I trust you will give me a child one day,

707
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,340
 "but if you don't, I'm not gonna turn from you.

708
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,980
 "I trust you will save my loved one,

709
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,780
 "but even if you don't, God,

710
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,960
 "there's nothing that would turn my heart from you."

711
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,200
 Verse 19.

712
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,180
 Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious

713
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,820
 with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

714
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,220
 and his attitude toward them changed now,

715
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,900
 no longer bargaining, no longer wanting to talk.

716
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,980
 He ordered that the furnace be heated

717
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,100
 seven times hotter than usual,

718
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,440
 and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army

719
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,740
 to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

720
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,960
 and throw them into the blazing furnace.

721
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,600
 So these men wearing their robes, their trousers,

722
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,660
 their turbans, and other clothes

723
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,880
 were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace.

724
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,660
 It's going to great lengths to show you the detail

725
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,740
 that these men have a lot of flammable things on, okay?

726
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,540
 They're gonna be torched.

727
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,900
 But the king's command was so urgent,

728
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,980
 it was so hasty, he's so angry,

729
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,940
 and the furnace was so hot that the flames of the fire

730
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,540
 killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach,

731
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,680
 and Abednego, and these three men firmly tied

732
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,780
 fell into the blazing furnace.

733
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,460
 This is nonsense and rage is what's happening.

734
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,120
 Because listen, if you wanna slowly,

735
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,420
 I mean, if you wanna torture somebody,

736
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,540
 if you're mad at them, you don't turn a furnace up,

737
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,860
 you turn it down.

738
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,560
 You say, hey, cool down the fire, let them burn slow,

739
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,220
 I wanna hear their screams, I know that's sick,

740
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,100
 but that's what you would do, right?

741
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,060
 You wouldn't say, hey, turn it up seven times hotter

742
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,140
 so they're burned right away.

743
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:45,980
 What's God doing here?

744
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,380
 God is using the rage of man to show you how powerful he is.

745
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,660
 Stack the cards against me, I'm God, watch me flex.

746
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,340
 That's what he said.

747
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,020
 (congregation laughing)

748
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,960
 It's the new JP version.

749
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,520
 (congregation laughing)

750
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,880
 It's what he said.

751
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,960
 You want me to fight a giant?

752
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,400
 Give me a boy and some rocks.

753
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,200
 I don't need a tank, man.

754
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,200
 He's God.

755
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:20,560
 Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement

756
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,200
 and asked his advisors, weren't there three men

757
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,200
 that we tied up and threw into the fire?

758
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,120
 They replied, certainly, your majesty.

759
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,400
 Man, just, okay, 'cause I like blew past it.

760
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,240
 Can you imagine the angst and the heartache

761
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,520
 that you would feel on that day?

762
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,040
 Hey, guys, we were faithful, you're looking at your boys.

763
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,560
 I also love the fact that they weren't alone,

764
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,800
 said you're gonna be left alone,

765
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,360
 but these guys had community.

766
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,060
 They were in it together, locked arms, let's go.

767
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,080
 We're not gonna compromise our faith.

768
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,560
 But they're looking at each other in the eyes,

769
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,720
 they're looking at the furnace, they feel the heat.

770
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,320
 I'm like, man, here it is, man.

771
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,000
 It's been real, let's go.

772
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,340
 (congregation laughing)

773
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,800
 He says, wait a minute, what's going on?

774
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,560
 There were three men that we threw in the fire.

775
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,400
 I don't understand, he said, look,

776
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,840
 I see four men walking around in the fire now,

777
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,440
 unbound and unharmed, and the fourth one

778
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,280
 looks like a son of the gods.

779
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,320
 That word gods there is Elohim.

780
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,840
 It's where we get the, it's the word for the one true God,

781
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,060
 the Yahweh, Jehovah, that we worship.

782
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:28,440
 And in there is the son of that God protecting them.

783
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,780
 He's in the fire with them.

784
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,420
 And Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening

785
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,780
 of the blazing furnace and shouted,

786
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,420
 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

787
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,860
 servants of the most high God, come out, come here.

788
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,100
 So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire,

789
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,140
 and the satraps, prefects, governor,

790
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,340
 and royal advisors crowded around them.

791
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,340
 And they saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies,

792
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:52,900
 nor was their hair, nor was a hair of their heads singed.

793
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,500
 Their robes were not scorched,

794
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,620
 and there was no smell of fire on them.

795
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,980
 Then Nebuchadnezzar said,

796
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,540
 praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

797
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,080
 who has sent his angel, anytime you see his angel

798
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,960
 or the angel of the Lord,

799
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,020
 it's a reference to the pre-incarnate Christ, Jesus,

800
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,420
 before he was born of Mary, 2,016 years ago.

801
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,540
 He has sent his angel and rescued his servants.

802
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,980
 They trusted in him and defied the king's command

803
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,740
 and were willing to give their lives

804
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:28,220
 rather than serve or worship any God except their own God.

805
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,300
 "Therefore I decree that the people of any nation

806
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,180
 "or language who say anything against the God

807
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,300
 "of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be cut into pieces,

808
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,680
 "and their houses be turned into piles of rubble,

809
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,700
 "for no God can save in this way."

810
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,380
 And the three were promoted over the province of Babylon.

811
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:50,020
 So this man who is completely crazy, he hates God,

812
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,680
 and he won't let anyone worship the one true God,

813
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,040
 now he turns, completely worships that God,

814
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,700
 and says, "Hey, if you don't worship him,

815
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,740
 "I'm gonna cut you into pieces and tear down your house,

816
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,880
 "and I ain't playing."

817
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,140
 He's crazy.

818
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:10,500
 And Jesus shows up in the fire and protects them.

819
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,820
 And it happened, it's not like a fairy tale,

820
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,160
 it's not like this thing like Disney made up.

821
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,500
 It's true, and so my third and final point

822
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,620
 is real faith converts critics.

823
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,420
 Real faith converts critics.

824
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:31,080
 See, when people see you faithfully living out your faith,

825
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,000
 they take an interest in your faith.

826
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,860
 It's weird, you're the only person there sober,

827
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,820
 that's so weird, like why do you do that?

828
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,980
 It's intriguing to me, let's talk about it.

829
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,480
 So you go to this thing every Tuesday,

830
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,220
 like tell me more about that.

831
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,060
 What are y'all, do you sing songs, is it like youth camp?

832
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,780
 Like what do you do there?

833
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,980
 Two guys named Shane, that's weird.

834
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,320
 (congregation laughing)

835
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,560
 So tell me more about this Jesus,

836
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,020
 so you think he's gonna take you through the grave

837
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:11,980
 into eternal life.

838
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,060
 See, you won't have faith in the furnace

839
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:22,060
 unless you have faith that Jesus

840
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,860
 endured a worse furnace for you.

841
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,980
 That in the Garden of Gethsemane,

842
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,060
 as he sweat blood facing the cross,

843
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,640
 that that was done for you.

844
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,540
 That he died the death that you deserve

845
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,940
 and he did it for you so that you could be with him forever,

846
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,140
 not because of your works,

847
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,620
 but because you believe that he paid the price

848
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,460
 for you to enter God's kingdom

849
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,820
 through his death and his resurrection.

850
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,820
 And you begin to live out that faith and it's weird.

851
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:59,860
 I've seen it happen, I've got to run with you guys

852
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,920
 for about a decade now.

853
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,260
 And every now and then there's someone that just stands out,

854
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,140
 kind of like man, that guy or that girl, they get it.

855
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,300
 And this one individual, before I ever met him,

856
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,340
 I had heard of him.

857
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,900
 'Cause I heard how he was a division one athlete,

858
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,740
 how he was a starter, a team lead.

859
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,460
 And I heard how he continued to courageously

860
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,300
 live out his faith.

861
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,660
 Before I ever met him,

862
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,580
 I heard how he chose not to laugh

863
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,420
 at the inappropriate jokes in the locker room.

864
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,540
 How he tried, or he didn't try to fit in

865
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,660
 with the bad language that the other guys were saying,

866
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,280
 that he chose not to treat the other freshmen teammates

867
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,740
 poorly, to get a laugh from his coach or his teammates.

868
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:50,420
 And I heard, I had heard specifically about how he was made

869
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,220
 fun of because of the decisions that he made

870
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,100
 and how he wasn't invited to the parties.

871
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,420
 And as he was a strong, good looking young man

872
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,020
 with a lot of things going for him,

873
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,820
 he had been rejected by some of his classmates

874
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,660
 and some of his teammates.

875
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,020
 And of course, as an athlete and a good looking guy

876
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,620
 and a starter and a team leader,

877
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,220
 some girls gave him a lot of attention,

878
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,080
 some girls that really matters to.

879
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,720
 And so, they were willing to come up to him

880
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,160
 and swoon for him.

881
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,400
 And he had made a commitment to treat them different.

882
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,960
 In fact, he saw it as an opportunity

883
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,880
 to minister to his teammates

884
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,960
 in the way that he talked to them and spent time with them

885
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,800
 and the way that he was intentional about what he did

886
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,000
 and didn't do with those girls.

887
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,800
 And on one particular occasion,

888
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,760
 and this was the story that I was like,

889
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,400
 "Man, I've got to meet this guy."

890
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,240
 His position coach, he played football,

891
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,240
 his position coach had come to his teammates and said,

892
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,280
 "Hey, I want you to bring some violent images

893
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,540
 "and we're gonna put them on this wall

894
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,160
 "to kind of cast a vision for us to be tough

895
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,600
 "and violent and aggressive out there.

896
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,200
 "You guys bring the most violent images you can."

897
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,000
 And so, his teammates began to bring crime scenes

898
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,520
 and pictures of mutilation and pictures of genocide

899
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,960
 and some of the most grotesque images that you can imagine.

900
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,200
 He didn't do that.

901
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,040
 The coach pulled him aside as the players got excited

902
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,360
 about this little exercise, this homework, if you will.

903
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,200
 And the coach said, "Hey, I need you to bring an image."

904
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,080
 And when his time went on and he didn't,

905
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,600
 the coach came to him again and said,

906
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,800
 "Hey, I'm serious about this assignment."

907
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,160
 And the third time that he was inquired

908
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,920
 about this assignment, he brought a picture and he says,

909
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,720
 "This is the most violent image I can think of, coach.

910
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,520
 "It's a picture of Jesus Christ

911
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,760
 "being crucified on the cross.

912
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,240
 "It's a scene from the Passion.

913
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,360
 "And this is when all of my sins went on Him.

914
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,520
 "And so, this is the most violent image I can imagine.

915
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,200
 "Let's put this on the wall."

916
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,760
 It's counter-cultural.

917
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,840
 It's uncompromising.

918
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:11,800
 And this coach that didn't like him very much said,

919
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,560
 "Man, that's really convicting.

920
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,680
 "Let's have a conversation."

921
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,040
 And my friend got to share the gospel with him

922
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,880
 and got to walk him through how he can have

923
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,280
 a relationship with Christ.

924
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:29,520
 Real faith converts critics.

925
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,120
 It may not happen right away, but you stay strong.

926
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:38,560
 It's your ability to make it through the furnace

927
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,600
 will be in direct relation to the amount of faith

928
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,800
 you have that Jesus went through the furnace for you.

929
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,720
 How you doing right now?

930
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,800
 You gotta answer the question.

931
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,440
 Do you have a real faith?

932
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,240
 You in, you going all in with Christ?

933
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,240
 Does He influence how you date,

934
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,240
 what you do on the weekends, how you talk,

935
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,240
 who you hang out with, your playmates,

936
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,960
 and your friends, and your family?

937
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,000
 Who do you hang out with, your playmates

938
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,040
 and your playground?

939
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,160
 Is that the scariest thing in the world to you right now?

940
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,720
 Don't, I'll do anything, don't tell me to change my friends.

941
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,400
 Like that's a terrifying thought, JP.

942
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,200
 You know, that's my story.

943
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,240
 Came to a place where I'm like, man, I just can't do that.

944
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,200
 I can't do Lake Louisville every weekend.

945
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,200
 I can't do Lower Greenville anymore, guys.

946
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,440
 I'm out, God's calling me to something better.

947
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,400
 I'm gonna tell you a story that kind of illustrates

948
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
 this going all in.

949
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,000
 It's about a guy in the 1800s, his name was Blondine.

950
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,920
 In the 1800s, they didn't have, you know,

951
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,360
 stadiums and TVs to watch for entertainment.

952
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,960
 And so the circus acts was a way

953
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,520
 that everyone would gather around,

954
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,840
 crowds would gather and people would be entertained.

955
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,400
 And so this particular man, Blondine from Paris,

956
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,080
 he was a tightrope walker.

957
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,800
 And his most famous feat was he walked 1,100 feet

958
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,800
 across Niagara Falls on a tight walk.

959
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,520
 He was the first person ever to walk across Niagara Falls

960
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,360
 on a tightrope.

961
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,440
 And when he did it, I mean, the crowds from Canada

962
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,000
 and America came around and gathered and would go crazy

963
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,880
 to watch this guy.

964
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,840
 And just like us, you know, to be entertained,

965
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,760
 you gotta keep making it crazier and crazier.

966
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,000
 And so he would do it on stilts, he did it blindfolded.

967
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,440
 He did it one day where he cooked an egg out there

968
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,000
 and ate an omelet in the middle of the tightrope

969
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,960
 over Niagara Falls.

970
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,200
 And on this one particular day,

971
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,600
 as thousands of people gathered around,

972
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,820
 he pushed a wheelbarrow across it, blindfolded.

973
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:35,720
 And the wheelbarrow was full of concrete,

974
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,320
 350 pounds of concrete.

975
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,000
 And he pushed it to the other side and he emptied it out.

976
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,400
 And he began to interact with the crowds as he often does.

977
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,720
 And he says, "Do you guys believe I can walk

978
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,560
 "across this rope?"

979
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,700
 And they said, "You can, you're the great Blondine.

980
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,820
 "We know you can."

981
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,100
 And he said, "Do you believe that I can do it

982
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,120
 "with this wheelbarrow?"

983
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,400
 And they said, "Yes, you can, you're the great Blondine."

984
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,080
 And he said, "Do you believe that I can push someone

985
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,840
 "across the tightrope in this wheelbarrow?"

986
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,240
 And they said, "Yes, you're the great Blondine.

987
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,240
 "Of course you can."

988
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,440
 And there was one particularly enthusiastic fan

989
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,920
 right there front and center.

990
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,520
 And he said, "What about you?

991
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,660
 "Do you believe I can push someone across this tightrope

992
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,680
 "in the wheelbarrow?"

993
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,640
 And he said, "Of course."

994
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,640
 The crowds got silence as this dialogue happened.

995
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,000
 He said, "Of course you're the great Blondine.

996
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,580
 "I've seen you do it.

997
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,560
 "I know you can."

998
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,600
 He said, "Great, get in the wheelbarrow."

999
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,020
 (congregation laughing)

1000
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,920
 And the crowds listened as the man refused.

1001
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,580
 He said, "I can't do that."

1002
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:41,520
 And it's such a picture of so many of us praising God,

1003
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,680
 worshiping with the crowd.

1004
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,440
 We love you, Jesus.

1005
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,560
 Thank you for dying on the cross.

1006
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,520
 Thank you for paying for our sins.

1007
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,160
 We have so much faith in you.

1008
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,360
 We have so much faith in you.

1009
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,800
 He says, "Hey, great, put your life in my hands."

1010
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,400
 Date how I desire you to date.

1011
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,320
 Hang out and fellowship in a way that honors me.

1012
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,480
 Have conversations that honor me.

1013
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,360
 Can I have the time that you spend on your computer?

1014
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:17,480
 Can I control, for the sake of your own freedom,

1015
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,160
 the way you dress and who you hang out with

1016
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,720
 and what you find identity in

1017
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,300
 and how you spend your money?

1018
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,260
 And where you work and what you do for fun

1019
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,300
 and whom you love?

1020
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,140
 No, Jesus.

1021
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:39,880
 We just wanna be with the fans.

1022
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,200
 Don't call us to anything, Jesus.

1023
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,200
 I have a faith.

1024
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,040
 Don't make me use it, Jesus.

1025
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,180
 I don't wanna go through the furnace, Jesus.

1026
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:56,640
 I have a faith, I hope I never have to use it, Jesus.

1027
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,620
 Don't call me to stand out.

1028
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,460
 They're gonna make fun of me.

1029
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,060
 I'm gonna be left alone, Jesus.

1030
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,220
 It's interesting, and I didn't know this

1031
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,640
 when I first heard this story,

1032
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,260
 but Blondine's manager eventually did go

1033
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,380
 across that rope with him.

1034
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:17,280
 And I find it ironic because he had spent

1035
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,240
 the most time with him.

1036
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,680
 He had seen that he had done it the most

1037
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,600
 and had the most faith.

1038
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,420
 In his ability.

1039
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,740
 And so of course he said, "Hey, I'm willing."

1040
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:33,460
 And that's what God is calling you to right now.

1041
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,960
 I hope some of you are tired of playing

1042
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,020
 the Christian games.

1043
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,880
 I hope right now as you sit in a seat,

1044
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,780
 see, you can't decide how you're gonna date

1045
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,200
 when you're in the hotel room,

1046
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,120
 when you're in the back seat,

1047
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,160
 when you're in your apartment alone.

1048
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,480
 That's not when you say, "Okay, now how far am I gonna go?"

1049
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,560
 Right now, you say, "Hey, Jesus, you got my celibacy, man.

1050
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,380
 "If I'm the 40-year-old virgin, it's all good.

1051
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,600
 "Make a movie about me.

1052
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,220
 "It's all good.

1053
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,840
 "Hey, Jesus, I'm not attracted to the same sex.

1054
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,460
 "Doesn't seem fair.

1055
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:10,240
 "I think you're gonna change that in me.

1056
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,500
 "But even if you don't, I'm not gonna compromise.

1057
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:20,620
 "I'll die celibate, go to heaven, inherit your kingdom,

1058
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,040
 "hashtag winning.

1059
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,020
 "Let's go."

1060
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,740
 You ready?

1061
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,660
 You ready to go all in with Christ?

1062
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:38,340
 He's not making you get up on the cross.

1063
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,720
 He got up on the cross for you,

1064
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,320
 but he's asking you to carry it.

1065
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,060
 Let me pray that you would.

1066
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,400
 (pastor clicks tongue)

1067
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:59,260
 Father, in the midst of blazing hot furnace,

1068
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:06,740
 strengthen our resolve to cry out to a watching world

1069
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:13,180
 that may hate us to burn us up.

1070
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,420
 Give us the courage to stand out.

1071
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,420
 Give us the courage to take up our cross tomorrow

1072
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:24,420
 when we wake up in our office, in our relationship,

1073
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,680
 in all that we do.

1074
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,220
 Father, help us to worship you.

1075
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:39,460
 Help us to give our entire lives and existence

1076
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,780
 and everything for you.

1077
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,220
 Would you create not an audience of this place,

1078
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:47,660
 but an army to march against everything

1079
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:50,760
 that is wicked in our culture to stand for truth?

1080
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,140
 And would you help us to do that winsomely

1081
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:57,140
 and lovingly with compassion and grace?

1082
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:03,500
 And in the midst of the fiery challenges of this life,

1083
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,160
 give us the faith to scream out, burn us up.

1084
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:17,160
