[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:13.780]   - Porch, what's good?
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.600]   How we doing?
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.640]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.800]   Hey, it's so great to be with you.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.040]   Great to worship with you.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.440]   I wanna welcome those who are tuning in
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.320]   just through the stream and at other campuses and whatnot.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.160]   And so it's just been a dream to be able
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.580]   to give you an alternative to the world,
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.040]   to the bars, to the clubs,
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.200]   to whatever else you might be doing on a Tuesday night.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.360]   And so when I trusted Christ,
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.180]   like listen, I was a complete mess.
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.080]   And it's just, as I was worshiping,
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.520]   I was reflecting on God's grace in my life
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.760]   and the addictions that owned me,
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.960]   the drug use that owned me,
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.800]   the sexual addictions and perversions that owned me,
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.400]   and then got to experience His grace and forgiveness,
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.700]   came into the church.
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.340]   I was bored out of my mind at church growing up
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.280]   and didn't have a relationship with Jesus.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.520]   And thought like really Christians were kind of weird
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.160]   and they were just kind of acting like,
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.600]   God was good, but really like, is God really good?
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.980]   And so as I came into a relationship with Him,
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.980]   I began to experience life for the first time.
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.380]   I'm not crazy, I'm not naive.
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.320]   I'm not just saying that because I'm up here.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.920]   I truly began to experience life as it was intended.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.220]   And a part of that was getting to share my faith with others
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.880]   and a part of sharing my faith with others
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.960]   was getting to travel all over the world
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.400]   on what you may have heard as called mission trips.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.600]   We call them international discipleship trips.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.920]   And so going to Africa and to Haiti and to different places.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.280]   One of the places that I went to, in fact, my favorite,
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.280]   most memorable was to Brazil and getting on the Amazon River
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.440]   and going down the Amazon River, sharing the gospel.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.840]   And the challenge with this particular trip
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.120]   is you stay on a boat the entire time for eight days.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.760]   And so you got to pack for about 10 days, eight days
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.640]   in a bag about this size, okay?
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.360]   And that's honestly not the problem is packing,
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.520]   you know, for eight to 10 days in a bag this size.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.360]   The problem with this particular trip
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.120]   is you've got to pack in a bag like this for 10 days
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.880]   and it has to weigh under 50 pounds.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.480]   You guys done that thing where you get up there
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.200]   and you're like moving blow dryers around
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.720]   and switching shoes and hey, can I put this in your bag?
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.200]   And so you can't do that.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.040]   Like we're going there, we're flying into Manaus, Brazil.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.960]   We stay the night in a hotel and the next day
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.000]   we're on a boat and we're going down the river
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.440]   for seven or eight days and we're getting off at villages
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.920]   and we're sharing the gospel.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.280]   And so you got to be packed up,
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.080]   the bag's got to be under 50 pounds.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.040]   And so we're there with this team of young adults
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.080]   and you can imagine my confusion
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.440]   and a little bit my frustration
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.760]   when I see one girl pulls this out of her bag.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.640]   It's a bag of rocks.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.320]   In Brazil, she brought a bag of rocks to Brazil.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.240]   I'm like, what are you doing?
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.160]   Like, how did you get that past customs first of all?
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.680]   And why, like they have rocks in Brazil.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.840]   You don't need to bring American rocks to Brazil.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.840]   Like, why are you doing this?
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.680]   And what did you not bring because of that?
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.200]   And we're having this conversation
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.240]   and she begins to tell me that she's in this Bible study,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.580]   her and another girl on the trip are in this Bible study
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.920]   and they're working through forgiveness.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.720]   And so what they had to do is for every person
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.000]   in their life that they had not forgiven,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.200]   they had to put a rock and carry it with them
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.080]   until they were choosing to forgive them.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.500]   And so as we're moving through Brazil,
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.320]   as we get on a boat, I think we have a picture of the boat,
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.920]   I don't know if we've shown that to you,
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   but as we're on this boat traveling down the Amazon River,
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.540]   she's with this bag of rocks
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.320]   representing every person in her life
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.560]   that she hasn't forgiven is my friend, Ali.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.920]   And so it's just this,
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.520]   it's a great example of the weight of bitterness.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.280]   It's a great example of the weight of unforgiveness.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.920]   A great example of the things that we carry,
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.460]   every one of you, when you came in here tonight,
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.560]   you're carrying some anger.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.960]   You may not even see it, you may not even know what it is.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.840]   And so we're in this series called Vice and Virtue.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.240]   We've covered pride and humility, laziness and discipline,
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.240]   entitlement and gratitude, greed and generosity.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.340]   And tonight we're talking about anger and forgiveness,
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.320]   really how the solution to anger is forgiveness.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.080]   And I'm not talking about just regular, generic,
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.780]   you're angry that the Patriots lost.
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.180]   I'm not talking about that.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.080]   I'm talking about an anger that's targeted towards someone.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.160]   Call it bitterness, call it unforgiveness, if you will,
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.240]   but it's anger that you carry toward someone.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.360]   And so I wanna ask you some questions.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.500]   Who are the people in your life that have wronged you?
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.920]   Maybe it was a parent that abandoned you.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.000]   Maybe it was an ex-boyfriend or an ex-girlfriend
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.920]   that hurt you.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.640]   Maybe it was parents that broke their promise
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.120]   to love each other for the rest of their life.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.640]   Maybe it was someone who made fun of you,
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.040]   or bullied you,
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.260]   or abused you.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.220]   Those thoughts that you've suppressed
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.320]   that you promised never to bring up again.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.500]   Has anyone betrayed you?
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.200]   I want you to think of their name.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.340]   If revenge were possible right now,
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.780]   who would be the top person on your list?
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.860]   See, when I realized I was talking about anger,
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.280]   I'm like, do I really struggle with anger?
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.700]   You know, now that I've become,
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.060]   when I was, before I became a Christian,
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.400]   like, yes, anger was a tool that I would use.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.100]   You know, it was something that I would,
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.380]   I thought I was displaying my masculinity.
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.140]   And I was either yelling at a girlfriend
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.780]   or in a basketball game, you know,
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.540]   getting hit with an elbow, and then, you know,
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.700]   next thing I know, I'm in a fight
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.100]   right in the middle of the court, displaying my anger.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.060]   It was a tool.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.180]   I thought it was something that I would use to win debates,
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.240]   something that I would use to lead people,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.360]   something that I would use strategically
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.580]   to get the attention of others.
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.520]   And show that, hey, don't mess with me.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.740]   And I was a child.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.380]   I was a child.
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.220]   And I know some of you feel completely justified
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.860]   in the anger that you brought in here this evening.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.740]   Maybe you resent people who seem to have an easy life.
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.240]   There, maybe there's conversations
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.140]   that are replaying in your head when you're alone.
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.600]   Americans, we've never been more angry than we are right now.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.940]   You can just go on Google and search outraged
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.460]   and see the results, how many different groups
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.020]   of people are outraged.
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.940]   And there's these movements like Me Too and Time's Up
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.060]   and Black Lives Matter and all of the other hashtags
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.300]   that are out there that really just represent
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.900]   either an angry person or an angry people group.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.040]   And some of them completely justified
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.780]   in the way that they were hurt by someone.
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.460]   All of those hashtags, all of those movements
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.900]   represent one person hurting another.
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.700]   Who are you angry at?
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.860]   Who hurt you?
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:21.180]   And so we're carrying rocks.
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.260]   If you're here in Dallas, I want you to hold your rock
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.100]   through this message.
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.020]   When you came in this evening, you got a rock.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.160]   Some of you at campus has got a rock.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.380]   I want you to pick up that rock.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.420]   I want you to hold it in your hand throughout the message.
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.580]   As we dive into the scripture,
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.600]   we're gonna be in Matthew chapter 18.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.140]   Listen, if you're listening somewhere else
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.640]   and you don't have a rock in your hand,
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.620]   here's what I want you to do.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.980]   I want you to write down the name of a person
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:41.800]   that you're angry at,
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.060]   or I want you to write down an experience that you had
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.360]   that when you think back, it causes you some anxiety.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.460]   It causes you to be overwhelmed with anger.
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.380]   So as you hold that rock, now moving to a serious moment,
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.660]   okay, as you hold that rock right now,
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.160]   I want you to think of what that is.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.300]   What is that experience?
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.380]   Who is that person?
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.500]   What is the bitterness, the unforgiveness,
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.180]   the anger that you brought in here this evening?
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.620]   In research, this comes from everydayhealth.com,
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.340]   indicates the way that anger damages our health.
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.580]   It says that anger can cause damage to your heart,
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.620]   increases your risk of a stroke,
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.620]   it weakens your immune system,
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.180]   anger increases anxiety and stress,
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.020]   anger is linked to depression.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.860]   It literally damages your lungs and respiratory health,
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.000]   and that people who are habitually angry
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.620]   are sick more often, and anger shortens your life.
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.420]   From a separate source, this comes from the Mayo Clinic.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.860]   Doctors listed the benefit of forgiveness.
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.740]   They said that people who can forgive people
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.860]   have healthier relationships, improved mental health,
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.700]   less anxiety, stress, and hostility, lower blood pressure,
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.860]   people who forgive people have fewer symptoms of depression,
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.260]   stronger immune system, improved heart health,
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.740]   and improved self-esteem.
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.820]   And I know that you think, or some of you think,
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.460]   that the anger that you have, it's a righteous anger.
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.340]   That it's an anger that God's okay with.
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.760]   To that I say, maybe it is, maybe it is.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.140]   Maybe.
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:21.140]   But for most of us, the anger that we carry most of the time
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.140]   it's simply sin that leaves us alone and bitter.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:31.100]   And a God who loves you doesn't want that for you.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.340]   And so we're gonna look at how you've been given,
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.580]   how you've given God a reason to be angry at you.
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.700]   Secondly, how God deals with his anger towards you.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.860]   And how our anger against others is confusing,
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.840]   and what we are to do about it.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.700]   I told you we'd be in Matthew 18.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.180]   Matthew 18 is a chapter known as church discipline.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.140]   And so this is literally how we deal with someone
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.440]   who sins against us.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.100]   It says that we're to go to that person
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:56.920]   and we're to tell them.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.660]   Such a novel idea that we don't practice.
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.380]   When someone hurts us, we don't suppress it,
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.040]   we don't ignore it, we don't flippantly just move on.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.140]   We go to them and we look them in the eyes
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.100]   and we say, "Hey, you hurt me, bye."
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.300]   And if they don't listen to us,
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.820]   then we take a friend with us.
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.460]   So that they might listen to both of us.
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.980]   And they don't listen to the both of us,
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.740]   then we would go to the church.
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:16.940]   And we would say, "Hey pastors,
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.760]   "can you help us work through this conflict?
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.140]   "This person hurts me and they don't care."
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.180]   And it says if they don't listen to the church,
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.000]   then you treat them like an unbeliever.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.820]   That is, assume that they don't have
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.820]   a relationship with Christ.
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.440]   And so you would share the gospel with them.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.740]   You would live this out.
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.260]   Jesus is telling Peter this.
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.940]   He's instructing his disciples,
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.100]   which warrants this question.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.820]   Peter comes back and he says this.
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.780]   Then Peter came to Jesus and asked,
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.780]   "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.240]   "when he sins against me?
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.420]   "Should I do it up to seven times?"
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.420]   See, it was Jewish tradition that a good Jew
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.700]   would forgive someone up to three times.
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.540]   And so Peter's speaking in hyperbole.
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.060]   He goes ahead and takes that number,
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.180]   he multiplies it by two and adds one for good grace
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.500]   and says, "Should I do it up to seven times?"
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.420]   And Jesus says, "Not seven times, but 77 times."
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.660]   Or seven times 70 times.
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.940]   And what Jesus is doing, he's matching his hyperbole.
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.440]   He's not saying 77 times or 490 times.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.900]   He's saying there's no limit to your forgiveness.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:22.740]   When does God stop forgiving you?
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.300]   That's when you should stop forgiving someone else.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:31.640]   Therefore, the kingdom of heaven,
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.540]   now Jesus is gonna tell us what heaven is like.
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.860]   He's gonna speak in a parable.
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.380]   A parable is a story that is told to illustrate a point.
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.520]   That's all it is, a story that's told to illustrate a point.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.360]   So Jesus, he's gonna start preaching
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.540]   and he's using an illustration.
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.480]   He says, "Hey, the kingdom of heaven,
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.360]   "it's like a king who wanted to settle accounts
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.660]   "with his servants.
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.400]   "As he began the settlement,
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.520]   "a man who owed him 10,000 talents was brought to him.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.620]   "Since he was not able to pay,
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.840]   "the master ordered that he and his wife and his children
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.660]   "and all that he had be sold to repay the debt."
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:10.540]   10,000 talents, a talent equals 75 pounds of gold.
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:15.540]   10,000 talents was 150,000 years worth of wages.
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.740]   Jesus is saying, "Hey, there's a servant
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.300]   "who had an impossible debt to pay to a king."
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.300]   A debt equal to $12,500,000,000.
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.780]   That would be today's equivalent of 10,000 talents.
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.580]   12,500,000,000.
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.820]   He's just saying, "Hey, it's an impossible debt.
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:35.940]   "I'll never pay it back."
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.600]   So the king says, "Hey, give me your wife,
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.500]   "give me your children, and give me everything you have,
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:47.340]   "and I'll cancel the debt."
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.740]   The king is angry.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.120]   He has an anger toward this servant.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.340]   And the servant fell on his knees before him.
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.860]   "Be patient with me," he begged.
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.380]   "And I'll pay back everything."
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.140]   No, he can't.
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.540]   What a joke, he can't pay back everything.
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.340]   The servant's master took pity on him,
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.700]   canceled the debt, and let him go.
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.780]   What?
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.040]   Did you hear what just happened?
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:16.500]   Some dude owes a king $12,000,000,000,000,
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.160]   and the king says, "Hey, I'm gonna take your family,
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.900]   "and I'm gonna take all your stuff."
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.820]   And the guy goes, "No, please don't take my stuff.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:23.980]   "Please have mercy on me."
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:28.740]   And he says, "Okay, you got it, I will."
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.980]   And you'd be like, "Man, I'm so glad I asked."
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.900]   Is that not salvation?
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.700]   That every day we're marching against God,
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.500]   that every day we're wanting to be God,
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.900]   every day we're going our own way,
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.180]   we're doing our own thing,
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.060]   and then we come to a place in his mercy
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.340]   where we say, "God, have pity on me.
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.500]   "I know that you sent your son Jesus."
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.880]   And he says, "Okay.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.620]   "Come and have an inheritance with me,
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.980]   "not because of what you've done,
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.300]   "but because of what I've done."
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.420]   My first point this evening is God's anger
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.180]   towards you was canceled.
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.500]   That God was angry.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.100]   He's the king in the story.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.740]   You're the servant in the story.
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.180]   You have an impossible debt to the king,
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.620]   and in a moment, if you've acknowledged Christ,
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.860]   his debt was canceled.
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:19.060]   See, our sin created a huge debt against God.
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.820]   We were created to be in relationship with him.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.260]   So you can just think, right?
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.380]   You were created to live for God's glory.
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.500]   So what is sin?
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.900]   Sin is every moment that you live
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.260]   for anything other than God's glory.
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.500]   Every time you do that, so you can just see, right?
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.620]   I'm tripping over it.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.540]   That time that you thought about yourself too much,
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.140]   that relationship you went too far,
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.620]   and that time you smoked that bowl, snorted that line,
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.940]   got drunk, hugged that toilet, went to the strip club, right?
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.060]   Okay, that you spent your money on you, right?
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:54.260]   You're just racking up all this impossible debt.
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.580]   Every moment, every second, every minute,
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.000]   you'll never pay that debt.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.860]   You can't carry that weight.
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.740]   That's your debt against God.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.620]   You see that?
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:11.300]   Every time the clock ticks,
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:16.180]   and you're living for anything other than his glory,
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.140]   it's sin against him.
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.840]   It's an impossible debt.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:23.840]   It is a hopeless debt that you've created against God.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.540]   You might've seen a video
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:32.700]   or seen that Larry Nassar in the news lately,
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.160]   a serial abuser.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.780]   Many, many coming forward who was a victim
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.620]   to this man who did wicked things,
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.180]   and there was a dad who spoke up in court
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.680]   and just said, "Hey, can I have five minutes with him?
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.220]   I'd love to have my way with him.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.140]   Hey, can I have five minutes?
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.820]   No, okay, judge, one minute.
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.620]   Can I have one minute with him?"
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:57.700]   And the judge says no, and the dad lunges forward
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.680]   to try to have his way to this,
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.660]   with this man who abused three of his daughters.
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.180]   This man abused three of his daughters.
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.700]   This is the rage of a father.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.020]   And we look at that and we're like,
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.460]   man, that guy's my hero.
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.300]   What a wicked man.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.180]   Do you know who you are in that story?
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.560]   You ever abused one of God's daughters?
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.560]   He watched every second of it.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.520]   He says, "Hey, don't go past there."
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.680]   You ever gone on the internet
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.720]   and watched God's daughters naked,
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.480]   God's sons naked performing for you?
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.760]   You ever done that?
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.740]   He saw you.
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:41.960]   And a father, the rage of a father
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.280]   that could come against you,
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.280]   how dare you abuse one of my children in that way?
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.680]   And you were like, "Boy, that was consensual.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.720]   It wasn't okay with her dad.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.600]   It wasn't okay with his father."
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.380]   And so what do we do about it?
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.740]   I want you to understand
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.080]   that your sins are against a holy God.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.640]   David, who slept with Bathsheba
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.240]   and had her husband killed,
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.980]   writes, "Against you alone, oh God,
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.240]   have I sinned."
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.240]   Your sins are against a holy, righteous God.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.920]   And who your sins are against, it really matters.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.000]   I was driving with my daughter this week in the truck
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.640]   and she was asking me just questions,
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.040]   just spit firing me with questions,
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.320]   which are sweet moments as a dad.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.400]   And she said, "Daddy, if somebody walks on our property,
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.440]   is that against the law?"
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.880]   And I said, "Well, if they don't have permission,
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.600]   it's trespassing and it's against the law."
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.240]   And so she goes, "So they go to prison?"
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.100]   Like, that's a little harsh.
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.860]   You know, we probably would just tell them
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.120]   maybe to get off the property
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.580]   or invite them in and share the gospel.
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.740]   I don't know, something.
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:54.740]   And she goes, "So you don't go to prison if you trespass?"
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.700]   And I said, "Well, it depends.
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.140]   It depends who you trespass against.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.380]   See, if somebody trespasses on our yard,
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.940]   I probably get angry.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.380]   You trespass on the president
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.860]   of United States of America's yard,
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:07.940]   you jump the fence, you're dead.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.100]   They kill you.
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.900]   You get shot at, right?
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.620]   Do you see who the offense is against matters.
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.700]   Let me go one more with you.
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.860]   You tell me a lie, I might be angry.
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.520]   You lie to a judge, it's perjury, 10 years in prison.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.940]   You see who the sin is against matters?
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.580]   Your sin is against a holy God,
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.580]   the highest office that is imaginable.
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.860]   Every day you've sinned.
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.940]   You've sinned since you've been sitting here
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.560]   in your thoughts during worship
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.220]   as we're singing praises to God.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:45.220]   You're sinning against the holy God.
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.260]   Where's the hope in that, JP?
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:51.420]   Your sin is bigger than you can imagine,
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.380]   and it costs more than you can pay.
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.460]   And if you don't think so,
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.800]   what you're really saying in your heart
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.500]   is that God wasted his payment.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.380]   If you don't think that you're that big of a sinner,
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.740]   then why did Jesus have to die?
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:12.740]   And so God, he's that angry father.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.820]   He looked at you and despised your sin.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.560]   And so what did he do?
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.580]   He took the weight of your sin,
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:28.060]   and he took his wrath that otherwise would be against you.
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.500]   But if you've acknowledged his payment, right,
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.340]   he comes over here,
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.100]   and he puts it on Christ.
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.340]   (thudding)
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:45.100]   It says in Isaiah that he was pleased
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.660]   to crush the son on your behalf.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:55.940]   Why would a father be pleased to crush his son?
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.820]   Because he loved you.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:03.900]   And when he looks at you, he doesn't see your sin.
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.900]   He sees his payment.
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.460]   Isn't that a beautiful truth?
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.380]   That when he looks at you,
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.020]   he doesn't see the stacks of rocks.
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:19.500]   He sees what he paid for them to purchase you to himself.
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.340]   It says in the scripture,
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.980]   "No longer counting your sins against you."
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:23.840]   Do you feel that?
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:30.900]   That $12,500,000,000 in debt canceled in a moment.
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.220]   Canceled in a moment.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:42.500]   We've sinned more against God than you could imagine,
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.740]   and his grace is so overwhelming
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.380]   that your sin is no match for it.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.180]   It is no appropriate competitor for his grace.
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:54.980]   And so this is how a worldly master in the story,
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.380]   this king releases the dead.
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.860]   Imagine how much more a father who loves you
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.180]   and who controls all things erases your sin.
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.980]   It says in Psalm 103, verse 12,
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.340]   that he's removed them as far as the East is from the West.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.180]   How?
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.700]   By you humbling yourself before him
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.260]   and acknowledging your need for mercy,
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.740]   your need for a savior, he wipes away your debt.
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:15.780]   And here's the deal.
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.140]   You can't pay a debt that's already been paid.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.820]   Okay, if a debt has been paid,
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.940]   you can't go to the bank and say,
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.140]   "Hey, I wanna pay it again."
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.740]   They say, "No, it's already been paid.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.580]   "It's clean."
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.020]   So you can't live your life
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.380]   trying to earn your way back to God
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:33.060]   when he's already erased the debt and said, "You're mine."
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.220]   What are you doing?
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:35.500]   He's paid the debt.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.460]   What are you doing?
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.460]   Do you wanna keep going and racking up the debt?
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.660]   All your debt has been paid past, present, and future.
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.700]   It's been forgiven.
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.500]   And so when God looks at you,
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.940]   he doesn't see your sin, he sees his payment.
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.980]   It says that he delights to show you mercy.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.660]   It's Micah 7, verse 18.
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.420]   "Who is God like you, who pardons sin
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.900]   "and forgives the transgressions
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.300]   "of the remnant of his inheritance?
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.580]   "You do not stay angry forever,
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.700]   "but delight to show mercy."
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:09.540]   How beautiful is that?
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:10.780]   He delights.
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.100]   He takes pleasure in showing you mercy.
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.260]   Let's back to the story.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.220]   But then, so the servant,
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.660]   he's had his debt canceled by the master, by the king.
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.740]   And so he goes out,
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.620]   and he found one of his fellow servants
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.980]   who owed him 100 denarii.
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.100]   And so he's been forgiven $12 billion,
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.660]   but he finds someone who owns him a couple dollars,
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.820]   and he grabbed him and began to choke him.
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.220]   "Pay back what you owe me," he demanded.
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.020]   His fellow servant fell to his knees
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.620]   and begged him, "Be patient with me,
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.740]   "and I will pay you back."
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.820]   See, Jesus is putting in the script.
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.220]   This guy said the same thing that other guy said,
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.580]   and the master forgave him of $12 billion.
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.860]   But this guy, he's angry.
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.420]   He's angry because what's happened to him,
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.620]   it's not fair.
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.580]   It's not fair.
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.140]   It's not something he wanted.
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.180]   It's not something he chose.
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.140]   And he feels that someone's come in
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.860]   and infringed upon his territory,
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.180]   trespassed against him,
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.100]   the sins against him.
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.340]   Now he says, he chokes him.
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:10.080]   "You give me back what you owe me.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.340]   "Pay me back."
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.240]   But he refused.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.580]   The guy asked for mercy, and he refused.
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.020]   Instead, he went off,
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.380]   and he had the man thrown into prison
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.940]   until he could pay the debt.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.480]   When the other servants saw what had happened,
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.320]   those around there, they were like,
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.220]   "Man, this is just confusing."
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.100]   He says they were greatly distressed
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.180]   and went and told their master
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.180]   everything that had happened.
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.220]   That guy that you forgave, $12 billion,
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.620]   he found someone who owed him $100,
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.140]   and he choked him and had him thrown into prison.
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.740]   Master, something's off with that guy.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.500]   It's just confusing.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.620]   My second point is that forgiven people
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.340]   are forgiving people.
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:03.160]   That forgiven people are forgiving people.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.600]   Keep holding your rock.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.500]   Keep thinking of that person
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.780]   who has a debt against you,
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.580]   the one you'd like to choke in the story,
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.660]   the one who did that unspeakable thing to you
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:17.160]   or hurt you, or they did something unjust to you.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.580]   It's a crazy story, but so relevant to 2018
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.180]   that we would forget God's abundant grace towards us
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.820]   and focus more on those who have hurt us.
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.700]   Now, I wanna make some things clear here.
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.880]   Forgiving someone does not mean forgetting
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.620]   what they've done.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:33.540]   That's impossible.
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.820]   Outside of a lumbotomy,
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.020]   literally removing that part of your brain,
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.660]   you can't just erase a memory, okay?
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.180]   And so forgiving someone is not forgetting
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.260]   what they've done to you.
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.920]   It is not also, it's not allowing them
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.460]   to continue to hurt you.
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.420]   That's not loving to anybody.
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.100]   To allow them to continue to act out against you,
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.180]   you may have to create healthy boundaries.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.980]   It's also not just flippantly
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.860]   writing off the wrong and moving forward.
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.460]   That's not what forgiveness is, okay?
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.060]   So what is forgiveness?
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.900]   Here's what it is.
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:03.720]   You ready?
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.560]   Listen.
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.220]   Forgiveness is you taking into true account
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.940]   the damage that they've caused you.
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:14.060]   You looking at the debt that they created.
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.180]   See, their hurt towards you,
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.100]   it caused you a debt.
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.620]   They took something from you.
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.780]   That debt, it could look like, you know,
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.460]   you driving down the road
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.300]   and wasting time thinking about it.
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.740]   It could look like you not being able to function for a day.
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.640]   It could look like a physical injury.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.100]   It could look like any number of things.
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.840]   It could look like years of your life
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.580]   that you look back on and despise
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.380]   because of what they did.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.780]   That's a debt.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.740]   And so you take into true account that debt.
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.020]   You write down that debt.
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.660]   This is what they cost me.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.660]   And forgiveness is saying,
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.460]   and they don't have to pay me back.
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.880]   I'm wiping that debt clean.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.180]   They don't owe me anything.
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.140]   Because you don't win by carrying the bitterness.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.260]   You need to know that.
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.600]   You living the rest of your life angry at them
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.700]   does nothing to them.
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.460]   They say that bitterness is like drinking poison
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.980]   and expecting them to die.
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.460]   You don't win.
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.420]   No one wins.
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:18.000]   So you take into account the hurt that they caused
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.120]   and you acknowledge that it's been paid for.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.180]   About a year ago, Monica and I,
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.460]   we were going on a date.
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.480]   I love date nights.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.360]   Date nights are fun.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.820]   And so she and I, we were driving down a road
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.480]   right by our house, long straightaway road,
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.900]   going the speed limit in the middle lane,
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.560]   just minding our own business, having a conversation.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.540]   And this person turns right in front of us.
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:51.360]   I mean, just right in front of us in the turning lane.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.040]   And they just turned right in front of us.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.200]   And I broadside them, hit them.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.480]   And then we pull into the parking lot
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.260]   of the grocery store right there.
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.860]   And it's a girl.
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:02.840]   And she's on her phone.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:03.960]   Of course she is.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.480]   And so I get out to engage and make sure that she's okay.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.760]   And she's erratic.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.040]   She's going crazy.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.320]   And I know that's an offensive word,
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.520]   but it's the most appropriate word.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.920]   She's going crazy.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.880]   Okay, she's like, "This MF here, this MF here."
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.240]   I mean, lots of curse words, okay?
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.760]   I'm like, "Hey, calm down.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.640]   "You know, you calm down."
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.260]   And she's like, "He came out of nowhere.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.160]   "He came out of nowhere."
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.240]   I was like, "Not really nowhere.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.700]   "I came from my house.
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.160]   "I was driving the speed limit in the same lane.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.080]   "You kind of came right in front of me."
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.800]   And she's like, "He came out of nowhere and just hit me."
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.840]   I was like, "Well, you kind of hit me."
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.520]   And I'm like, "Can we talk?
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.640]   "Do you mind getting off the phone?"
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.480]   And she just like turned around and was like,
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.320]   I was like, "Okay."
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.600]   And so I get in my truck and I call the insurance company.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.120]   And so I'm on the phone with my insurance company
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.840]   and they say, you know, the first thing they ask,
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.240]   does she have insurance?
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.560]   And I rolled down my window, "Do you have insurance?"
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.300]   And she's like, "This is my boyfriend's car.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.560]   "It's my boyfriend's car."
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.560]   I was like, "Oh no."
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.720]   I said, "Hey, it's her boyfriend's car."
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.680]   And so they were like, "Does her boyfriend have insurance?"
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.520]   Roll it down.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.880]   "Hey, does your boyfriend have insurance?"
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.120]   And she didn't wanna talk.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.880]   And so I'm keep going with the insurance company
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.880]   and Monica's calling the police and the boyfriend comes.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.360]   And I thought she was crazy.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.480]   No, this dude was crazy.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.760]   He gets there and he falls to the ground
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.200]   and starts punching the concrete.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.640]   And he's yelling, like crazy yelling, lots of words.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.800]   I'm learning nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.080]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.240]   And I'm on the phone with the insurance
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:53.680]   and he comes to my truck window and he goes,
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.480]   "Get the F out of the car!"
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:02.160]   Did you hear that?
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.680]   Yeah, what was that?
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.580]   Do you need to go?
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.620]   I think I need to go.
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.220]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:16.220]   So I get out of my truck and yeah, that was foolish.
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:20.140]   He's a little guy.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.780]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.260]   Yeah, you were picturing a big guy.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.220]   He had a lot of anger.
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:31.380]   Why are you yelling at me?
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.260]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.420]   Why are you doing that?
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.820]   And he's like, "You're gonna tell the police
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.380]   "that I was driving that car."
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:45.780]   I was like, "Let me tell you why that's not gonna happen.
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.980]   "And I need to let you know that you hurt me
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.420]   "with your words in front of my wife
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.340]   "and the anger that you displayed."
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:30:00.860]   And he's like, "I'm sorry."
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.740]   I was like, "That's good, thank you."
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.420]   You know, your girlfriend really pulled in front of us
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.940]   and he was like, "Well, it doesn't matter whose fault it is."
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.580]   I was like, "It kind of matters."
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.220]   'Cause let me show you why, come here.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.740]   You see that damage?
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:22.540]   Somebody's gotta pay for that, right?
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:27.540]   You caused some damage and someone has to pay for that.
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:32.780]   This is an auditing of the transgression, if you will.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.780]   I'm happy to forgive you for the hurt
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.940]   that you caused with your words earlier.
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.220]   Let me ask you a question, do you have a faith?
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.860]   He said, "Yeah, I'm a Christian."
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.660]   I said, "That is so confusing."
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.820]   Let me tell you, sir, why that is so confusing.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:52.260]   There is nothing in your life right now
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.620]   that remotely resembles Jesus
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.380]   in the way that you're handling this situation.
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.380]   And so if you're saying you believe in a God,
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.260]   listen, let me tell you, we can trust him in this moment.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.060]   Okay, and it was sweet, we got to pray
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.660]   and got to talk through the gospel
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:09.140]   and around why that was so confusing.
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:14.140]   But what happened was their insurance company intervened
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.760]   and paid for the damage.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.780]   And see, what happened is Christ has intervened
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.260]   and he's paid for the damage.
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.780]   That's true, for God so loved the what?
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.280]   The world, the cosmos.
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.260]   Even the person that hurt you,
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.660]   and I know that might be hard to hear right now.
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.060]   God loves that person.
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:41.900]   And when Christ died, he paid a payment
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:46.300]   that they need to acknowledge, they need to accept.
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:51.100]   But he died for them too and he died for you.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.860]   He canceled your $12 billion and their $12 billion.
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:59.020]   And so when we have that, right?
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.740]   We are able, when we understand how we've been forgiven,
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.460]   we forgive others.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.660]   And so I know right about now,
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.380]   you're like, can I ever be angry?
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:12.620]   Listen, anger in and of itself is an unproductive emotion.
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.260]   You take your anger and you figure out
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:16.740]   what you need to do because of it.
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:20.140]   Is there an injustice that you need to act upon?
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.540]   Is there someone you need to forgive?
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.860]   Anger in and of itself, it's only killing you.
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.900]   I told you about the health, how it affects your health.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.860]   It's only hurting you.
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.580]   You need to figure out what you need to do with your anger.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.300]   It's simply an unproductive emotion.
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:43.020]   And so what happens when you carry it around
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.540]   is it shows up at really inopportune times,
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.220]   like car wrecks or when your boss says something
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.940]   you don't agree with, a relationship that goes sideways,
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.500]   and that anger that you're actually carrying
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.020]   towards someone else, it shows up.
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:57.980]   My friend Allie would talk about
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.980]   how she was carrying those rocks in her purse
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.700]   and she'd be at dinner and she'd reach in her purse
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.220]   to grab something, she'd pull out a rock
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.100]   and then she'd have to explain to everybody
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.060]   why she had rocks in her purse.
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.780]   And that's what anger does, is it shows up
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.520]   at really inopportune times in our life.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.420]   It rears its head.
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:14.900]   Can I tell you something?
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.980]   You don't wanna marry someone who's angry
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:21.020]   because what's gonna happen is you're gonna be
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.980]   the target of that anger at some point.
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.340]   Okay, they're gonna take that anger out on you.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:30.300]   And so I hate the stories, some of the stories
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.140]   that have been written on your lives.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:36.500]   The abandonment, the hurt, the abuse,
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:40.320]   I truly, I hear them over and over and over all the time.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.260]   God hates it.
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:49.460]   But you have something to do now with it.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.140]   You've gotta figure out what you're going to do with it.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.820]   It's only hurting you.
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.180]   Like that guy that was exploding with anger
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:00.500]   outside my truck, that's not like a one-time thing.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.700]   That's something that marked his life.
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:05.060]   That was a pattern that showed up in that moment
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.100]   'cause he carried it.
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:10.940]   Verse 32, "Then the master called the servant in."
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.020]   So now the king's talking again, okay?
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.780]   The servant went and said, hey, that guy that you forgave,
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:19.300]   $12 billion, he wouldn't forgive somebody $100.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:20.540]   He had him thrown into prison.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.260]   And so the king shows up now and he says,
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.020]   you wicked servant, he said,
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:28.300]   I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.900]   Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servants
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.140]   just as I had on you?
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:34.200]   Why would Jesus be telling us this story?
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.700]   Why would God preserve this for thousands of years
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.980]   that we might read it this evening?
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.900]   I forgave you of your debt.
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.980]   Shouldn't you forgive them of their debt?
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.380]   In anger, his master turned him over
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.300]   to the jailers to be tortured.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.680]   The Greek there is literally,
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:56.540]   he was handed over to the torturers
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.740]   until he should pay back all he owed, which is impossible.
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:01.900]   That would take eternity, forever.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.940]   And then Jesus says this,
[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:05.860]   this really controversial statement.
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:10.340]   Listen, listen, this is how my heavenly Father
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.000]   will treat each of you
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.020]   unless you forgive your brother from your heart.
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:19.140]   Okay, he says that he threw him in to be tortured
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.220]   until his debt was paid, that's forever.
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.860]   This is a clear allusion to hell.
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:27.340]   God is the master, we are the servants.
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.780]   God has forgiven us of an impossible debt.
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.920]   We don't forgive others of their minor debts against us
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.620]   that may not feel minor, but they're in this world offenses.
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:42.500]   And he says, you don't understand how you've been forgiven.
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.500]   And so where is God's wrath going to be satisfied?
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.060]   It was satisfied on the cross,
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:51.920]   or it will be satisfied in eternity.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:58.180]   So why, why would we continue to be angry
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:59.620]   when we say we are forgiven,
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.420]   but we don't act as forgiven people?
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:03.820]   We choke people with our words, our actions,
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.520]   or the hate in our heart, or just what we feel.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.780]   It's confusing to a watching world.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:10.540]   It belittles the gospel.
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.380]   And so it says, it almost says, does it not say like,
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.660]   hey, if you don't forgive others that you're not forgiven,
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:17.260]   doesn't it seem to say that?
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.380]   But it's probably just some weird text, right,
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.180]   that if we get into the Greek,
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.280]   it really means something else.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.180]   Let's just look at a few others, okay?
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.500]   Matthew 6, verse 14 through 15.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.020]   For if you forgive men when they sin against you,
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.220]   your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.280]   But if you do not forgive men their sins,
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.380]   your Father will not forgive your sins.
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.520]   We can go Mark 11.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.680]   And when you stand praying,
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.780]   if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him,
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:43.900]   so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.620]   Ephesians 4, be kind and compassionate to one another,
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.740]   forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.740]   Colossians 3, bear with each other
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.460]   and forgive whatever grievances
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.140]   you may have against one another.
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.040]   Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.820]   Luke 6, but I want you to love your enemies
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.420]   and do good to them.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:05.180]   Verse 36, be merciful just as your Father is merciful.
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.740]   Do not judge and you will not be judged.
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.740]   Do not condemn and you will not be condemned.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.420]   Forgive and you will be forgiven.
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:12.860]   And so you hear all of that.
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.660]   And some of you may be really confused
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.540]   and you're like, is this works-based salvation,
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.860]   Lordship salvation?
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.100]   Are you saying the gospel plus something else?
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.860]   And I'm saying, no, no, no, no.
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:25.020]   I believe with all my heart, what God is teaching here
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:27.420]   is that when you understand the forgiveness
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:30.900]   that he has given you freely through his Son,
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.620]   you did nothing for it.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:35.320]   When you really get it, you pass it on.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.420]   And when you cannot give it to someone else,
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.820]   you may have to go back to the beginning and say,
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.780]   okay, did I really receive it from God?
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:48.940]   Did I truly acknowledge God's payment for my sins?
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.860]   Do I fully understand that 2018 years ago,
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.260]   God became a man in the form of Jesus Christ,
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.620]   lived a perfect life, the most notorious individual ever
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.100]   to walk on the planet, more books had been sold
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.740]   in his honor than any other books
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.140]   that have ever been written.
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:10.780]   And he died for you and he erased your sins.
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:15.020]   And he came back from the grave, making him world famous.
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:18.540]   Someone that people would talk about.
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:21.640]   Our forgiveness of others is evidence
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.300]   of a right understanding of God's forgiveness of us.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:29.340]   We love God not because of what he might do for us,
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.620]   that's superstitious.
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.540]   If you're here, kind of leveraging,
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.680]   well, if I go to the porch, then maybe I'll get that job
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.560]   or maybe he'll ask me out.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.100]   It's karma, guys.
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.860]   That's another religion, okay?
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.780]   I hope you're here because of what God
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.200]   has already done for you.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.860]   He sent his son, Jesus Christ, to die for my sins
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:50.940]   and raise him from the dead.
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:54.220]   And by that, I'm healed, I'm forgiven, I'm set free.
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.820]   See my friend Allie, we were on that boat
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.420]   and she got this, like in the middle of the trip,
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:03.180]   she got it and she went onto the roof of that boat
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.980]   and in the middle of the Amazon, she grabbed those rocks
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:10.980]   and she said, "Forgiven, forgiven, forgiven."
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:14.540]   And she starts throwing them in the Amazon River.
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.140]   And then in a way that God would write a story
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:21.020]   so beautifully, we climbed down from the roof of that boat
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:24.900]   and we went into that same water and she got baptized.
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.620]   We have a picture.
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:28.420]   She was baptized in that very water,
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.420]   symbolizing that she had been buried with Christ,
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.420]   that her sins had been buried with Christ
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.860]   and she would raise up as a new creation
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:39.620]   that God had forgiven her.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.440]   It's a story only God can write.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.460]   And so your forgiveness, my third point,
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.060]   demonstrates God's forgiveness.
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:50.200]   Your forgiveness demonstrates God's forgiveness.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.220]   It displays God's forgiveness.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:56.020]   He desires to make himself known
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:59.900]   and he does this through each of you.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.100]   It's why you live, why there's breath in your lungs,
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.780]   why your heart beats in your chest.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:05.460]   It's not to make much of you,
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.780]   see how much fun you can have in this life.
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.220]   What you can experience is to live for his glory.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:14.900]   And so when you leave here, you have an opportunity.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.740]   You're gonna walk through those doors.
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.340]   And through those doors are tubs
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.280]   and you can make a choice.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:27.020]   That rock, it can be a burden that you carry with you
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.000]   into tomorrow.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.700]   You sleep with it by your side, put it under your pillow,
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:33.260]   you carry it everywhere you go,
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.340]   in your pocket, in your purse.
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.820]   You can have it tomorrow.
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.460]   Okay, you can have it the next day.
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.700]   You can continue to carry that.
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:45.140]   Or when you leave here and you pass that tub,
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:47.840]   you can drop it and say the word forgiven.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.860]   I forgive you.
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.980]   I'm releasing this debt.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.500]   But as you hold that rock right now,
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.780]   I want you to count the cost.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:59.300]   I want you to consider what they cost you.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.220]   I want you to take a true inventory
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.380]   of the bitterness that you've carried
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:07.060]   or whatever the infraction cost you,
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.220]   whatever the transgression,
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:11.180]   whatever the trespass has cost you.
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:14.300]   And you choose when you leave here
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.120]   if you're going to release that, wipe that debt clean,
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.780]   or if you're gonna continue to carry that debt against them.
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.020]   It's your choice.
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.440]   You can make that choice.
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.780]   I want you to know that God's anger against you
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.260]   was satisfied in Christ.
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:34.820]   In summary, as forgiven people, we are forgiving people.
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:38.020]   And that our forgiveness demonstrates God's forgiveness.
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:42.080]   I know that some of you are carrying some big rocks.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.280]   They wouldn't fit in that bag right there.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.220]   I want you to know that God desires
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:50.860]   to make himself known through your forgiveness.
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:55.140]   And I know that sometimes your anger,
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:42:00.140]   it comes out of a fear that what happened might happen again
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:04.740]   or it comes out of love that you have something
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:08.300]   that you love so much that it was removed from you
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.820]   that it brings up as anger,
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.380]   comes up in your life as anger.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:20.920]   I want you to know that Jesus takes away your excuse.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:24.500]   When they hurled insults at him,
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.840]   he did not retaliate.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.940]   When they spit on him, he didn't spit back.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:33.500]   When they insulted him, he did not shout back at them,
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.900]   but he humbled himself.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.220]   Says, "For the joy set before him, he endured the cross."
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.060]   For you.
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.380]   For you.
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:45.260]   He was publicly tortured and humiliated.
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.780]   You know the last thing he did before he died
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:48.620]   in his ministry?
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.080]   You know the last thing he did?
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:53.200]   Forgive them, Father.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.920]   For they know not what they do.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:59.000]   He modeled that for us.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.160]   And maybe you would say, yeah, but that's Jesus.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:06.480]   I get to see incredible examples of forgiveness
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.720]   all the time, amazing examples of forgiveness.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:15.440]   And so for you women, maybe your worst nightmare,
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.400]   the worst thing that you can imagine
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.720]   is that a man would break into your home,
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.360]   a strange man you don't know.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.120]   And that he would take something from you,
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:29.400]   that he would abuse you, that he would forcefully rape you,
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.200]   maybe taking your virginity from you.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.200]   And you think, how?
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.600]   But then in that moment, I'm justified, right?
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.220]   I don't have to forgive him, right?
[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:41.680]   I want you to watch my friend Rachel's story.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.900]   (gentle music)
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:49.240]   (gentle music)
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:57.700]   On a Friday night, I was just coming home from work,
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:01.420]   was home by myself and started getting ready for bed,
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:04.980]   was taking a shower, and I heard just some noise.
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.580]   It was through my window in my bedroom.
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:15.380]   I turned off the water, and when I came back up
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.780]   on the left side, there was this strange man
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.460]   just standing right next to me.
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:23.580]   He was there to rape me, to sexually assault me.
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:26.020]   And I just had just this moment of panic,
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.940]   and I was scared to death.
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.660]   I wanted to see if I could maybe convince him to stop.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.720]   It's my first time.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:37.960]   I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.660]   I just kept saying that and saying that,
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:43.960]   hoping that he would stop, and he didn't.
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.540]   (gentle music)
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:53.240]   It happened in worst, worst moment of my life.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:59.480]   He left, immediately called my roommate in panic
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:02.800]   and just said, "You need to call 911 'cause I can't do it."
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:08.460]   About a couple weeks later, the police called me
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:12.240]   and said that they had somebody in custody,
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.440]   and to come in, I saw his face.
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.360]   And that was the first time since that night
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.560]   that I'd even seen a picture of him.
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.720]   The monster that I had in my head
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.320]   wasn't what I was seeing right in front of me.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.960]   He decided to plead guilty for the rape.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.280]   I became more hateful towards him
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:38.280]   because now I was seeing the product of what he had done.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.880]   After the rape, I considered myself damaged,
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:49.800]   unworthy of a man's love in the future, just a sad person.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:54.120]   All the precious things that I had held
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:58.040]   for so long in my life, he took that all from me,
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:02.560]   and I just started to see my future just going up in flames.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:05.500]   I couldn't be whole again.
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.640]   It frustrated me that he could have such a hold
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.520]   on my life and how I felt.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.380]   Why me?
[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:14.600]   Why did I have to go through this?
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.000]   It was such a weight on my shoulders,
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.920]   and I just fell apart.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.800]   I needed to do something
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.380]   because I knew that forgiveness needed to happen.
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:29.280]   It seemed so daunting, and it seemed so heart-wrenching.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.320]   When I was walking through,
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.960]   I just thought maybe I would get an out.
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.600]   Like, I don't have to forgive this guy.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.680]   He's done the worst of the worst.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.400]   I had just never thought of forgiveness as a benefit to me.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.320]   It's really hard to know the extent
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.440]   of what God does for us through forgiving us
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.440]   until you go through something like this.
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.320]   It just changes your thought on what forgiveness looks like.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.880]   God has been softening my heart since that day,
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:54.520]   and even through my breakdowns,
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.700]   even in my times where I just yell at him
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.720]   and just get mad at him, what he's allowed in my life,
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.840]   and he's still bigger than all of that.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.060]   He has been with me this entire way.
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:08.500]   I'm letting him heal every part of me
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.180]   that was broken that night.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.580]   I feel joy.
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:13.740]   I feel incredible love when I shouldn't,
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.500]   and that is total surrender,
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.900]   and I have to do it every single day.
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:22.180]   Christ forgave me of my sins.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:25.780]   If he can do that, I can do that for one man,
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:27.640]   and that is enough to stand on.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:34.460]   - I want you to meet a hero of mine, Rachel Duncan.
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:38.300]   (congregation applauds)
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:46.740]   I want you to know, and Rachel, you don't know this,
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:48.500]   but I think about you all the time.
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:55.900]   There are times in my life where I feel
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.660]   like someone has hurt me,
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:01.100]   and I feel justified in my anger toward them.
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.480]   I think about revenge, and I think about,
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.740]   hey, how do I wanna get even?
[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:07.860]   I think about you, and I think about
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:09.820]   your example of forgiveness,
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.380]   and the way that that has been displayed in your life.
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:13.900]   I think about the community of friends
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:15.540]   that God has raised up around you.
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:18.460]   I want you to know you're one of my heroes.
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.780]   I wanna thank you that you would allow us
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.660]   to share your story here.
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.340]   I just wanna ask, would you close us out in prayer?
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:29.000]   - God, Heavenly Father,
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.100]   just thank you for who you are,
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.740]   for how much you love us,
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.580]   and have forgiven us of our sin, God,
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:44.580]   and you took away our debt through your son, Jesus.
[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:49.860]   And man, it is good to just reflect on that
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.460]   and remind ourselves daily of how much
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:57.460]   we have been given in you and your son.
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:59.240]   God, just thank you for this message,
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:03.440]   for reminding us of who we are.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.300]   We are followers of Christ.
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:10.300]   We are called to live more like Jesus,
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.860]   and that includes forgiveness.
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.380]   It's not easy.
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.600]   It's difficult.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.960]   It can be overwhelming sometimes, Lord,
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:24.960]   but gosh, there is freedom when we are able to forgive
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:28.440]   and to trust you and to surrender it
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:30.200]   all at the foot of the cross.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:34.240]   And I pray that, man, everybody in this building,
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.400]   everybody in this church,
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.320]   everybody listening online, God,
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:40.200]   tonight would just, would surrender it all,
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:44.940]   would give you the glory by just forgiving
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:48.400]   those that have hurt us, that have wronged us,
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:53.140]   and even asking for forgiveness ourselves
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:56.820]   and reconciling with our brothers and sisters in Christ, God.
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:00.640]   I just pray that these young adults
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.840]   would be a light in this city,
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.600]   that they would do something different,
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:09.560]   that they would radically give their lives to the Lord,
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:12.640]   and that you would give them the power
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:16.880]   and the strength to forgive the unforgivable.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:21.320]   You did it with us, and I pray that these people,
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:25.680]   these young adults, all of us, God, would do the same.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.260]   Just thank you for your son, Jesus,
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.480]   what he did on the cross,
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:32.100]   and I pray these things in his name, amen.
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:33.700]   - Amen, thank you, friend.
