1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 What's up guys, David and JD here.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,000
 What up?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 And The Porch 2022 is back.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,100
 We're back, baby.

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:07,600
 That's right.

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,100
 And we are kicking off a brand new series.

7
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,200
 Speaking of babies.

8
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,000
 Oh, that's right.

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,200
 Oh, you had a baby.

10
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
 That's correct.

11
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,600
 Which is why you're hearing from us at the beginning of this podcast.

12
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,100
 Mm-hmm.

13
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,400
 And I am not at The Porch this Tuesday.

14
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,100
 So sad.

15
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,600
 I know.

16
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,600
 Because we missed you.

17
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,100
 We were in the hospital.

18
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,100
 And I know this is...

19
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,000
 We missed you.

20
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,600
 This is sad to miss the first kickoff I've ever missed.

21
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,900
 But it was an amazing night.

22
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,900
 Amazing night.

23
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,200
 And Josiah Jones brought the gospel.

24
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,500
 We're kicking off a new series.

25
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,100
 RIP to the old me living the new life in Christ.

26
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,600
 And last night he talked about...

27
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,400
 Yeah, well, we just want to make sure, hey, before we get to what it looks like to live a new life in Christ,

28
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,800
 have you died to your old self?

29
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,300
 Yes.

30
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,500
 And so it was very just, I mean, an amazing night together.

31
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,900
 And we want you guys to listen.

32
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,000
 Just have some context.

33
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,900
 Because we know it didn't start off with the normal bumper and music and all of that.

34
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,400
 Yeah.

35
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,100
 You got us.

36
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,200
 So we're so pumped.

37
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,900
 Check it out.

38
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,300
 Listen.

39
00:00:59,300 --> 00:00:59,800
 Enjoy it.

40
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,300
 And we'll see you next week as we kick off a brand new series.

41
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,000
 RIP to the old me.

42
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,600
 Good to be back at the porch.

43
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,500
 My name is Josiah.

44
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,100
 If we haven't met, I hope to meet you over the course of the next few weeks.

45
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:19,300
 And I get to spend a few minutes with you tonight as we just stay in this moment and as we continue to worship Jesus,

46
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,300
 not only in song, but now as we open up his word.

47
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,200
 And so let me just pray one more time as we get ready to hear from him.

48
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:36,300
 God in heaven, thank you for this opportunity where we get to open up your word and we get to hear what you would have to say.

49
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,700
 And so, God, get me out of the way.

50
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,600
 May your voice be maximized in this place and may my voice be minimized.

51
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:55,200
 God, thank you for what you're doing all across Dallas, Texas and our nation, this world, the people watching tonight,

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,500
 God, all across America, God, literally.

53
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:13,000
 Porch Live locations in Cincinnati and Boise, Idaho and Tulsa, Oklahoma and Austin, Texas and North Houston.

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,800
 God, you are at work and for the very first time, the Porch Live Midland, Texas and many others I failed to mention.

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
 God, would you speak?

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,500
 Would you go before us in Jesus' name?

57
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,300
 Amen.

58
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:35,400
 Well, as JD mentioned earlier, we are going to be starting a brand new series next week titled RIP to the Old Me.

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:46,200
 And it's this idea that we're going to tackle just a few things that God asks us to walk away from after we commit our life to him.

60
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,400
 It's this idea that, man, when we commit to Jesus, when we say, Jesus, you're mine and I want you,

61
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,200
 then God begins to come in and he begins to transform us from the inside out.

62
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,200
 And I believe that that's what he's doing in this moment and in the next few moments.

63
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:16,300
 But before we can even ask God to transform us, we got to ask God and examine where we are with him.

64
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,900
 We got to ask that question tonight.

65
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,600
 God, where am I with you in relation to you?

66
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,900
 Before we can rest in peace to the person we once were,

67
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:36,500
 we have to begin to ask first and foremost and evaluate where are we with Christ?

68
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,700
 Where are we with Jesus?

69
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,100
 Before Christ can change us, we got to make sure that we have a right relationship with him.

70
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,800
 You might be asking, what does that even look like?

71
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,700
 For me, it started when I was a kid.

72
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,700
 I kind of heard this idea of having a relationship with Jesus.

73
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:02,800
 But then at a young age, my parents divorced and it was like a bomb was dropped in our living room.

74
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,400
 And then my life began to spiral and unravel just out of control.

75
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,700
 And women drove my need for approval, sports drove my need for success,

76
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,900
 pornography kept calling my name behind closed doors.

77
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,500
 The party consumed me on the weekend.

78
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,900
 Before I knew it, I was drowning.

79
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:33,800
 I had all the freedom of a college student leaving for college one afternoon,

80
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,600
 getting in my car, and had all the freedom of a college student,

81
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,300
 but not the maturity to go with it.

82
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,700
 Ever been there?

83
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,900
 And all those things I just mentioned began to intensify.

84
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,800
 Playing college baseball.

85
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,500
 And I remember vividly my third year of college, getting off the bus after playing a game

86
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,000
 and heading to my apartment that night and my roommates,

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,700
 who also my teammates were getting ready to go out to the party.

88
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,300
 And I just said, hey, I'm taking this one off.

89
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,800
 Why? Because I kept asking myself the question, is that it?

90
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,600
 Because if these things weren't going to do it anymore, what was going to do it?

91
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,500
 I just went right down the list with everything I'd been filling my life with.

92
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,300
 The things I just mentioned.

93
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:28,600
 And that evening in my apartment, I just said, God, I'm done.

94
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,900
 I'm done.

95
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,200
 I can't do this anymore.

96
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,400
 From the outside, people would think, man, this guy has it all.

97
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:46,300
 Playing the sport he loves, dating the girl that, quite frankly, everybody wanted.

98
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,300
 The life of the party.

99
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,400
 But it left me empty and unsatisfied and unfulfilled.

100
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,400
 And that night I began to see my sin for the very first time.

101
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,500
 That it was leading to death.

102
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,100
 It was leading to heartache and it was leading to pain.

103
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:16,900
 Proverbs 14, 12 says, there's a way that seems right to man, but that way ends in death.

104
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:26,200
 The Bible says in Romans 6, 23, for the wages of sin is death.

105
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,500
 Spiritually, the Bible says that we're dead.

106
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,700
 We're cut off from Christ, from our Creator, and destined for hell for all of eternity.

107
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,800
 Not because God doesn't love us, but because God can't have anything to do with sin.

108
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,000
 Because he's holy.

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,600
 That just means he's perfect.

110
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,500
 He's without sin.

111
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,100
 And in the beginning, he created the heavens and the earth, and he created to be perfect.

112
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,800
 But because he didn't want to force his love on man, he gave them a choice.

113
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,300
 And what did man do in that moment?

114
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,100
 He rebelled against God and sin entered the world and it sent creation into chaos.

115
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:07,500
 So therefore, we see pain.

116
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,500
 We're a product of pain.

117
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:18,600
 Divorce, murder, rape, disease, COVID.

118
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,200
 See, all those things are a result of sin.

119
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:31,000
 Not because God is a bad God or he doesn't know what he's doing, but it's because the world's out of control right now.

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,300
 And I'm looking at some of you as I share this.

121
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:39,000
 And just like me, if you continue to live in that thing that the Bible calls sin, it will kill you.

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Maybe not physically right now, but spiritually, you're cut off.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,100
 You're separated.

124
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,300
 You've got God on one side and he's perfect.

125
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:54,300
 And then you've got you and me on another side and we're not.

126
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,500
 And you know this.

127
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:06,500
 Deep down inside, when you lay your head down on the pillow as I did for many days before that night in my apartment, you know this to be true.

128
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,600
 That the sin isn't leading to more and more life and it's not leading to flourishing.

129
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,300
 It's actually leading to more and more pain and heartbreak.

130
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:20,600
 And if you're to be honest, death.

131
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,000
 Google 2021 urine review video.

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 I don't know if you watch that.

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,700
 I like watching those at the end of the year.

134
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:33,900
 And it went on to say the question that was searched the most on Google, you want to know what it was?

135
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,100
 How to heal.

136
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,600
 How to heal.

137
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,700
 Like we know that something is wrong, something is broken, something is not right.

138
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:51,400
 We know that we need healing.

139
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,700
 Romans 3.23 says for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.

140
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,000
 There is none righteous, no not one, including the guy that's up on stage right now.

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,700
 The glory of God is his perfection.

142
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,500
 That's his standard.

143
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,600
 And none of us are perfect.

144
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,900
 I haven't met one person that is.

145
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:17,100
 But the second part of Romans 6.23 says right before, for the wages of sin is death.

146
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:27,600
 It says but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

147
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,800
 Romans 5.8 says while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

148
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,400
 Like he didn't wait for us to clean our life up and then die for us.

149
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,600
 It says while we were yet sinners, he knew everything you and I would do in thought, word, and action.

150
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,500
 Way before we were ever in our mother's womb.

151
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,200
 And he says I see that and I'm going to die for that.

152
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,200
 That's crazy.

153
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,300
 Because he loves you.

154
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,000
 He's crazy about you.

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,400
 For God so loved the world that he gave his one only son.

156
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,500
 That whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life.

157
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,100
 Put your name where it says world.

158
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,900
 For God so loved Katie.

159
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,200
 For God so loved John.

160
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,300
 For God so loved JD.

161
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,200
 For God so loved Ramsey.

162
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,600
 For God so loved David.

163
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,400
 For God so loved Josiah.

164
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,300
 That he gave his one only son.

165
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:34,000
 That whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life.

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,700
 Romans 10.9 and 10.

167
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:42,500
 The response to what Jesus has done for you and me.

168
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,000
 That Jesus didn't just die the scripture says.

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,300
 History records that three days later he rose again from the dead.

170
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,200
 As an anthem of saying I defeated that thing that put me on the cross.

171
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,500
 Sin.

172
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
 And I defeated the grave.

173
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,700
 So that you can too.

174
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,400
 And now the response.

175
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,900
 How do we know if we're right with God?

176
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:16,300
 How do we respond to this incredible rescue mission that God sent his only son on?

177
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,000
 Says it right here.

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,700
 If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord.

179
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,600
 That he is who he says he is.

180
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,400
 And believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead.

181
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,700
 You will be saved.

182
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,300
 For with the heart a person believes and is justified.

183
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,900
 And with the mouth one confesses and is saved.

184
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,500
 See some of you you've trusted Jesus to be real.

185
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,800
 But you've never truly surrendered your entire life to him.

186
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,200
 You want to trust Jesus with your eternity.

187
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,500
 But you don't really want to trust him with your sin.

188
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,100
 Now I've been there.

189
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,600
 I get it.

190
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,900
 But tonight's the night that you can do that.

191
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:17,500
 You know deep down that it's not going to end well for you.

192
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:23,300
 That God's written eternity on the hearts of every man and every woman.

193
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:29,100
 And God has done the only act that can make us right with him.

194
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,200
 What he's done on the cross and through his resurrection.

195
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,900
 And he says the ball's in your court.

196
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,900
 Tonight's the night that you give your life to Christ.

197
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,100
 Tonight's the night that you surrender once and for all.

198
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,500
 If that's you, that's your next step.

199
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,600
 What I'm about to say next, like you don't even need to hear it.

200
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,500
 Like you just need to stay there right there where you are seated.

201
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,400
 And you say, hey, I'm going to wait for the opportunity.

202
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,300
 Because tonight's the night.

203
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,500
 I'm going to, I'm crossing the line.

204
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:08,800
 I'm getting out of death and I'm going to receive life.

205
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,200
 But for others, man, we've been to the porch time and time again.

206
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,300
 And we keep rehashing what was buried.

207
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,100
 You know that thing that you said you'd never go back to?

208
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,500
 Because Jesus died for it, but instead you find yourself picking it back up.

209
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,300
 Even though Jesus has freed you from it.

210
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:34,000
 You thought it was buried, but now it's beginning to bury you.

211
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:42,200
 It's kind of like, I liken it to this casket.

212
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:50,700
 This casket is a symbol of death.

213
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:57,400
 The purpose of this casket is to bury dead people.

214
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:03,200
 Now that's morbid, but sit in it for a second.

215
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,600
 You never see a casket really dug back up.

216
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,900
 And if you do, like something went terribly wrong.

217
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,200
 And like Jesus is saying tonight that, hey, when I went to the cross,

218
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,400
 I took upon all your sin, all of my sin was put in the grave.

219
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,500
 It was buried.

220
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:28,700
 I died for it.

221
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,300
 And when he rose again, he showed the world that he not only died for it,

222
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,000
 but he defeated it.

223
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,200
 But some of us, man, we're not living with that freedom because we keep digging things

224
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,700
 out that we thought we buried.

225
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,500
 I don't know what that is for you.

226
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,500
 Tonight, I don't know what that is for you, but you do.

227
00:14:50,500 --> 00:15:00,000
 Maybe it's your achievement.

228
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:09,900
 Maybe it's the things that are in your life that symbolize achievement.

229
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,300
 Like you look at a trophy and you're like, hey, it started really young when you were

230
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,400
 on the sports field or you were in the academic realm.

231
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,000
 And, I mean, you just chased one accolade after another.

232
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,100
 And it just kind of moved as you graduated and went on to different seasons of life.

233
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,200
 Now you have that job.

234
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,400
 And, I mean, now you're just building the resume.

235
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,600
 It's just performance after performance after performance, and you're chasing money,

236
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,300
 the next tax bracket.

237
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,300
 And then it's the car, and then it's the apartment, and then it's the, quite frankly,

238
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,700
 it's the zip code.

239
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,700
 And listen, none of those things are bad in and of themselves.

240
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,200
 But you know that they're consuming you.

241
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,500
 And you know you run back to them to find purpose and meaning and to define you.

242
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,200
 And you know at the end of the day, it's keeping you from having a thriving relationship

243
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,000
 with Jesus because I've been there.

244
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,600
 I've chased it.

245
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,700
 It just keeps you busy.

246
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,400
 And you never really take next steps in your faith, and you don't get into community,

247
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,700
 and you don't ever serve.

248
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,900
 And it's just the next thing after the next thing after the next thing.

249
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,000
 Let me just tell you something.

250
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,300
 If you're too busy to be a Christian, then you're too busy.

251
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:30,100
 And as you're examining what you want to commit to in 2022, ask yourself, at what cost?

252
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,700
 At what cost?

253
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,300
 See, for some of you, it's not performance or achievement.

254
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,200
 And it's broken relationships.

255
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:47,700
 And so every time you look at a picture of your family, it just reminds you of the brokenness,

256
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:53,800
 that divorce that your parents had.

257
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,300
 Your daddy ran out on you.

258
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,800
 He was never the man that you needed him to be.

259
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:07,900
 And so you pursue in relationships with other men and other women who give you one false

260
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:14,100
 promise after another only to lead you to more brokenness, and your heart is just trashed,

261
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:20,800
 if you had to be honest tonight.

262
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:27,400
 Broken relationships is what you rehash, what you dig back up, the pain in the hurt associated

263
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
 with that.

264
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,960
 And for some of you, it's not broken relationships, it's comparison.

265
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:40,500
 After a long day at work, you get on social media and you just start scrolling.

266
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,720
 And you just start comparing your life to that girl who just seems to have it all together.

267
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,000
 She's got the next thing, and she's going here, it's like, "Hawaii again?

268
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,340
 Good night.

269
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,080
 I can't even get out of Texas."

270
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,480
 You know what I mean?

271
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,640
 And you're like, "That guy at the gym, he's getting his gains, and whenever he gets his

272
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,680
 — he's always got that girl next to him."

273
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,480
 It's like, "Come on."

274
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:14,940
 And then the body image, and you're comparing yourself to that person, and it's just leading

275
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,840
 you to more and more brokenness, more and more depression, more and more anxiety.

276
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:26,160
 And it's keeping you from being God's man, God's woman.

277
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,000
 You keep rehashing it.

278
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,560
 For others, it's addiction.

279
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,240
 These chains, they symbolize the addictions that we have in our life.

280
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,160
 You know what they are.

281
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,240
 I was a porn addict for a decade of my life.

282
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,480
 The thing you did this past weekend, the one-night stand you had, you drank too much, you smoked

283
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,080
 that, you took those pills, because you're trying to numb the thing that you need to

284
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,240
 deal with.

285
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,180
 And you're running from one thing to the next, just hoping that it'll give you some type

286
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,200
 of reprieve.

287
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:16,440
 But all it does is lead you to more and more addiction.

288
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,460
 And you're bound.

289
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,320
 You know you're bound.

290
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:31,800
 And you can't get out, because you're bound in that sin.

291
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:43,120
 You know what, Jesus, He came to die because He knew that we would be tempted to give in

292
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,680
 to those things, to run back to those things.

293
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:54,560
 And the good news is that Jesus paid for your sin and my sin.

294
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:02,640
 JD quoted it earlier, but he said 2 Corinthians 5, 17, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ,

295
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,240
 he's a new creation.

296
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,760
 The old has passed away, and behold, the new has come."

297
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,280
 Maybe the whole point of this series that we're going to dive into tonight is that Jesus

298
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:24,200
 takes everything, He takes everything in your life and He begins to make it new.

299
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,560
 He doesn't take the bad that you are and make it good.

300
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,960
 He takes the dead person you were before Christ and He makes you alive.

301
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,160
 He makes you incredibly new.

302
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,400
 He gives you a new life and you don't have to wallow in the shame and the guilt anymore.

303
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,000
 Rest in peace to the old you, my bro, my daughter.

304
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,640
 Girl, you don't have to live chained and in bondage.

305
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,360
 Some of you tonight, you don't want to share that thing.

306
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,880
 You know that thing.

307
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,240
 It's keeping you in chains.

308
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,000
 It's keeping you in bondage.

309
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,160
 But you need to share it tonight because Romans 8, 1 says, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ,

310
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,640
 he doesn't have to experience condemnation.

311
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:27,200
 There is therefore now no condemnation for those that are in Christ Jesus."

312
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,880
 He makes you new.

313
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,420
 And so some of you, man, you need to die.

314
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:43,000
 Some of us, like I did my third year in college in that apartment, I had a funeral and that

315
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,400
 funeral was mine.

316
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,760
 Like I had never really surrendered my life to Christ.

317
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,680
 Like intellectually, I was what I call an intellectual believer for 21, 22 years of

318
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,100
 my life.

319
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,400
 But I kept doing the same things over and over, expecting a different result.

320
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,880
 See, you want to know if you really believe?

321
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,720
 Watch how you live your life.

322
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,040
 Men and women always say what they think, but they do what they believe.

323
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,760
 You want to watch what someone believes?

324
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,240
 Just watch how they behave.

325
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
 It's simple.

326
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,360
 Jesus begins to change you from the inside out when you say, "Hey, listen, I might have

327
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,720
 struggled with that, but listen, I want to fight against it.

328
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
 I don't want to make excuses.

329
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,600
 I don't want to keep running back to that thing."

330
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,640
 Some of you need to die to you.

331
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:44,440
 Some of you, you need to pick up the trophy and the resume that you're building and chasing

332
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:51,560
 that next promotion and it needs to go back into the casket tonight.

333
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,120
 You need to die to that.

334
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,720
 Not because it's necessarily bad in and of itself, like I said, but because it defines

335
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:06,060
 you and it's keeping you from being who you know God's called you to be.

336
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:12,140
 Or that hurt from previous relationships.

337
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:19,960
 Jesus has forgiven you and you don't need to carry the pain from those relationships

338
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
 anymore.

339
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
 You don't need to carry that hurt.

340
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:28,840
 You can forgive others because Christ has forgiven you.

341
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,200
 Or comparison, man.

342
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:36,220
 Anytime you are so fixated on other people and what they're doing, their work, it keeps

343
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,440
 you from doing your work.

344
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:45,360
 See, Jesus takes comparison and he makes it celebration because he's created you to be

345
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,400
 unique and to be you and there's no one else like you.

346
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,220
 He takes that comparison and he celebrates what he's called you to do and he celebrates

347
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,940
 what he's called others to do and you can be free from that.

348
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:07,560
 Because when you pursue him, he will begin to show you how you take your time, your talents

349
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:15,180
 and your treasures and you begin to leverage those for his glory and for his kingdom.

350
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:20,360
 There is no comparison when that's the case.

351
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,160
 So many of us, we spend so much time wishing we were like them when God's made you not

352
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,560
 to be like them.

353
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:34,760
 He will show you who you are called to be if you would just lay it down and pursue him.

354
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:42,440
 For some of us, man, tonight's the night.

355
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,480
 Twelve years of a porn addiction.

356
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,440
 The thing that you said you would never tell anybody that you're going to take to the grave.

357
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
 Tonight is the night.

358
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,440
 We got to lay it down.

359
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,160
 Like we're doing business tonight.

360
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:03,780
 We're putting the addictions in this room to rest because Christ has died for those

361
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:10,320
 and he not only died but he was raised to life and we serve a living God, not a dead

362
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,200
 God, who you can talk to, who you can have a relationship with.

363
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,240
 And the same spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead promises to live inside of you

364
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,240
 and me.

365
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:27,400
 And if it can raise a dead man from the ground, it can take care of your porn addiction or

366
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,640
 that abortion that you said you would never tell anyone about.

367
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
 Let me talk to you.

368
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,480
 You're loved.

369
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,840
 Jesus loves you in spite of all of that.

370
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:46,840
 Or that guy that took advantage of you or maybe you're the perpetrator, young man.

371
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,920
 God loves you.

372
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,200
 He wants to meet you in that pain.

373
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,240
 He wants to meet you in that sin.

374
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,520
 He wants to set you free tonight because he died the death that you and I were supposed

375
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,120
 to die.

376
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,520
 And he lived the life that you and I could never live.

377
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,040
 He got what we deserved and we get what he deserved.

378
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
 It's called the great exchange.

379
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:22,600
 It's the most incredible message out there and I can't stop telling people about it.

380
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,120
 So here's what we're going to do.

381
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,280
 We need to ask ourselves an honest question.

382
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,680
 What is that thing that we need to bury?

383
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:41,120
 What is that thing that we need to die to tonight once and for all?

384
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,060
 Do you believe that God can free you once you die to it?

385
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,880
 I believe he can.

386
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:56,240
 And there's a whole community, there's thousands of people here that I believe can be set free

387
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,320
 and that you can begin to walk with week in and week out every Tuesday night and you can

388
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,320
 get plugged in outside of this place and you can go all in and there's no more excuses.

389
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,800
 Tonight's the night.

390
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,520
 And so you're going to see, if you haven't already, maybe you already discovered it,

391
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,480
 but there's an index card and a sharpie marker underneath every chair.

392
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:26,560
 Why don't you grab that out for me?

393
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,360
 Pull that out.

394
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,600
 And this is what we're going to do.

395
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:40,000
 We're going to write that thing that is keeping you from going all in with Jesus.

396
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,760
 Some of you tonight, you just need to write your name.

397
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,440
 Like if this was me at 22, I'm writing Josiah Jones.

398
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,600
 That's the thing that I'm dying to and that's the funeral that I'm going to have tonight.

399
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,760
 And you need to surrender your life to Jesus.

400
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:06,720
 Others of you, you got to surrender performance, achievement, comparison, brokenness, like

401
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:14,360
 hurt, pain, and past relationships, addictions.

402
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:24,080
 And we're going to shut those sins once and for all.

403
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:33,600
 And so we have a team of leaders that are going to be in the balcony and on the edges

404
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,800
 of the rows, like at the end of the rows.

405
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,800
 If you're close to the stage, you can drop that card off on the stage.

406
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,400
 And so we're going to interact tonight with the message because I believe this is a powerful

407
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,320
 moment for you to draw a line in the sand, for you to nail a stake in the ground, and

408
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,600
 for you not to forget there's nothing special.

409
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,840
 There's nothing magical about this moment other than you just saying, "Hey, tonight's

410
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,200
 the night.

411
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,680
 I'm done.

412
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:07,540
 My sin is dead and gone because of what Christ has done."

413
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:14,640
 And I believe moments like this, you can look back on and God can give you the power and

414
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:22,720
 the strength in remembering what you did because it's a physical act.

415
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,480
 Like we're going to stand up and we're going to drop it off in a basket that leaders will

416
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,040
 have all throughout this auditorium.

417
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,280
 And like I said, if you're close to the stage, you can just drop it off on the stage.

418
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,520
 And some of you in the balcony, you just need to come all the way down here to the stage

419
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,920
 because you just need to sit in this moment as long as you can.

420
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,880
 If that's you, don't be ashamed.

421
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
 We're not going to belabor it.

422
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,880
 We're not going to drag this on, but we're going to give you an opportunity tonight to

423
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,280
 bear your sin.

424
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:58,160
 Father God, would you move in a mighty way as we continue to worship you in song?

425
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:09,920
 And God, would you allow men and women all across this auditorium to just die?

426
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,760
 Paul says in Galatians 2.20 that I've been crucified with Christ and it's no longer I

427
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,840
 who live, but it's Christ who lives in me.

428
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,560
 And the life that I now live, I live by faith in the Son of Man who loved me and gave himself

429
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,400
 for me.

430
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:30,080
 So God, would we crucify our life and the things that are hindering us from knowing

431
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,140
 you more and making you known?

432
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,140
 We love you.

433
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,080
 We worship you now.

434
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,800
 In Jesus' name.
