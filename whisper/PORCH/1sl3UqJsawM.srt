1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:14,440
 - All right, what's up guys?

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,360
 Welcome friends in the room,

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,080
 friends in Fort Worth and El Paso and Houston

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,440
 and Tulsa and Ohio and Iowa and Florida

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,720
 and wherever else you are joining us

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,720
 and especially welcome fellow Dallasites,

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,200
 home of the Mavs.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,640
 And not our strongest start so far,

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,120
 but hey, we're continuing this series, Vice and Virtue.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,960
 I'm gonna start with a story

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,320
 that'll give us some traction.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,800
 When I moved to Dallas from the University of Texas A&M,

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,240
 I-- (audience cheering)

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,040
 Man, it gets me every time.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,040
 Didn't see that coming, love it.

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,800
 I moved into a back house for a little bit

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,080
 and then eventually moved into,

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,760
 a friend of mine had a house in Lakewood,

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,360
 which is an area in Dallas,

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,320
 and me and another guy moved in with him

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,880
 and it was like, it just felt like adulting

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,000
 for the first time in a while.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,720
 We weren't in an apartment or a dorm

25
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,760
 or like a back house or a garage apartment.

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,320
 We were in kind of like your own home

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,560
 with a yard you gotta mow and just responsibilities.

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,760
 And one of the things inside of the house

29
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,320
 was it had a fireplace.

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,000
 It wasn't a wood fireplace,

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,280
 it was a gas fire or gas log fireplace.

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,560
 And I, well, you'll know why I say that in a second.

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,840
 And so I moved into the house,

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,880
 it was kind of wintertime

35
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,520
 and I was in grad school at the time.

36
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,640
 So on one of the earlier nights that I was there,

37
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,040
 I decided, well, everyone else had plans that evening

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,560
 and I had to study for an exam that was kind of,

39
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,640
 so I stood home, was reading and decided,

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,680
 I'm gonna light a fire.

41
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,520
 It's cold outside, light this gas log fireplace.

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,420
 So gas logs don't produce smoke

43
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,040
 like a wood fire would do.

44
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,440
 So you just turn it on, it's pretty awesome,

45
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,040
 turn it on, light it and welcome to 2018.

46
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,000
 So I light the fire, I'm reading a book,

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,480
 I end up falling asleep on the couch.

48
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,280
 My roommate comes home and he's the guy who owns a home.

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
 He says, oh man, hey, great call.

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,320
 Kind of wakes me up, great call

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,720
 in lighting the fireplace, it's freezing outside.

52
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,460
 Hey, you made sure to open the flu, right?

53
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,040
 And I said, what are you talking about?

54
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,800
 Open the flu, yeah, you open the flu.

55
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,080
 What are you, pause, let me hit pause on the story

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,920
 because if you don't know what the flu is,

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,000
 like me, circa eight years ago,

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,680
 you're going, what, open the flu?

59
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,520
 What are you talking about?

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,880
 Like the thing that is infecting half of America right now?

61
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,320
 Is that what you mean by flu?

62
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,520
 The flu, the chimney flu,

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,440
 is altogether different than this virus.

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,560
 The chimney flu is the thing inside of the chimney

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,000
 that you open up or has to be opened up

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 and it allows, if it's a wood fire,

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,520
 the smoke to go up the chimney

68
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,720
 and if it is a gas log burning fire,

69
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,820
 the carbon monoxide that will kill you

70
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,840
 to go out the chimney.

71
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,320
 And so I'm going, what are you talking about?

72
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,440
 You didn't open up the flu?

73
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,320
 He turns off the fire, he goes, opens up the flu,

74
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,400
 starts opening doors, he's like,

75
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,380
 how long has the fire been burning?

76
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,280
 And I'm like, several hours at this point.

77
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,600
 And he's like, you know, that will kill you.

78
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,400
 And I'm like, what are you talking about, it'll kill you?

79
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,480
 I would have realized or smelled it

80
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,760
 or sensed there's something wrong.

81
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,800
 No, carbon monoxide, you can't see it, you can't smell it,

82
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,760
 you can't sense that it's there.

83
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,680
 And yet, if you breathe it in, it will kill you.

84
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,000
 And it is the thing filling your lungs right now

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,840
 in this house.

86
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,820
 And so we're like now scrambling,

87
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,760
 trying to get the air out.

88
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,000
 And I'm going, oh my gosh, you go into like panic mode.

89
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,040
 Like, do I need to go to a doctor right now?

90
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,020
 I'm starting to feel funny.

91
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,840
 And so I did what any guy does,

92
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,680
 didn't go to the doctor.

93
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,920
 I just began looking up the worst possible case scenario

94
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,520
 on Wikipedia and finding out what would happen

95
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,180
 if you inhale large amounts of carbon monoxide.

96
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,360
 Thankfully, he came home and thankfully,

97
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,080
 everything ended up working out fine.

98
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,540
 But the reason I start there is because just like

99
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,680
 in that scenario, where there was something in the air

100
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,040
 that I was breathing that was killing me

101
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,360
 and would kill me from the inside out,

102
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,520
 we are talking tonight about a vice that is in the air

103
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,980
 that we breathe as Americans

104
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,560
 that is killing us from the inside out.

105
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,880
 And it is the vice of entitlement.

106
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,200
 Entitlement.

107
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,360
 Throughout this series, Vice and Virtue,

108
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,920
 we essentially go and we look at some of the biggest vices

109
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,640
 of our generation and really kind of inside of our culture

110
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,460
 and couple them with the virtue, the biblical virtue,

111
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,600
 that should replace them.

112
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,840
 Entitlement, what do I mean by it's in the air

113
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,680
 that we breathe?

114
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,500
 What does it mean to be entitled?

115
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,480
 Entitlement, what I mean by that is just this

116
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,920
 really pervasive attitude all across our country

117
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,680
 and just all of us that can be easily

118
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,620
 and endlessly almost focused on hey, what I deserve,

119
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,280
 what I'm owed, what I'm entitled to.

120
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,880
 And it is something that when I say it's in the air

121
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,040
 that we breathe, it truly is.

122
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,920
 I mean, just kind of as Americans, we're all about like,

123
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,480
 hey, you're owed this, you deserve this.

124
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,040
 We live in a culture that's on demand more than ever before

125
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,120
 that just constantly feeds it, where it's like,

126
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,740
 man, I can't have a pizza in five minutes.

127
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,700
 I can order some from Jeff Bezos in Amazon

128
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,240
 and it'll be here in two hours.

129
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,000
 We are fed kind of this like, hey, you earned it,

130
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,560
 you deserve it, and our expectations are higher than ever.

131
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,840
 And as we're gonna see tonight,

132
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,920
 our expectations are directly connected

133
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,160
 to this sense of entitlement.

134
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,060
 I mean, it's such a part of even just materialism.

135
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,020
 Marketers, if you studied marketing in college,

136
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,240
 you probably came across what marketing studies

137
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,000
 will show you is marketers will try to convince you

138
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,240
 you deserve something, you earned it, you work hard,

139
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,240
 you have earned this car, this vacation,

140
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,080
 this whatever it is.

141
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,600
 And so not only is it in the air that we're breathing,

142
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,400
 there's something just a part of our sin nature

143
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,440
 where it is like easy for me, with no effort,

144
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,640
 things in my life to quickly move to

145
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,880
 I feel entitled to them.

146
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,960
 Things that were like, oh, this is an amazing gift,

147
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,440
 one week, the next week becomes something

148
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,280
 I just feel entitled to.

149
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,400
 Example, last week at the porch, if you were here,

150
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,700
 it was like seven degrees outside, so we decided,

151
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,320
 hey, we're gonna go pick everyone up in golf carts

152
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,480
 so that if you're really far away,

153
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,080
 we'll go pick you up at the golf cart.

154
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,020
 So people, some of our volunteers are driving around

155
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,080
 picking up people at the five-story parking garage

156
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,180
 and like the joy on people's faces,

157
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,700
 you would have thought like we were handing out

158
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,440
 just suitcases of cash to people,

159
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,760
 like, oh my gosh, this is amazing, thank you so much.

160
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,880
 And they'd get inside of the golf cart,

161
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,960
 they'd ride through.

162
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,040
 You know what happens the next week

163
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,280
 when you had a golf cart show up

164
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,000
 and pick you up at the fifth-story parking garage?

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,720
 You're like, where's the stinking golf carts?

166
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,080
 You serious, huh?

167
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,720
 I'm having to walk a stinking mile to get to church,

168
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,680
 there's no golf carts here.

169
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,080
 What is wrong with this place?

170
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,920
 I'm going somewhere else.

171
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,380
 I mean, it just quickly, with no effort at all,

172
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,000
 we move in the direction of entitlement.

173
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,080
 It's in the air that we breathe,

174
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,440
 it's just kind of a part of our DNA,

175
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,400
 and it's very easy for us to get there,

176
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,840
 and yet it is without question,

177
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,100
 it is impacting our relationships in a toxic way.

178
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,840
 It is gonna rob, it does rob all of us of joy and gratitude.

179
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,480
 And I think most of us are unaware.

180
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,800
 Similar to carbon monoxide, we're like,

181
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,840
 I can't see it.

182
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,240
 It's like almost, here's what I thought

183
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,440
 when I was preparing this message this week.

184
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,680
 I was like, this might be the first time

185
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,400
 I've ever given a message where I'm like,

186
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,600
 I don't think this is a problem for me.

187
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,360
 I think I got entitlement down.

188
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,520
 Like, I don't think I'm that entitled to things.

189
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,040
 And literally, as I'm writing and working on it yesterday,

190
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,160
 JP and Garrett, who's in Fort Worth,

191
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,400
 and I will prepare messages together

192
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,480
 and we'll kind of like, you know,

193
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,360
 pick up the phone and work

194
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,720
 and just talk through different things.

195
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,200
 Neither of them, and so that was the plan.

196
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,720
 Hey, Friday or Monday afternoon,

197
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
 we'll connect and we'll have chances to do that.

198
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,320
 And for whatever reason, because of a fire thing

199
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,440
 in Fort Worth, a big fire that kind of broke out,

200
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,320
 Garrett had some lack of availability

201
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,080
 and JP had similar circumstances.

202
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,360
 And I'm sitting there going, what the heck, you guys?

203
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,000
 I thought we were gonna work on this thing together.

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,060
 And you want me to write this entitlement message

205
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,900
 all on my own?

206
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,960
 Are you serious?

207
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,200
 I'm entitled to have some people

208
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,720
 help me out here a little bit.

209
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,640
 And I'm like, oh my gosh, I thought I had this thing down.

210
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,760
 Turns out maybe I don't.

211
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,600
 And here's what I think.

212
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,920
 I think that's how all of us are.

213
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,520
 I don't think anyone in the room really,

214
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,000
 when we think entitled, we think of the kid who's like,

215
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,080
 dad, my Range Rover has 20 miles on it.

216
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,320
 Can we change it out, please?

217
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,600
 We don't think like, oh, maybe I'm entitled.

218
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,220
 Maybe there's parts of me that like have expectations

219
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,580
 or is more focused on what I deserve and what I'm owed

220
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,480
 and what God hasn't given me or what my boss should give me

221
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,360
 and how much I should make that there's a part of all of us

222
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,200
 that is entitled.

223
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,000
 Tonight, Jesus is gonna display through a parable

224
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,080
 in Matthew chapter 20.

225
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
 If you have a Bible, you can flip open to Matthew chapter 20

226
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,020
 he is going to show us some of the cause

227
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,980
 that stems or where our entitlement stems from,

228
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,740
 what it does to the relationships that we have

229
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,320
 and then the remedy that we're given

230
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,540
 to kill entitlement inside of our lives.

231
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,640
 So Matthew chapter 20, we're gonna start in really verse 30

232
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,080
 of chapter 19, right before it,

233
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,880
 Jesus would often tell a parable.

234
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,680
 A parable is kind of like a made up story

235
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,040
 and it is a made up story.

236
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,480
 It was a made up story that Jesus would tell

237
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,600
 in order to make a point or in order to teach something.

238
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,840
 And so on this one, he gives his disciples this parable

239
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,560
 and in so doing gives us a look

240
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,200
 into the problems of entitlement and the cure for it.

241
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,960
 So verse 30 of chapter 19, here's what it says.

242
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,320
 Jesus speaking, "But many who are first will be last

243
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,580
 "and many who are last will be first.

244
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,560
 "For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner

245
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,760
 "who went out early in the morning

246
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,020
 "to hire workers for his vineyard.

247
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,680
 "He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day

248
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,080
 "and he sent them into the vineyard."

249
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,360
 So Jesus starts saying, hey, let me tell you

250
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,240
 kind of what kingdom of heaven, how it works,

251
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,080
 what it's like.

252
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,880
 It's like a guy owns this plot of land,

253
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,720
 it's a vineyard, he's got grapes growing,

254
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,320
 he's gonna make some wine, decides,

255
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,080
 I need some people to work on this field.

256
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,520
 Goes over to Home Depot, whatever they had at the time,

257
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,200
 says, hey guys, do you wanna work for the day?

258
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,320
 I'll pay you a denarius.

259
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,720
 Here's what you need to know about a denarius.

260
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,780
 Essentially, denarius is like above minimum wage.

261
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,260
 It would be like 15 to $20 an hour times eight hours.

262
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,220
 So for the day's wage, I'm gonna pay you really well.

263
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,060
 Will you come work?

264
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,300
 They agree to work.

265
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,380
 The man sends them into the field.

266
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,620
 It's early in the morning, maybe six or 7 a.m.

267
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,040
 Story continues.

268
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,280
 "About nine in the morning, the landowner went out

269
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,940
 "and he saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.

270
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,180
 "He told them, you also go and work in my vineyard

271
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,820
 "and I will pay you whatever is right.

272
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,220
 "So they went.

273
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,340
 "And he went out again at about noon

274
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,560
 "and about three in the afternoon

275
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,520
 "and he did the same thing."

276
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,140
 So the guy goes out at nine, says,

277
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,000
 hey, do you wanna work today?

278
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,520
 Go out in the field, I'll pay you whatever's right.

279
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,240
 Goes out at noon, hey, do you wanna work today?

280
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,520
 Finds more people, go out,

281
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,960
 and apparently it's a big vineyard.

282
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,440
 And he finds people again at three o'clock.

283
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,120
 Hey, whatever's right, I'll pay you, go out there.

284
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,600
 Then finally, at about five in the afternoon,

285
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,120
 now there's only one hour left in the workday.

286
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,480
 The workday ended at six o'clock.

287
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,120
 So at five in the afternoon, he goes out again

288
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,880
 and he's like, hey, do you wanna work today?

289
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,080
 Sends them out with one hour left in the day,

290
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,000
 in the workday.

291
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,520
 You may have the 11th hour in your text.

292
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,660
 "He went out and he found others still standing around

293
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,880
 "and he asked them, why have you been standing here all day

294
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,720
 "doing nothing?

295
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,300
 "Because no one has hired us, verse seven they answered.

296
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,680
 "He said to them, you also go and work in my vineyard.

297
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,700
 "When evening came, the owner of the vineyard

298
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,380
 "said to his foreman,

299
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,600
 "call the workers together and pay them

300
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,540
 "and pay them their wages beginning with the last ones

301
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,880
 "that were hired and going on to the first."

302
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,680
 Which is unusual in this time.

303
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,560
 Just like many times today,

304
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,440
 you would pay the people who've been here the longest,

305
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,400
 they're gonna get paid first.

306
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
 Those guys who just showed up, you'll get paid last.

307
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,560
 But he says, we're gonna flip it.

308
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,000
 And here's what happens.

309
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,520
 "The workers who were hired at about five in the afternoon,

310
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,360
 "the people who only worked one hour,

311
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,240
 "they came and they each received a denarius.

312
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,200
 "Each received 150 bucks.

313
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,860
 "So when those who came who were hired first,

314
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,340
 "they expected to receive more."

315
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,460
 So they're sitting in line going,

316
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,120
 he just paid the one hour guys 150 bucks.

317
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,540
 We've been here for 12, oh my gosh,

318
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,280
 we're gonna get like, you know, 100,000s of dollars.

319
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,860
 They're already going through what they're gonna buy

320
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,860
 with their money, maybe a new camel,

321
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,060
 whatever you bought in that day for $1,200.

322
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,540
 And they're beginning to think through it,

323
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,700
 expecting that because we've been here 12 times as long,

324
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,580
 we're gonna get 12 times as much.

325
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,200
 "Having an attitude of what they thought they deserved."

326
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,400
 But here's what happens.

327
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:13,240
 "But each one of them also received a denarius.

328
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,800
 "And when they received it, they began to grumble."

329
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,640
 I'm gonna pause there.

330
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,120
 The word grumble just means they became indignant.

331
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,160
 So they're sitting in line

332
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,840
 and they're indignant at the landowner.

333
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,900
 They're indignant in general because they felt entitled.

334
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,160
 Not that they had been done wrong

335
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,280
 or not that, you know, the guy lied to them

336
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,120
 or kind of cheated on them.

337
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,220
 He said, "I'll pay you a denarius."

338
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,140
 And they're sitting there going,

339
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,020
 "Hey, I feel like I deserve more."

340
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,460
 Our first idea from this text is that entitlement

341
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,900
 stems from what we think we deserve.

342
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,500
 I know that sounds pretty straightforward,

343
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,980
 but it's a key in understanding how we can experience

344
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,820
 a cure for the entitlement that we experience.

345
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,580
 That entitlement is just where you put the expectation,

346
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,580
 you begin to have the expectation

347
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,100
 of what you think you're owed

348
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,940
 or what you think that you deserved.

349
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,380
 And anytime that those expectations are not met,

350
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,220
 "Hey, I expected to be paid more,"

351
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,960
 it exposes the entitlement inside of our hearts.

352
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
 It exposes the entitlement.

353
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,120
 Like maybe you've experienced this at work

354
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,720
 where your job came up and it's the, you know,

355
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
 about to transition to a new fiscal year

356
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,540
 and you're expecting, "I'm gonna get a promotion,

357
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,440
 "maybe some sort of raise," and it doesn't happen.

358
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,080
 Worse yet, somebody else gets a promotion,

359
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,420
 like, "Really, you gave Bob a promotion?

360
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,640
 "I didn't get a promotion," and it exposes entitlement.

361
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,920
 This happens all the time where, you know,

362
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,440
 someone will start really running hard after Christ

363
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,080
 and they're diving in the community group

364
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,140
 and they are getting plugged in

365
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,480
 and they're serving and all of that.

366
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,980
 And some point, they hit this wall

367
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,520
 where they begin to become bitter towards God

368
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,580
 that they're not where they want to be

369
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,640
 in their relationship status.

370
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,260
 They're like, "Man, I thought if I got everything

371
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,000
 "kind of right and I really started following hard

372
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,740
 "after Christ that, you know, Mr. Right or Mrs. Right

373
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,300
 "would come along and God, you would, you know,

374
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,020
 "I thought I would be married by now

375
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,420
 "and have at least one on the way,"

376
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,840
 or if you're a guy, someone with one on the way,

377
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,740
 and it's not the case at all.

378
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,200
 And it exposes the entitlement that's inside of their heart.

379
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,560
 I mean, when tragically, honestly,

380
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,260
 when things inside of our life

381
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,500
 just kind of begin to fall apart,

382
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,600
 maybe a parent gets sick,

383
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,980
 maybe something really tragic happens,

384
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,180
 people will get bitter at God.

385
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,860
 And it reflects the fact that there was an entitlement

386
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,820
 inside of their heart that I felt entitled

387
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,780
 to have parents that lived.

388
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,380
 I felt entitled to have good health.

389
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,100
 I felt entitled to not lose my job.

390
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,860
 And I'm angry at you for it, God.

391
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,820
 Entitlement stems from us not getting

392
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,360
 what we think that we deserve.

393
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,860
 And what the Bible tells us is that you and I are to not,

394
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,540
 the goal is to not, hey, so you need to make sure

395
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,140
 that you just lower your expectations

396
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,100
 of whatever you deserve.

397
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,140
 The goal's not to lower them, the goal's not to raise them,

398
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,100
 it is to base them on what the Bible says you deserve.

399
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,840
 It is to live a life that stems from,

400
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,100
 I am gonna base my expectations

401
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,260
 on what the Bible tells me I deserve.

402
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,740
 I'm not gonna set my expectations

403
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,680
 on what I'm entitled to based on socially or culturally

404
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,600
 kind of what others have and what I don't.

405
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,220
 I'm gonna set them biblically.

406
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,100
 What do I mean by that?

407
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,240
 The Bible says if you're a Christian,

408
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,660
 we should be the least entitled people in the world.

409
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,220
 Because the Bible teaches that, hey, what is it,

410
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,780
 at the end of the day, what do I deserve?

411
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,100
 Hell, that's what I deserve.

412
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,960
 That's what my sin deserves, that's what my life deserves.

413
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,980
 Like, what does God owe me, or what am I owed?

414
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,820
 Hell.

415
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,300
 And yet at the same time,

416
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,380
 it also tells us the incredible truth

417
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,700
 that the God who's there provided a way,

418
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,640
 dying in our place, so that we could have eternal life.

419
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,780
 That I was owed, I deserve hell,

420
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,660
 that's where I should align my expectations,

421
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,660
 and yet God, in his incredible love for me,

422
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,740
 despite the fact that I don't deserve it,

423
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,860
 died in my place, has promised me

424
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,180
 eternity with him in paradise forever.

425
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,240
 In other words, not just, hey, you don't have to go to hell,

426
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,460
 you get to spend eternity in paradise.

427
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,860
 It's be comparable to, hey, I'm not just gonna pay off

428
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,900
 your student loans, I'm gonna give you $10 billion.

429
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,780
 That's what we have been given inside of Christ.

430
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,460
 That it's not just that, hey, we weren't given,

431
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,940
 or what we deserve is hell,

432
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,100
 and God has now promised us something,

433
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,740
 which is eternal life with him forever.

434
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,340
 And the Bible presents this idea, it's pretty crazy,

435
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,340
 that that should be enough.

436
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,340
 I mean, isn't that like, it almost just,

437
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,820
 'cause we're Americans, we're like, man,

438
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,400
 what an American dream, that it's insane

439
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,500
 that at some point in time, that stopped being enough.

440
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,460
 That, hey, you don't have to go spend eternity

441
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,020
 away from God forever in hell, eternally separated from him,

442
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,020
 you get to spend eternity with him forever.

443
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,000
 And even inside of this room, it's like, oh my gosh,

444
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,700
 well, that is not coming for a while, I hope.

445
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,540
 So is there something else that you can give me?

446
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,500
 So here, what now should we expect?

447
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,060
 That's what we deserved, we weren't given that,

448
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,620
 we were promised by God eternal life forever and ever.

449
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,260
 So what should we expect from God now in this life?

450
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,700
 Nothing.

451
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,780
 Or at least nothing that doesn't come directly

452
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,140
 from God's word.

453
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,540
 Like, you and I are to set our expectations biblically,

454
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,100
 and I mean that with all my heart,

455
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,740
 that you and I, truly, if you base your expectations on,

456
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,500
 hey, God's gonna give me a long life,

457
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,860
 God's gonna give me kids that know him, or kids at all,

458
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,100
 or a husband, or a wife, or any of that stuff,

459
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,060
 you are setting yourself up for frustration,

460
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,180
 for disappointment.

461
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:20,380
 And you are entitled, and reflecting that entitlement.

462
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,260
 The God who's there says, man, inside of this life,

463
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,220
 here's what you can expect.

464
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,100
 You wanna expect him, or align your expectations biblically?

465
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,500
 You can expect you're gonna have trouble

466
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,520
 inside of this world.

467
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,380
 That's what Jesus promises.

468
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,460
 John chapter 16, looks into his disciples,

469
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,280
 says, hey, I'm gonna go, prepare a place,

470
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,260
 we're gonna be forever together in eternity,

471
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,260
 it's gonna be amazing, but in this world,

472
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,940
 you're going to have trouble.

473
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,220
 Things are gonna be, it's Jesus' words,

474
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,700
 like, guys, I'm gonna shoot you straight.

475
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,420
 It's gonna be rough, okay?

476
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,860
 But I've overcome the world, that's what he says.

477
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,540
 So the expectations that you and I are to have,

478
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:56,200
 as crazy as that sounds, is that God doesn't owe me anything.

479
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,180
 And when I become more aware of that,

480
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,660
 it begins to allow me to be more grateful.

481
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,400
 Everything else is just icing on top.

482
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,940
 Another day that I lived, another opportunity

483
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,380
 where God provided another meal, another opportunity,

484
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,980
 everything else becomes like, man,

485
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,380
 none of this was promised.

486
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,240
 God, you're so good, thank you.

487
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,060
 Help me to not fall in love with the gifts

488
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,980
 that you've given, but in love with you more,

489
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,300
 the giver of those gifts, that we set our expectations

490
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,240
 of what we deserve, biblically, not socially.

491
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,420
 Socially is what happened in the parable,

492
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,940
 where they kinda essentially looked around

493
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,100
 and they're like, look, all my friends

494
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,340
 or all the other people got this,

495
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,720
 so I think this would be fair,

496
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,540
 and God, if you don't give it to me, I'm angry at you.

497
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,580
 That's what they did to the landowner, who is God,

498
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,980
 essentially, who represents God inside of the story.

499
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,780
 Tragically, it's just all too common,

500
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,340
 part of the human experience, where often,

501
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,180
 the way we determine what we deserve or what is fair

502
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,780
 is based on what others have, a comparison.

503
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,860
 Even, this happened, even, there's a story in the Bible

504
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,260
 where the disciples, this happened with Peter and John.

505
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,900
 Peter and John were two of the disciples,

506
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,460
 and Jesus, in John chapter 21, you can read it later,

507
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,660
 has this conversation with Peter,

508
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,300
 where he essentially says, Peter,

509
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,860
 he begins to tell Peter how he's gonna die,

510
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,580
 and Peter would be crucified upside down,

511
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,900
 and Jesus kinda tells a, man, here's what's gonna happen,

512
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,380
 and Peter's gonna willingly die for his faith,

513
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,140
 and Jesus says, this is what the future holds for you,

514
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,160
 but don't lose heart and remain faithful,

515
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,900
 and Peter soaks it all in, and then it says

516
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,860
 he does what is so easy for any of us to do.

517
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,580
 He's like, it says, literally, the text says,

518
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,220
 and then he looked over and he saw John,

519
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,820
 and he's like, great, okay, I'm gonna die,

520
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,920
 crucified upside down.

521
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,740
 What's gonna happen to John?

522
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,660
 Like, what's the faith that he's gonna have?

523
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,300
 Are we sure we're handing these out equally?

524
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,700
 And Jesus looks at him and he says,

525
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,380
 that's not between you and John, or me and you,

526
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,300
 that's between me and John.

527
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,700
 Like, if I, and it says, if I want John to live forever,

528
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,140
 that's for me, between me and John,

529
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,340
 and the text is so funny 'cause it literally says,

530
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,940
 and from that day forward, a rumor went around

531
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,580
 with people saying that John would live forever,

532
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,220
 but it didn't say that John would live forever,

533
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,540
 is what it says there.

534
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,740
 If you knew your Bible, that would be funny, okay?

535
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,860
 (congregation laughing)

536
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,660
 But Jesus says to Peter what I think he would say

537
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,820
 to all of us, hey, your faith is between me and you.

538
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,180
 The hand that I deal to someone else

539
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,180
 is not between you and me and them,

540
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,420
 it's between me and them.

541
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,120
 This is between me and you, Peter.

542
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,820
 Don't base your expectations on what life has for you

543
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,500
 based on what others have, but based on what the Bible says.

544
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,540
 And to this landowner, he says, man, you're grumbling,

545
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,620
 you're angry at me, all based on your expectations

546
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,300
 of what you deserve, entitlement.

547
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,340
 And then he goes on to how entitlement really costs us,

548
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,560
 and here's what happens next inside of the story.

549
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,820
 Verse 11, when they received it, that's the denarius,

550
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,420
 they began to grumble or be indignant against the landowner.

551
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,100
 And they said, these who were hired last

552
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,820
 worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us

553
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,560
 who've borne the burden of work.

554
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,060
 We work 12, and we were in the heat of the day.

555
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,700
 The word there is like super hyperbolic language,

556
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,260
 or hyperbole, the heat of the day

557
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,140
 is essentially other translations

558
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,520
 or other places it's used is like set on fire.

559
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,460
 They're essentially like, look,

560
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,320
 we've been out here for 12 hours,

561
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,820
 it's like Houston in the summertime out here,

562
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,100
 we're burning up, I got sunburn all over me,

563
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,940
 you know how hot it is in the middle of the desert,

564
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,700
 and you made them equal to us?

565
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,940
 And they're angry at the landowner.

566
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,100
 They do what entitlement does to any of our hearts,

567
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,500
 it begins to move us in the direction

568
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,700
 of being angry or bitter towards other people

569
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,300
 because entitlement, our second point,

570
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,740
 entitlement poisons relationships.

571
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,540
 It always poisons relationships.

572
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,580
 It poisoned their relationship with the landowner,

573
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,540
 likely their relationship with the other five o'clock people

574
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,620
 who they weren't happy for, they were like,

575
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,040
 oh man, I can't believe this person,

576
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,900
 how do you think that walk home win?

577
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,340
 I mean, imagine had no entitlement

578
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,420
 been a part of this conversation,

579
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,260
 or no entitlement been in the hearts

580
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,460
 of the people who worked all day long.

581
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,940
 Imagine that they had just sat there,

582
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,660
 they received their wage, and they were like,

583
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,780
 oh my God, you just paid us the same

584
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,980
 as you paid that one hour?

585
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,780
 This landowner is incredible, look how generous this guy is.

586
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,700
 He paid us 150 bucks, we were here all day,

587
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,980
 I didn't have a job before this,

588
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,980
 he came along, he hired me, then he paid these guys,

589
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,300
 this is the most generous guy ever,

590
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,660
 I'm gonna work for you for the rest of my life,

591
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,540
 can I work for you tomorrow?

592
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,940
 Can't be here till five o'clock,

593
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,220
 but I'd love to work for you tomorrow.

594
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,500
 I mean, think about how different that would have been.

595
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,820
 And instead, they're like, man, I'm angry at this person

596
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,700
 because he didn't give me what I think that I deserve

597
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,620
 because I'm not getting what I think that I deserve

598
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,420
 because anytime there's entitlement,

599
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,500
 it poisons relationships, and it is poisoning

600
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,820
 the relationships in your life

601
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,100
 and the relationships in my life

602
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,900
 anytime that it intersects with them.

603
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,500
 Because entitlement, it just ruins

604
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,340
 or affects everything that it touches.

605
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,780
 It's like this, last week I was doing laundry

606
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,740
 in my house for, I have a wife and a two-year-old,

607
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,940
 and so doing laundry, just being dad of the year,

608
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,820
 husband of the year, I think I'm nominated

609
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,260
 for both right now, and, (audience laughing)

610
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,140
 self-nominated, self-nominated.

611
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,460
 But I'm going through, I'm doing laundry, this is great,

612
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,220
 and cleaning up the house, spring cleaning,

613
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,780
 getting all the Christmas stuff cleaned up,

614
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,820
 and I noticed that there's, around our Christmas tree

615
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,980
 that we had taken out, there was this thing

616
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,020
 called a tree skirt.

617
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,540
 What's a tree skirt?

618
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,020
 It's something, it's like a hat towel or a blanket

619
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,620
 you put at the bottom of a tree.

620
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,140
 I don't know, it's, keep moving.

621
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,380
 Anyways, it's this big red tree skirt,

622
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,660
 and so I was like, I'm gonna take that,

623
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,340
 wash that too, throw all the laundry together,

624
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,280
 and so I throw that in with the rest of the laundry.

625
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:42,740
 And, (laughing) man, everyone saw where this was going

626
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,140
 but me. (audience laughing)

627
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,740
 And so I'm doing the laundry, this is great,

628
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,800
 and my wife, I had to go off, I don't even know where.

629
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,660
 At some point, I left, and she fielded the laundry

630
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,940
 out of the washer, and she says,

631
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,340
 "Hey, did you put the tree skirt in

632
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,820
 "with the rest of the clothes?"

633
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,400
 Yeah, husband of the year, that's what I do.

634
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,520
 Because all of our clothes are now pink.

635
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,440
 My favorite shirt I got at Christmas is pink.

636
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,300
 Our towels are all pink.

637
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,420
 Everything that it touched was this lovely shade of pink.

638
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,020
 This shirt was bright white last week, now it's pink.

639
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,300
 That's not true.

640
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,860
 But everything that it touched was this shade of pink

641
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,860
 because it bled onto everything that it was around,

642
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,940
 entitlement, anything that it touches, it ruins,

643
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,480
 it affects, it poisons, and particularly

644
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,860
 as it relates to relationships.

645
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,680
 What do I mean by how can it poison relationships?

646
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,980
 Think about how entitlement has impacted

647
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,020
 and is impacting your friendships.

648
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,980
 And you can see this easier on the other side,

649
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,740
 like when you're friends with someone who's entitled

650
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,660
 who gets really angry that you didn't text them back

651
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,660
 because after only 30 minutes, they're like,

652
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,140
 really, 30 minutes later, are you kidding me?

653
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,100
 Life has moved on, I'm done with that.

654
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,260
 I mean, think about it.

655
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,460
 You can see how it impacts, like,

656
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,060
 you didn't come to my birthday party.

657
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,640
 You showed up late or you came for the very end.

658
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,540
 You missed that dinner that I had with all those people.

659
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,380
 You can see how it impacts and it erodes

660
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,980
 relationships and friendships at work.

661
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,500
 Entitlement, I mean, it'll mess your ability

662
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,780
 to work as a follower of Jesus, which is like,

663
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,580
 hey, I'm gonna faithfully serve, not my boss,

664
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,260
 but I'm gonna work as though I'm working for God,

665
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,180
 not for man.

666
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,700
 If you feel like your boss is not treating,

667
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,540
 if you feel entitled to be treated differently

668
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,100
 than your boss is treating you,

669
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,820
 I mean, it'll impact your dating relationships.

670
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,660
 Golly, please, listen up.

671
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,420
 If you're dating or if you ever want to date someday,

672
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,920
 if you date, so you do not wanna marry someone

673
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,920
 who's entitled, I mean, it is a horrible thing

674
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,340
 to step into a covenant with a person

675
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,260
 who has a certain expectation on where you're gonna live,

676
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,660
 what car she's gonna drive or he's gonna drive,

677
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,460
 what type of vacation they're gonna go on,

678
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,600
 just all the different ways that they expect to be treated

679
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,260
 and it is a very different thing to step into

680
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,300
 a relationship with someone who has no sense of entitlement.

681
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,360
 They're just grateful that you're there.

682
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,620
 They're grateful to be in this with you.

683
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,900
 They're not like, oh man, I can't believe

684
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,780
 that we're going back to Mexico.

685
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,660
 I always wanna go on vacation to Hawaii.

686
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,620
 We always end up in Mexico.

687
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,700
 They're just like, I can't believe we're going to Mexico.

688
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,780
 This is unbelievable.

689
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,740
 That's a very different reality

690
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,900
 and that's a reality you want, I promise.

691
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,640
 And it's not a reality that a lot of people have.

692
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,800
 If you pick up on entitlement, you need to jump ship now

693
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,140
 and I mean that sincerely and you should do it

694
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,600
 with a kind heart and sit them down and talk through

695
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,340
 why you don't see the relationship moving forward

696
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,380
 but it is deadly and if you begin to pick up on entitlement,

697
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,220
 it will make a miserable marriage.

698
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,400
 Entitlement will also impact your,

699
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,980
 and this is really common with young adults,

700
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,720
 their relationship to the church.

701
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,740
 I mean because they think entitlement is often

702
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,940
 at the foundation of how we decide on what church

703
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,020
 we're gonna be a part of and where we're gonna go.

704
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,220
 I mean think about the ways that you hear people

705
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,820
 talk about church and this is for people

706
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,020
 who maybe have been in church for a while.

707
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,060
 If you've been running with us for a while,

708
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,920
 you grew up in church, you'll hear people say things like,

709
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,460
 look, I'm just looking for the place where I get fed.

710
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,780
 Like in other words, I'm looking for a place

711
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,340
 where I'm entitled to that and then we'll say things like,

712
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,580
 I just feel like I'm gonna go here for a while

713
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,120
 because I wanna do a deep dive on the Old Testament.

714
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,260
 I don't feel like we're doing enough of that

715
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,580
 or Leviticus or Revelation.

716
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,300
 Will somebody tell me what's going on in Revelation?

717
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,500
 And we'll talk through, like hey, I'm entitled

718
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,040
 to go into a place where I feel fed

719
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,580
 and if you're not feeding me, then I'm outta here.

720
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,980
 I mean we had a guy come and visit our staff

721
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,000
 a couple weeks ago who joined us for what we call

722
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,740
 staff prayer but he was another pastor

723
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,460
 and he said, you know what's going on right now

724
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,740
 inside of our country?

725
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,500
 There's this epidemic of spiritual narcissism

726
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,620
 and I heard that and I was like, ah,

727
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,780
 I bet I know what he means, like just selfishness.

728
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,820
 And he said, here's what it looks like.

729
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,740
 People have the expectation,

730
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,940
 they put an expectation on their pastor,

731
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,940
 on their church that was never meant

732
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,360
 to be put on their pastor.

733
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,640
 It is not the job of a pastor to feed his flock.

734
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,880
 It is the job of a sheep to feed themselves.

735
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,860
 In other words, at the beginning that's fine

736
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,000
 and if someone grows but the point of Christianity

737
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,880
 is that you and I and every person who's a believer

738
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,980
 would get to the place where they can feed themselves.

739
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,340
 As silly as it would be for me to show up at your house

740
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,420
 because I'm like, look, I'm not sure you can eat on your own

741
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,820
 let's get some applesauce here.

742
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,260
 That's as silly as it is for people to show up

743
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,620
 years and years and years, sometimes decades

744
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,420
 and expect that man, if I'm ever gonna get fed,

745
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,620
 it's your job, your job is to learn how to feed yourself.

746
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,620
 And the pastor hopefully is an encouraging part of that

747
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,280
 but that's where God wants to lead you to.

748
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,780
 And if you find yourself in a place where hey,

749
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,700
 I'm entitled to be fed when I want, what I want

750
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:50,220
 and from who I want, you are a spiritual narcissist

751
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,820
 and you're not gonna grow in your faith

752
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,100
 or your faith is gonna be stunted.

753
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,980
 Honestly, we see this a lot of times at the porch

754
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,380
 where just, this is a plug for one of the girls who runs,

755
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,740
 who administratively helps us, where people will call in

756
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,220
 and they feel like entitled to know

757
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,260
 what the message is about.

758
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,740
 It's insane how like entitled, they're like,

759
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,120
 yeah, what's the message on tonight?

760
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,540
 Just wanna know, hey, and we won't tell you, heads up,

761
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,540
 so you're not ever gonna know.

762
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,420
 If you call in, just save it.

763
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,380
 And they're like, yeah, hey, yeah, I know you won't tell,

764
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,260
 but come on, just tell me what the message is about

765
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,620
 and I won't tell anybody.

766
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,180
 And we're like, no, we're not actually gonna tell.

767
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,940
 Do you guys even love God over there?

768
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,540
 Look, I'm just trying to know because I have a friend

769
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,860
 that I wanna invite to church.

770
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,020
 I'm not sure they're gonna wanna come

771
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,980
 if we're just talking about anything.

772
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,220
 Hey, I think they're gonna be encouraged.

773
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,260
 Okay, yeah, I'm going somewhere else.

774
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,900
 And it's like, oh my, entitlement.

775
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:42,380
 And it is deadly and it is poisoning

776
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,660
 and does poison relationships,

777
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,620
 poisons minds and it poisons yours.

778
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,900
 The opposite is true though for those who are not entitled.

779
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,220
 I mean, their relationships, it's just amazing

780
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,660
 how different it is when you interact with them.

781
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,620
 We've all interacted with people

782
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,260
 who really don't have a sense of entitlement.

783
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,820
 I mean, they're like, dude, you missed my birthday?

784
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,640
 Are you kidding me?

785
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,900
 You're so busy, don't worry.

786
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,260
 I got birthdays every year, man, literally, they come.

787
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,540
 They'll be another one, it'll be great.

788
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,900
 You missed the next five, who cares?

789
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,020
 Hopefully I'm around, if not,

790
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,260
 we'll be together for billions of years.

791
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,400
 And that's amazing.

792
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,300
 And they're just quick to forgive, they're quick to,

793
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,020
 that's the type of people you wanna be around.

794
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,060
 I mean, how much more attractive even is that

795
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,940
 in a friendship or a dating relationship?

796
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,820
 We've said it before, guys,

797
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,780
 if you wanna be more attractive tomorrow when you wake up,

798
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,820
 maybe you got hit by the ugly stick on the way out.

799
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,100
 You do not have to be worried.

800
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,540
 You could be more attractive in just a minute.

801
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,140
 I'm gonna give it to you right now.

802
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,300
 (laughing)

803
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,060
 There's no ugly stick, I apologize.

804
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,220
 (laughing)

805
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:48,020
 If you are someone who's grateful, you're not entitled,

806
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,340
 you're quick to forgive, you will be all of a sudden

807
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,140
 like more magnetic.

808
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,540
 People will wanna be around you,

809
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,940
 you'll be more attractive to the world around us,

810
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,180
 and God wants you to experience that.

811
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,540
 It's a better way to live.

812
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,980
 Free from the poison that entitlement brings

813
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,180
 to relationships, and finally,

814
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,660
 we're giving kind of the clearest indicator of the cure,

815
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,340
 the ongoing cure that we've talked a little bit about

816
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,660
 already for entitlement, but here's what Jesus says

817
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,580
 in verse 13.

818
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:21,100
 But he answered them, so they land on a response.

819
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,900
 I am not being unfair to you, friend.

820
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,180
 Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?

821
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,380
 Take your pay and go.

822
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,820
 I wanna give the one who was hired last

823
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,300
 the same as I gave you.

824
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:38,220
 Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money,

825
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,340
 or are you envious because I am generous?

826
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,380
 So the last will be first, and the first will be last.

827
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,060
 Excuse me.

828
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,860
 I wanna reread the line, are you envious

829
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,460
 because I'm generous, because inside of it

830
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,460
 there's something really significant taking place.

831
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,440
 Your translation may have, or is your eye evil?

832
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,980
 Neither of which is great.

833
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,140
 Essentially what the original language says

834
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,140
 is is your eye bad because I'm so good?

835
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,080
 In other words, are you gonna allow the goodness

836
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,620
 of the landowner to lead you to be angry at the landowner,

837
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,100
 to lead you to be angry at other people,

838
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,580
 and angry at the world around you?

839
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,760
 Or are you gonna be grateful to just the goodness

840
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,500
 of the landowner and the gifts that he's given to you,

841
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,180
 or to the payment, to what he's given to you?

842
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,780
 The third idea from this text is that entitlement ends

843
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,380
 where gratitude begins.

844
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,980
 And I know that sounds like just a pithy line,

845
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,300
 and oh yeah, that's great, I'll tweet that.

846
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,020
 Entitlement, truly, it ends where gratitude begins.

847
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,060
 That their response would have been radically different

848
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:40,100
 than just said, man, this landowner is incredibly good.

849
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,020
 How amazing is this guy?

850
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,740
 In the same way that our response, entitlement ends

851
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,920
 when we just look at God and go,

852
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,060
 God, you're so good to me inside of my life.

853
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,780
 I'm just overwhelmed with all the ways

854
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,660
 that I wanna thank you.

855
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,580
 The scripture says that everything good inside of your life

856
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,800
 and inside of my life comes down

857
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,580
 from the heavenly Father of lights, James chapter one.

858
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,060
 It says that everything good in your life and in my life

859
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,780
 is a gift from God himself.

860
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,600
 And you might be thinking like,

861
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,300
 man, do I really have like a ton to be thankful for?

862
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,100
 Do I really have a ton that I should be,

863
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,860
 have an attitude where I'm just grateful?

864
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,500
 I mean, think about the last 24 hours of your life.

865
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,640
 I mean, think about all, and if you're like,

866
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,940
 yeah, it's been really hard, honestly.

867
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,920
 I don't love my job that much.

868
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,580
 The internet's out at our apartment, and I'm,

869
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,260
 I mean, think about like even the fact

870
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,860
 that many of you drove a car into work here.

871
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,700
 Many of you today, you had heat inside of your office

872
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,540
 building or inside of the home that you live in,

873
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,300
 and there's all kinds of different things that had you.

874
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,920
 If we could trade places with the King of England

875
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,120
 200 years ago, he would be like,

876
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,840
 oh my gosh, I would give anything to experience

877
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,240
 the life that you guys live.

878
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,320
 With the touch of a button,

879
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,200
 you can access endless information of the world around you

880
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,960
 and answers to any question you may have.

881
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,000
 You can push a dial and it controls the environment

882
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,720
 or the heat inside of a room.

883
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,840
 For many people, you guys walked across the parking lot

884
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,080
 and you're like, yeah, it was really far.

885
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,760
 You have legs that move.

886
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,880
 Think about how many people inside of the world

887
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,640
 would just say, gosh, I would love to be able

888
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,720
 to have the health to walk that distance again.

889
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,440
 There's a video that a church did over the holiday season

890
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,720
 that just captured, honestly,

891
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,520
 the power of just the attitude of thankfulness

892
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,400
 and how much we take for granted.

893
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,880
 And the guys are gonna throw it at a church

894
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,200
 out of North Carolina, and they just displayed as well

895
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,160
 as really I could say it.

896
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,460
 So you guys watch this.

897
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,040
 (upbeat music)

898
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,600
 I'm alive.

899
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,600
 I'm alive.

900
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,180
 (upbeat music)

901
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:40,760
 Hey, Christine, you're here too.

902
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,640
 I love you.

903
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,480
 - I know.

904
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
 - Dad, what's happening?

905
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,160
 - Honey, the power works.

906
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,200
 It's going, it goes on and off whenever we want.

907
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,200
 We've got clean water.

908
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,200
 - That's great, look at that.

909
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,200
 - Ooh, I bet I know what this does.

910
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,720
 - Rain down the glorious water.

911
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,360
 - Ha, shoes.

912
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,940
 Oh, what do we got here, guys?

913
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,800
 Food.

914
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,640
 - Mm, I love food.

915
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,220
 What, a toothpaste?

916
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,280
 We might have work.

917
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,880
 This is awesome.

918
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,800
 Come on, let's get here.

919
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,960
 - Hey, the what?

920
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,120
 - Doug, be careful.

921
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,800
 - Ooh, I have a car.

922
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,480
 Did you guys see this?

923
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,800
 - Yeah, you have a car.

924
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,640
 - A car.

925
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,480
 - A car.

926
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,520
 (laughing)

927
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,080
 - And don't forget your coffee.

928
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,440
 - You're the best.

929
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,020
 (upbeat music)

930
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:56,640
 (laughing)

931
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,440
 - Oh, man.

932
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,840
 I love it.

933
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,640
 Our parking team is right now wrapping

934
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,320
 every single one of your cars in the parking lot,

935
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,160
 just to show you.

936
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,480
 (laughing)

937
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,400
 What if they were?

938
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,000
 Can't believe we have to do this.

939
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,840
 I mean, it's a silly video, but it's powerful.

940
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,600
 You think about, man, just all the things

941
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,040
 that we take for granted that our heart

942
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,040
 immediately doesn't go, gosh, man, I'm overwhelmed.

943
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,360
 Lord, thank you for the gifts inside of my life.

944
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,160
 I mean, it's just such a better way to live

945
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,600
 when you allow your heart to continue.

946
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,360
 There's something that happens inside of my heart

947
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,600
 when I spend time just thanking God

948
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,160
 for the things that he's given me inside of my life,

949
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,440
 even especially maybe when I allow circumstances

950
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,560
 where I'm like, gosh, my car just broke down,

951
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,800
 and I, in healthy moments, just go,

952
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,120
 Lord, thank you for a car that can break down.

953
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,280
 Less than 1% of the world even owns a car,

954
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,560
 and I have a car, so thank you that I even have a car

955
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,400
 that can break down.

956
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,480
 Lord, thank you that I have a sore throat,

957
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,280
 because it reminds me, sickness can remind me

958
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,960
 of how good it is to not be sick and to be healthy

959
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,480
 and how often that is the case.

960
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,520
 There's just something, it's a better way to live.

961
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,120
 And people who embrace just this attitude of,

962
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,360
 Lord, I'm gonna be grateful,

963
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,140
 and they practice gratitude towards God

964
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,180
 and gratefulness towards others,

965
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,080
 they're like, it's hard to get those people bogged down.

966
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,520
 Their life is filled with more joy.

967
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,720
 If you wanna have more joy,

968
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,040
 and I'm gonna give you practical things,

969
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,680
 or two practical things that I want you to do,

970
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,960
 begin to practice thanking God

971
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,480
 for the things inside of your life.

972
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,800
 I mean, it just does something to our heart.

973
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,360
 It tunes our heart.

974
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:35,240
 And it moves us more towards worshiping God.

975
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,780
 Inside of our house, one of the most common ways

976
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,880
 that we pray at our family dinner tables,

977
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,760
 we say five things we're thankful for.

978
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,600
 That's how we're gonna pray.

979
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,740
 Five things, go.

980
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:47,740
 Men, water, the dog, a wife that is just incredible.

981
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,760
 Lord, thank you for food, thank you for Jesus.

982
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,120
 And it does something to your heart.

983
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,380
 If you wanna have more joy tomorrow,

984
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,900
 practice thanking God, thanking others.

985
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,200
 If you wanna be depressed, continue to be entitled

986
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,140
 and think that everything that you have inside of your life,

987
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,060
 you earned, you're owed, you deserve.

988
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,240
 Practically last week, we said,

989
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,360
 hey, we're gonna invite you, if you want to,

990
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,440
 for the next 30 days.

991
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,080
 Hey, wake up 30 minutes early with us.

992
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,580
 You can go to jointhejourney.com

993
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,080
 and join us in kind of this Devo that we're doing,

994
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,920
 where we're just waking up,

995
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,800
 studying God's word for our staff.

996
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,640
 We do Join the Journey,

997
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,640
 but whatever that looks like for you,

998
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,480
 and we invited you to, hey, wake up 30 minutes earlier.

999
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,360
 Now, as an add-on to that,

1000
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,500
 here's something you can add on to it.

1001
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,280
 Begin your time of studying God's word

1002
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,320
 by just writing out or just praying out

1003
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,560
 five things I'm thankful for.

1004
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,600
 God, thank you for this.

1005
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,360
 It does something in the inside of your heart.

1006
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,120
 And it moves you in the direction of the person

1007
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,200
 that you want to be, of a life that's more filled with joy.

1008
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,880
 And so we wanna invite you, five things.

1009
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,280
 As you begin, do 100 things.

1010
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,600
 Do it, and there's no cap on it,

1011
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,640
 but begin recognizing, Lord, thank you.

1012
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,120
 Thank you for a season of singleness,

1013
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,120
 even if I don't want it,

1014
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,200
 where I can just further use my time

1015
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,400
 to serve the people in the world around you

1016
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,320
 and to grow in my love and knowledge,

1017
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,400
 my relationship with my heavenly Father,

1018
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,840
 to grow in my faith.

1019
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,200
 Whatever those things are,

1020
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,860
 and when you begin to turn what feel like obstacles

1021
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,740
 or challenges, and you flip 'em by thanking God

1022
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,680
 for just whatever's inside of your life, it does something.

1023
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,600
 Some of you, you need to leave here tonight,

1024
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,120
 and you need to reach out and you need to thank somebody.

1025
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,000
 Like someone, your boss, someone that you work with,

1026
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,280
 a family member, that there's just little things

1027
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,440
 inside of your life where you need to reach out

1028
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,280
 and send a text.

1029
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,480
 Imagine if 3,500, or between everyone involved,

1030
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,800
 5,000 people tonight just sent a text to someone,

1031
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,720
 hey, I'm just thanking God for you tonight.

1032
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,160
 I'm just thankful for whatever it is inside of you.

1033
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,980
 Because here's what's crazy about gratefulness

1034
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,320
 and thankfulness to one another.

1035
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,740
 When someone doesn't thank you,

1036
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,000
 like not expressed gratitude,

1037
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,800
 we've all been on the other side of it, right?

1038
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,480
 Like when you do something really hard

1039
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,700
 and they don't thank you,

1040
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,920
 even if they feel thankful inside of their heart,

1041
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,920
 if they don't express it or communicate it, what happens?

1042
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,340
 It's received as they're ungrateful.

1043
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,060
 I mean, think about that.

1044
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:07,360
 That anytime you and I withhold thankfulness

1045
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,840
 towards another person, it is received as ingratitude.

1046
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,160
 It's not just received as, hey, kinda neutral.

1047
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,400
 It's if I work really hard and I plan something for you

1048
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,960
 or I give something to you and you don't say thank you,

1049
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,240
 I'm not like, oh man, it's neutral.

1050
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,600
 It's received as they're ungrateful.

1051
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,920
 They don't care.

1052
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,220
 Some of you, best thing that you need to do

1053
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,600
 is you need to reach out, thank a parent,

1054
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,720
 thank the boss that you work with.

1055
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,240
 Thank your community group, and you're like,

1056
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,160
 oh, they don't need to be thanked,

1057
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,980
 that's just a part of being in community.

1058
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,720
 Those are especially the people that you need to thank.

1059
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,600
 And it does something to you and it does something to me,

1060
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,800
 and I have a hunch that when the body of Christ,

1061
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,760
 and maybe we'll just start here,

1062
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,960
 inside of this room and in Fort Worth

1063
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,160
 and wherever you're listening in,

1064
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,520
 if we unleash on the world just waves and waves

1065
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,380
 of young adults who are filled with not entitlement,

1066
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,640
 like the world around us says, but just gratitude,

1067
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,920
 they can't get bogged down based on circumstances.

1068
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,660
 They're grateful to God to have another day

1069
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,760
 that they weren't promised.

1070
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,320
 It is powerful, and that's what we're gonna do in this city.

1071
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,520
 That's what we hope to see experienced inside of this room,

1072
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,400
 and that's what we hope to experience inside of our own life

1073
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,180
 and it only benefits you.

1074
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,280
 The final reason why entitlement,

1075
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,880
 and I'll land the plan in quotes here, is so dangerous

1076
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,720
 is because it will not just cost you joy or relationships,

1077
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,060
 it will cost you heaven.

1078
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:27,840
 Like if you are not able to get over

1079
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,180
 just an entitlement attitude towards God,

1080
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,640
 it will cost you eternal life.

1081
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,680
 Here's what I mean by that,

1082
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,440
 and I think this is way more prevalent than you think,

1083
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,040
 'cause you're like, who's entitled towards God?

1084
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,320
 The most common belief in the country, I think,

1085
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,320
 maybe in the world, is rooted in an entitlement towards God.

1086
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,780
 What do I mean by that?

1087
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,040
 The most common expression,

1088
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,840
 outside of what the Bible teaches,

1089
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,560
 that maybe if you lumped

1090
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,320
 kind of the major world religions together,

1091
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,440
 people would think, hey, when it comes to me

1092
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,880
 having eternal life with God,

1093
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,200
 if I'm gonna be in heaven or not,

1094
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,080
 it is all based on how good of a person

1095
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,160
 that I think that I am,

1096
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,040
 and if I'm good, I think I deserve heaven.

1097
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,720
 If that is your attitude,

1098
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,320
 like I have a good heart,

1099
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,140
 and I've done good things,

1100
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,160
 and I try to live a good life,

1101
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,760
 you are entitled towards God,

1102
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,920
 you are not a Christian,

1103
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,400
 you don't know what the Bible teaches,

1104
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,280
 or at least you're not believing what the Bible teaches.

1105
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,920
 The message of Christianity is not that,

1106
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,800
 hey, if you try and you're a good person,

1107
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,680
 then you have eternal life.

1108
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,900
 I was talking to a friend last week,

1109
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,920
 and we were talking through just faith,

1110
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,120
 and I asked him the two questions,

1111
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,120
 or these two questions of,

1112
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,560
 man, if something happened to you today,

1113
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,680
 like you died, and hopefully that doesn't happen,

1114
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,160
 but if it happened, on a scale of one to 10,

1115
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,200
 how confident are you that you would go to heaven?

1116
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,040
 And he said, you know,

1117
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,200
 I think I'm probably like an eight or a nine.

1118
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,820
 And I said, why?

1119
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,600
 And he said, because I have a good heart.

1120
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,700
 Like I've always had a good heart,

1121
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,840
 like I look back, and I've always,

1122
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,040
 you know, I've always wanted to help people,

1123
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,320
 I've got a heart to help people,

1124
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,360
 you know, if somebody was in need,

1125
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,720
 I would give them my last $15,

1126
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,680
 I would give them whatever they needed,

1127
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,640
 you know, like I've always had a heart to care for people,

1128
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,420
 and I had to look him in the eyes and say,

1129
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,560
 you're not a Christian.

1130
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,280
 That's not the message of Christianity.

1131
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,040
 And we walked through that the message of Christianity

1132
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,060
 is not that, man, I'm a good person, so I deserve God,

1133
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:14,160
 I am entitled to heaven because of me.

1134
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,040
 The message of Christianity is that

1135
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,120
 I'm not entitled to anything but hell.

1136
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,380
 But the God who is there loved me so much

1137
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,500
 that he died in my place, he made a way for me.

1138
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,720
 And that anyone who doesn't say,

1139
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,160
 look, I'm entitled, and I'm gonna try,

1140
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,120
 and I'm gonna work really hard,

1141
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,060
 but anyone who says, I've come to the place

1142
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,220
 where I know that I can't save myself,

1143
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,720
 I'm not deserving of a relationship with you, God.

1144
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,220
 You're perfect, you're holy, you're sinless.

1145
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,060
 You're everything that I wish that I was, but I'm not.

1146
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,520
 And if the basis for me ever getting to heaven

1147
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,120
 is gonna be based on I have a good heart,

1148
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,760
 and I've tried really hard, and I pay my taxes,

1149
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,200
 and I go to church, I'm never going to get there

1150
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,680
 according to Jesus, according to the Bible.

1151
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:57,120
 And if that's what you believe right now,

1152
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,280
 the God who is there has brought you sovereignly

1153
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,120
 into this room, and into the room in Fort Worth,

1154
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,560
 and into the room in El Paso, in Tulsa,

1155
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,560
 everywhere that you are, listen to me very closely.

1156
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,660
 If that is what you believe,

1157
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,640
 the God who's there has sovereignly brought you.

1158
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,480
 He wove the pieces, he had a friend invite you,

1159
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,740
 he brought you into this room right now

1160
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,060
 for the moment that you could hear

1161
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:17,260
 the message of Christianity is not work your way to God,

1162
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,600
 it is God has worked his way for you,

1163
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,040
 and died in your place on the cross.

1164
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,280
 And if you will accept the free gift,

1165
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,160
 what does it mean to accept,

1166
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,240
 what does it mean to have a gift?

1167
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,240
 It means that you're not deserving of it.

1168
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,720
 If you deserve it, that's called a payment.

1169
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,680
 It's a gift, if you will accept,

1170
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,560
 not by what you do, but by his grace,

1171
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,100
 or just by faith in what he did.

1172
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:41,400
 I'm trusting, God, you paid for my sin.

1173
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,260
 Every time I've smoked marijuana,

1174
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,620
 every look at pornography I've done,

1175
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,280
 every time that I was in that affair,

1176
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,640
 every action of anger,

1177
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,520
 every time that I've gotten hammered on the weekend,

1178
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,260
 or hammered last night, you paid for it.

1179
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,620
 And if I'm gonna have a relationship with you,

1180
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:00,040
 it's gonna not be because I deserve it, 'cause I don't.

1181
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,560
 That person, Jesus says,

1182
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,120
 whoever comes to the end of themselves,

1183
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,120
 they can have the gift.

1184
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,840
 If they'll just say, God, I accept it.

1185
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,400
 The God who's there is crazy about you,

1186
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,120
 loves you enough to die in your place,

1187
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,420
 I'll give my life for you.

1188
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:21,240
 So that you would be brought into his family,

1189
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,600
 not because you deserve it,

1190
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,720
 but despite the fact that you didn't,

1191
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,520
 and I didn't, being entitled.

1192
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,320
 Will rob you of joy, it'll kill your relationships.

1193
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:38,320
 And it will keep you out of heaven,

1194
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,080
 but it doesn't have to.

1195
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:45,080
 If you'll accept freely what Jesus did for you,

1196
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,480
 like so many of us have.

1197
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,640
 Let me pray.

1198
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,160
 Father, thank you.

1199
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,480
 Seems like

1200
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,300
 embarrassingly small.

1201
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:09,580
 To say to the God who created the universe,

1202
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,500
 who's perfect and holy,

1203
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,960
 who's righteous in every single way,

1204
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,240
 worthy of every worship,

1205
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,160
 worthy of every breath that any of us breathes in here,

1206
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,000
 and yet you would decide,

1207
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,160
 because of your love for us,

1208
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,140
 that you would become a man,

1209
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,920
 enter into our world, die for our sins,

1210
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:39,800
 despite the fact that we're entitled, angry, addicts.

1211
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,480
 Father, I pray for anyone inside of this room

1212
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,040
 who's never stepped into a relationship with a God

1213
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,360
 who wants to know them,

1214
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,000
 and is so reckless in his love

1215
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,120
 that he'll kick down any door for them to know it,

1216
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,880
 that tonight you would break the walls of entitlement down,

1217
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,720
 that they would be exposed to the lie.

1218
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:04,580
 They don't deserve heaven, and neither do I.

1219
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:10,040
 But the one who did, Jesus,

1220
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,240
 gave his life so that they could experience heaven.

1221
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,440
 Father, would you kill the entitlement in our hearts?

1222
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,280
 Would you breed gratitude in us?

1223
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,840
 Would we be a thankful people?

1224
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,960
 Would we see all the incredible gifts that you give us?

1225
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,220
 And Lord, should you give us another day?

1226
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,440
 Would we wake up tomorrow with hearts full of worship

1227
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,400
 and gratitude towards you, our King?

1228
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,640
 Thank you, Lord, for the million things

1229
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,880
 I take for granted every single day,

1230
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,960
 and thank you most of all for sending your Son,

1231
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,640
 for me, for my friends, for anyone who will accept it.

1232
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,460
 Amen.
