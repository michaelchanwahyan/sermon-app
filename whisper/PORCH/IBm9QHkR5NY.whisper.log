[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700]   Good evening and welcome to the porch.
[00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.040]   I'm here to guide you on your journey through the complex world of relationships.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.920]   Can we cue some music please?
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.760]   From our friendships to our romantic endeavors, we'll explore our family bonds, estranged
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.360]   relationships, work dynamics, and perhaps even the relationship with oneself.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.720]   So how do we relate?
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.160]   To answer this, we'll look to scripture and find exactly what God has to say about our
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.680]   relationships.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.040]   This is, after all, the Relationship Series.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.040]   Alright.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.800]   Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.800]   We doing okay tonight?
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.800]   Yeah?
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.440]   It's great to see you.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.520]   Special shout out to Porch Live, everybody that's tuning in online.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.400]   We don't take it for granted that you would be here with us this evening.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.640]   Listen, I've said this before, just talking to those of you online, we genuinely believe
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.080]   that God can meet with anyone at any time and in any place, and that includes you, right
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.080]   where you are.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.600]   So we believe, man.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.400]   God's got something special for those of you here in the room, but he's also got something
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.160]   special in store for you as well.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.560]   Special shout out to Porch Live, Midland, Dayton, and Indianapolis.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.080]   Well, I'll never forget showing up to Texas A&M as a freshman.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.840]   Alright.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.440]   We love the rest of you too.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.160]   It was my first time moving to a new city, which brought a few new realities to me.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.040]   I was showing up into an environment where I had more freedom than I had ever known before.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.480]   No one knew me at all, which meant I could reinvent myself entirely.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.320]   And because no one knew me at all, it meant I had no friends yet.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.400]   And so as I make my way to College Station, I see my brother and I'm like, "Hey man, like
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.400]   I need to get plugged in.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.960]   Like it's important for me to kind of get my feet settled, begin to put roots down and
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.240]   feel like I can spread myself around and meet other folks."
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.120]   So how is it that I do this in a brand new town?
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.800]   And he looked at me and said, "Well, there's this thing that happens at the student center
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.920]   where all of the organizations on campus gather together and it's the perfect place to meet
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.920]   people."
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920]   And I thought, "Perfect.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.920]   Like that's exactly what I want.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.080]   This is going to be a group of people, freshmen, just like me that have no friends that are
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.080]   showing up.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.840]   They're trying to find those that they'll do life alongside and they can call there
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.440]   for everybody's into the future.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.440]   So let's do it.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.440]   This sounds perfect."
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.080]   So I make my way to this event.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.040]   And as I get to this open house, what I find awaiting me there at the front door is something
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.400]   the likes of which I did not expect.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:41.440]   I found more than 800 student organizations, little communities of people that were all
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.160]   buying to bind themselves together.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.720]   And in the time since, I think it's north of a thousand at this point, which told me
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.500]   a few things about the human race.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.720]   You know, as I consider the organizations there amongst that event, I saw the usual
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.720]   suspects.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.160]   I saw your sororities and your fraternities and your business organizations, the engineering
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.920]   clubs and all your student government groups.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.320]   I saw the usual suspects and I also saw the not so usual suspects.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.960]   I saw the undergraduate beekeepers society.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.280]   I saw the live action role-playing enthusiasts.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.720]   I even saw the happiness club, you know, which I almost looked an application in for because
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.680]   that sounds like a good time.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:30.340]   There was a wide variety of people all gathered together seeking after the same thing.
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.760]   You see, despite our varying differences, and some of us have some differences, what
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.940]   I noticed in that moment is everyone is looking for someone because everybody wants to be
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.440]   connected.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.460]   Everybody wants to be connected.
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.860]   Author Sebastian Junger said, "Human beings need three basic things in order to be content.
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.600]   They need to feel competent in what they do, they need to feel authentic in their lives,
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.860]   and they need to feel connected to others."
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.440]   These values are considered intrinsic to human happiness and they far outweigh extrinsic
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.820]   values such as beauty, money, and status, which interestingly are kind of the crux of
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.500]   the young adult experience.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.460]   And yet what he just said is more important than your appearance and your success and
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.740]   your reputation, what's more important than any of that is your connection to other people.
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.060]   We need each other.
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.520]   You know it, I know it, and God knows it.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.920]   It says so in Ecclesiastes chapter four, it says, "Two are better than one because they
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.020]   have good reward for their toil.
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.240]   For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow, but woe to him who is alone when he falls
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.440]   and has not another to lift him up."
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.040]   Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone?
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.040]   Brr.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.780]   And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him.
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.300]   A threefold cord is not quickly broken.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.380]   So the question is not do we need each other?
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.420]   The question instead is how do we relate to each other?
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.740]   Because the reality of it is all of us as we navigate life are going to find ourselves
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.080]   in a variety of different relationships.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.720]   Some of you right now, you're investing in deep friendships.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.220]   Those lifelong friends that you anticipate standing next to you on your wedding day.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.740]   Others of you are working on that wedding day.
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.380]   You're dating that romantic interest and you're spending considerate time and you're trying
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.780]   to thoughtfully learn about them.
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.260]   And the closest thing to a romantic relationship some of you have is the relationship to your
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.260]   job, right?
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.660]   And so you're spending all of your time sitting in your office grinding away for the man.
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.680]   All of us, regardless of what relationship you're engaged with, are engaging in some
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.200]   kind of relationship.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.740]   And so the question then is how do we relate to them all?
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.080]   That's what this series is about.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.460]   That's what we wanted to unpack over the course of the next several weeks.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.060]   We wanted to help you understand how is it that we as human beings are meant to connect
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.060]   to each other.
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.260]   And tonight we're cracking the lid on that relationship, which has brought so many of
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.780]   you here into this room right now.
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.780]   Friendship.
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.780]   That's what we're talking about this evening.
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.860]   In case you didn't see it, we're talking about friends.
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.860]   That's where we're going.
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.520]   I want to give you a theology of friendship.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.420]   And the way that I want to do it is I want to walk through it in three different sections.
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.580]   I want to talk to you about why does friendship matter, how does friendship grow, and what
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.520]   does friendship look like?
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.520]   So why does friendship matter?
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.860]   Well, C.S. Lewis said that friendship is unnecessary.
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.620]   It's like philosophy and it's like art.
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.140]   It has no survival value.
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:38.900]   Rather, it is one of those things that gives value to survival.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.580]   I was doing some research because I was curious.
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:48.420]   What is the average first age which we find our very first friendship?
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.420]   Like what is the age?
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.300]   And when you do the research, what you see is that it's three to four years old, which
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.900]   ratifies everything C.S. just said.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.040]   Because at three to four years old, you're not relying on the friends in your life to
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.540]   help you survive.
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.540]   You've got your parents for that.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.260]   And even if you did rely on your peers at that point, they wouldn't do much of any good
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.260]   for you, right?
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.260]   No.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.620]   Why then at such an early age are we pursuing friendship?
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.180]   Why does friendship matter?
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.920]   For this reason, life isn't meant to be endured.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.040]   It's meant to be enjoyed.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.700]   Life isn't meant to be endured.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.700]   It's meant to be enjoyed.
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.900]   And listen, some of you are here tonight and that's the truth that God wanted to give to
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.340]   you because all you've been doing is enduring.
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.740]   You're just trying to get through the day.
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.860]   You're just trying to make it through the week.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:40.380]   And God's saying, son, daughter, I have more for you than that.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.380]   I have more.
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.300]   And friends help with this reality.
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:50.540]   If you think about it, God doesn't primarily give you friends for your development.
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.980]   He has his church for that.
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:57.900]   God doesn't primarily give you friends for your accountability because he has community
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.900]   for that.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:04.860]   He doesn't primarily give you friends for your godliness because he has his word for
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:05.860]   that.
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.260]   Now, he uses friends for all of those things.
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.820]   Do not mistake what I'm saying.
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:15.980]   Friends absolutely help with everything I just described, but friends are not predominantly
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.380]   nor primarily intended to those ends.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:26.460]   So what reason then does God primarily intend for us to have friends in life?
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.300]   Joy.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.860]   Joy.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.140]   Which just says something really awesome about God, right?
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:39.820]   That he would look upon us and he would say, I not only in care for you to exist, I not
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:45.020]   only in, I not only care for you to survive, I want you to thrive.
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.620]   I want you to enjoy everything that I have.
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:54.340]   And I've given you some friends, some people, some peers that you can enjoy as well.
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.660]   Proverbs 27, 9 says, perfume and incense bring joy to the heart and the pleasantness of a
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:04.020]   friend springs from their heartfelt advice.
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.360]   God is so for you.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.940]   He is so for you that he is for your satisfaction in life, that he created a relationship that
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:18.340]   principally exists for your enjoyment, something that Cambridge dictionary agrees with vehemently.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:23.540]   It defines a friend as a person who you know well and who you like a lot, but who is usually
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.340]   not a member of your family, which I think is a really funny addition, right?
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.100]   Like they can't be a part of your family according to Cambridge.
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.040]   We can agree to disagree on that.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.040]   Talk about it later.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.340]   But what Cambridge is pointing to is that these are people who you like a lot.
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.900]   And remarkably, we agree with this.
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:44.460]   I was looking at a research study done by Pew Research Center that just October of last
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.260]   year, they were assessing the state of friendship here in America.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.440]   And what they found is they polled those who agreed to having at least one close friend,
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.580]   which is like 91% of people.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.740]   It's the vast majority of people say, man, I've at least got one close friend.
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:06.460]   As they were doing their poll, what they found is that 72%, so three out of four of people,
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:13.140]   72% of those that agreed to having a close friend said they were deeply satisfied with
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.380]   at least one of those friends, deeply satisfied.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.820]   And as I read that data, I was like, maybe I don't need to do this talk.
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.780]   Like it seems like friendships are great.
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:31.900]   Things are going well until I kept doing research and I found that in the lives of 18 to 34
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:40.820]   year olds, 30% of you, so just a third of this room, also attest to experiencing loneliness
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:47.260]   every day, or at least several times a week, which is deeply concerning when you consider
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.060]   the effects of loneliness in the life of a person.
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.540]   Because according to the CDC, loneliness has been linked to an increased risk of heart
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:11:01.860]   disease, stroke, type two diabetes, depression, anxiety, addiction, dementia, and even early
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.660]   death.
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:10.260]   One meta-analysis of 70 different studies found that the effects of loneliness on one's
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:20.220]   longevity in life had the same impact as severe obesity and smoking 15 cigarettes a day.
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.460]   And some of you here tonight are really lonely.
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.940]   Some of you here tonight are in fact here tonight because you're looking to cure and
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.140]   curb your loneliness.
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.140]   You're trying to find friends.
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.760]   Let me just say, I just want to speak to those of you here that would identify with everything
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.760]   I just described.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.160]   One, we're really glad you're here.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.540]   You're in the right spot.
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.500]   This is a great place to find friends.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:49.460]   But I also know that some of you have been here before and you have made the effort and
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:54.020]   you have extended a hand and you've introduced yourself already and yet it doesn't seem like
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.660]   you can find and be friends in this place.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.480]   And that can be so very frustrating.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.520]   To you, I want to say, do not lose hope.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.540]   Would you come talk to us?
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:10.540]   And then thirdly, the way you find friends is by being a friend.
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.480]   That's the greatest advice I could give to you.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.660]   And we've got a lot more than we want to talk about on the topic of friendship.
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.620]   But I just wanted to say that briefly.
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.060]   So what's my point with all this?
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.420]   The idea that many of us would say, I'm deeply satisfied with my friends and I'm so lonely
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.920]   at the same time.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.020]   What is the point?
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:29.100]   Like, why do I make all of this space to talk about this right now?
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.860]   Because I think it's helpful for us to set up the fact that many of us are living in
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:40.020]   what the Bible would describe is essentially an impossible situation because friendship
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:46.900]   is the presence of meaningful connection while loneliness is the absence of meaningful connection.
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:53.820]   To say you're living in both at the same time is to say that your experience is an oxymoron.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.840]   That somehow you're alone and yet you're still together.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.840]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:07.140]   And so we need to grasp hold of what then is our misunderstanding of friendship because
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.140]   God wants more for us.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.780]   Like the reason which we can say I'm deeply connected and I'm deeply alone is because
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:18.820]   we don't quite understand what God means by friendship when he begins to unpack it.
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.500]   And so that's what I want us to walk through.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:27.780]   I want us to grasp hold of what God says should be socially true of those that engage with
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.980]   the friends in their life.
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:37.660]   And here's the thing, this idea of friendship, that man, maybe we got something wrong.
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.340]   We would honestly agree with this.
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.980]   Like, just think about the way that you talk about friends in your life.
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.500]   Like this is a word that we just kind of throw around.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:48.200]   We just kind of lay it upon any and every person in our sphere of influence.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.220]   So much so that we even have begun to qualify the types of friends in our life.
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.540]   That we have best friends and we have close friends and we have work friends and we have
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:59.980]   family friends and we have friends that we see every now and again and that person's
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.180]   just a friend.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.060]   I remember when I was in college, I was dating a girl.
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.060]   I met her family and she introduced me as her good friend.
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.820]   That told me everything I needed to know in the moment.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.260]   I knew immediately where we stood.
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.540]   Like, I don't need to be your boyfriend, but can we at least get a, we're very close friends,
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.700]   mom and dad, you know, like that would have been great.
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.340]   Would have been extremely edifying.
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:27.220]   And yet the point still remains that we do this because we will know that not every friendship
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:32.980]   contains the same depth of intimacy or commitment as another.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.020]   And while casual friends, they're inevitable and they're good, they can even be joy filled.
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.540]   My thing that I want you to grasp tonight is I feel that we have lost a deep level of
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:49.000]   intimacy and intentionality that God intends for you to have with the friends in your life.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.760]   The Bible even says that we have a discrepancy with the types of friendships we experience.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:15:01.060]   It says in Proverbs 18, 24, a man of many companions comes to ruin, but there's a friend
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.980]   who sticks closer than a brother.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:08.020]   Like it's possible to have many companions, literally a whole company of friends and still
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.020]   come to ruin.
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:14.860]   And some of you get this, like you've invested deeply into the friendships of your life.
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:21.060]   And yet you've been betrayed by something someone did, or you've been slandered by something
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.180]   someone said.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:31.060]   Some of you are so desperate, so desirous of that group of people that the cost to admission
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:38.020]   is moral compromise, not just one time, not just two times, but every single time.
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.680]   Your many companions has brought you to ruin and yet the Bible is sitting here.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.100]   God is sitting here and he's saying, I have more for you.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.580]   There's something better than that.
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.020]   There's a friend that sticks closer than a brother.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.780]   There's a friend that's closer than even blood.
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.180]   So how then do we build that kind of friendship?
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.140]   How do we grow that kind of friendship?
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:03.700]   Well, the Hebrew word for friend in that verse in Proverbs 18, 24 is the word Ahava.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.380]   When it says there's a friend that sticks closer than a brother, friend is the word
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:08.380]   Ahava.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.380]   Say it with me.
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.380]   Ahava.
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:17.980]   And what it means when it says it throughout the old Testament is it's talking about love.
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.820]   And the thing about Ahava is it's a particular kind of love.
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.020]   Like it's a general sort of affection.
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:29.860]   And yet what you know about Ahava is that it is always an invisible affection that becomes
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.700]   visible action.
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.780]   So just to help you grasp this, when I was in college, not to just keep telling college
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:42.680]   stories, but when I was in school, I thought that I wanted to study accounting, which makes
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.940]   no sense knowing myself today.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.420]   I don't know why I would choose to do that.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.220]   That has always been horrible at math.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.020]   It doesn't make any sense that I would ever sign up for that.
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.580]   But at the time it made perfect sense because if you looked at the accounting program, it
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.780]   was really good.
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.820]   If you looked at their job placement, it was really great.
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.140]   And if you looked at the earning potential, like that sounds awesome.
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.740]   I would love to make the kind of money those people make.
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.820]   And so I thought accounting was exactly what I wanted to do.
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:09.820]   The only thing is I hated it.
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.900]   I hated, I hated learning it.
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.260]   I hated studying for it.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.020]   I hated testing for it.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:20.180]   So while the idea of accounting was something I loved, I had no Ahava for it.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.940]   It did not change the way that I lived my life.
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.780]   True, deep biblical friendship has Ahava.
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.940]   And the reason we know that is because we see it in the story of Jonathan and David
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.160]   in 1 Samuel chapter 18.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:38.060]   So if you have a Bible, you can turn with me to 1 Samuel chapter 18.
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.860]   This is really where we're going to be over the course of the remainder of the evening.
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.420]   We're going to look at a bunch of different scriptures.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.460]   We'll have them up on the screens for you, but we're going to look at kind of 18, 19,
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.460]   20.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.460]   We'll jump to 23 at one point.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.820]   So if you just put your finger there, we'll be able to track along with the rest of the
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.820]   message.
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.500]   But everything we've done up to this point is set up, which freaks some of you out because
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.740]   you're like, Oh my gosh, I can't believe it.
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.300]   We've been into this thing for 18 minutes already.
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.940]   And you're just now getting into the meat of your message.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.940]   Calm down.
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:01.940]   You're going to be okay.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.940]   All right.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.820]   Your friends will still be here by the end of this thing, Lord willing.
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:14.360]   What I want us to do is I want us to look at the Bible's greatest example of true friendship
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.220]   next to Jesus's friendship to you and I.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:20.420]   Jonathan and David have the best case for us to study.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:26.020]   And so what I want is I want us to look at their friendship and learn for our own.
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:31.060]   And so it says this in first Samuel chapter 18, picking it up in verse one, it says, as
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:35.740]   soon as he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.860]   of David and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.780]   And Saul took him that day and would not let him return to his father's house.
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.660]   And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as his own soul.
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.860]   So how do friendships grow?
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.900]   The deeper the conviction, the deeper the connection.
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.420]   The deeper the conviction, the deeper the connection.
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:03.060]   It's easy to read this and just assume, man, Jonathan and David, they're close.
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.060]   Okay, move on.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.060]   Turn the page.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.060]   Let's keep going.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.620]   And yet what we need to understand is this is a very unlikely friendship.
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.500]   Like these guys are not from the same spheres of influence.
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:19.580]   Like one of them was raised in royalty while the other was raised in poverty.
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.140]   One had white-collar parents.
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.100]   The other came from a blue-collar crowd.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:30.120]   One of them only knew popularity while the other lived in obscurity.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:35.500]   One of them learned within the palace's own walls while the other picked up his tools
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.600]   of the trade from the field around.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.340]   Like they were absolute opposites.
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:46.820]   And yet what we see is this unlikely friendship has a really unbreakable bond.
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:50.980]   Like when the Hebrew says that they were knit to one another, the word there literally means
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.020]   they were chained to one another.
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:58.700]   Like there was an unbreakable force that united the two of these guys to one another.
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.700]   Why is that?
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.340]   Like why does that happen for these two?
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:09.420]   Because they had an abnormal affection and an uncommon commitment to the things of God.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.460]   They had an abnormal affection for the things of God.
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:16.700]   They loved God in a way that was abnormal to the rest of the world.
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:21.140]   Like when people would look at them, they would say, "Man, just dictated by the evidence
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:25.020]   of your life, you love God like you wouldn't believe.
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.460]   That is crazy."
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.340]   But they also had an uncommon commitment.
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.500]   They were uncommon in the way that they would faithfully follow whatever it was that God
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.500]   wanted them to do.
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.800]   They had an abnormal affection and an uncommon commitment to the things of God.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.260]   We see it in their origin story.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.620]   Like if you turn to 1 Samuel 14, we get the first real account of Jonathan's life.
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.580]   And what we see is everything I just described.
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.300]   Like him and his armor bearer, they see the enemies of God, the Philistines, and what
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:57.660]   they decide is to climb some cliffs and lay siege to a garrison, which was stupid.
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.300]   Like that's a suicide mission.
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:05.860]   Like a garrison was a defensive military outpost that was established to protect conquered
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.220]   enemy territory.
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:13.100]   And what we see from the story is as they make their way up, the garrison sees them.
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:18.460]   Like, "Hey guys, we see there's two of you.
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.340]   We're a select defensive fighting force."
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.340]   "Yeah, we know man.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.340]   Can we come up?"
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.340]   "For sure."
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.340]   "All right.
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.340]   Yeah, that sounds great."
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.340]   It didn't make any sense whatsoever.
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:33.060]   And yet Jonathan said, "If they call us up, then the Lord has given them into our hand.
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.060]   Let us go up then."
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:39.580]   And so he and his armor bearer, they ascend and it says that he kills 20 Philistines and
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.300]   they lay siege to the garrison.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:45.100]   And with a little help from God who throws in an earthquake, the entire Philistinian
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.860]   army panics.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.220]   It's something like 30,000 to 600 between the Philistines and the Israelites and the
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.140]   Israelites win.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.420]   David has a similarly insane story.
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.500]   In 1 Samuel chapter 17, you see he goes up against a guy by the name of Goliath, the
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.500]   Philistinian champion.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.980]   We won't get into all the details of Goliath, but he was a big bad.
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.900]   And David steps up when no one else would.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:13.540]   And with but a sling and a stone, he drops him without even using his four other bullets.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:21.380]   Like the guy, these two guys, they were willing to risk everything, including their very own
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.540]   lives because they so believed in God.
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.340]   They believe big in God.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:32.380]   And so they wanted to do whatever it took to live their lives in a way where that abnormal
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:39.740]   affection and that uncommon commitment drove them not just forward, but eventually together.
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:40.740]   Like that's what we see.
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:45.740]   What we learn is the bedrock of their belief in God, the bedrock of their belief became
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:49.780]   the bedrock of their bond to one another.
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.220]   I love the way author Dr. Kent Hughes says it.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:58.700]   He says a Christian friendship exceeds anything that exists in the world.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:04.620]   For such a friendship is founded on a supernatural mutuality of soul.
[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:10.380]   The Holy Spirit makes your souls course the same cries you ascent to the same authority.
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.680]   You know the same God, you're going the same way.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.460]   You long for the same things.
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.200]   You dream mutual dreams.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:23.660]   You yearn for the same experiences of holiness and worship.
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.820]   You know when this happens and this is wonderful.
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:37.620]   I remember another college story, my junior year deciding to join a business organization.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:41.900]   Admittedly, I did not join the organization because I was looking for friends.
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.900]   I joined the organization because I wanted to pad my resume.
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.840]   Like I was arriving at the end of my college tenure and I thought, okay, I need to begin
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:51.700]   to prepare myself to have some credibility as a candidate for a future job.
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:56.300]   It's like as I walk the stage and I make my way out and I step into the real world, I
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:02.140]   want to look the part, earn the role and be okay.
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:06.740]   And so I joined this organization with no intent to find friends.
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:12.660]   And yet as I got into the organization, I met a group of guys and they too were there
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.740]   because they wanted to add to their resume.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:18.660]   But more so than that, they wanted to add to the family of God.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.500]   And as we just sat together and we got to know one another and we shared stories of
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:26.900]   God's goodness in my life, like man, like this is what God has done for me.
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.180]   Oh no, he did the same thing for you.
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.180]   No way.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.100]   Like we just began to share ourselves with one another.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:42.700]   What we found is that as our love for God was expressed, our love for one another exploded.
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:48.500]   This is why it's really powerful when you share your testimony with another person.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:52.620]   Because they're going to see in you a love for God and they're going to see in themselves
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.620]   a love for God.
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.700]   And oh my gosh, man, like this is the making something really special and you're going
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.700]   to find friendship.
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.180]   You know, that was my experience with these guys.
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:03.020]   Like I found friends when I wasn't looking for friends and they just weren't any kind
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.020]   of friend.
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.020]   They were best friends to me.
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:08.380]   The very friends that stood even at my own wedding.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:15.300]   And the reason I tell you that is to just exhort the fact that there's a great power
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:22.260]   and potency in sharing your personal relationship to God with someone else.
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:34.140]   That when you have deep convictions, it'll lead to deep connections.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.540]   Now let me be really clear.
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.820]   Am I saying that you shouldn't befriend people of different religious backgrounds?
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.380]   No, obviously that's not what I'm saying.
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.620]   But I do want to sit here and I just very briefly want to say it is important for you
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:50.220]   to know that you will descend to greater depths and you'll ascend to greater heights and you'll
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:57.940]   find a richer experience of friendship because it will be true friendship if you invest with
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.220]   believers.
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.920]   It's not either or, it's both and.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.140]   But if you look at your sphere of influence, the circles you run in and you don't see anybody
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:12.220]   else that loves God, then something's off and you're robbing yourself of the kind of
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.420]   joy that God wants to give.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.140]   And so this is a good place for you to say, I'm going to get connected tonight.
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.180]   I'm going to figure out what it looks like to plug in.
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:24.940]   Like I do want to continue to walk within my spheres of influence in the circles I have,
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:30.060]   but I also want to step into the types of friendships God wants to give because there's
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:34.180]   more of him in those spaces.
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.700]   John says it like this in 1 John, he agrees at this point.
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:40.840]   He says, beloved, let us love one another for love is from God and whoever loves has
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.000]   been born of God and knows God.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.080]   Anyone who does not love does not know God because God is love.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.320]   No one has ever seen God.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.280]   If we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.120]   What perfects true love?
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.600]   True friendship.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.000]   It's not going to be superficial similarities.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.160]   We have the same hobbies in common.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.600]   We like the same kinds of music.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.780]   We love to travel together.
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:06.160]   It's not going to be superficial similarities and it's not going to be a shared disdain
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.160]   for seclusion.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.480]   I'm so alone.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.480]   You're so alone.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.760]   You want to be alone together?
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.320]   It will be neither of those things.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:19.000]   No, what you need is you need deep substance and substance is found in the spirit.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.240]   It's found in the person of Christ.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:25.080]   You come to him and as you come to him, you'll find them.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.080]   I promise.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:31.040]   Here's what you need to know when you step into these kinds of relationships, when you
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.840]   find this sort of friendship, it looks so wildly different than the rest of the world
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.840]   might expect.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.960]   What I want to do for the remainder of our time is I want to get really practical.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:43.080]   If you're like, okay, I'm ready to learn.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.520]   I want to know how this is supposed to impact my life.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.520]   This is the moment.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:53.760]   So pull your pin, pop the top and take some notes because I want to tell you what friendship
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.120]   is supposed to look like.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.880]   And as we go, I'm going to give you four things.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.080]   The first thing that you need to know is a true friend is loyal.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.920]   A true friend is loyal.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.440]   We see this in the story of David and Jonathan.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.760]   If we jump back into chapter 18 and we look at three and four, we see it says, then Jonathan
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.560]   made a covenant with David because he loved him as his own soul.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.680]   Again, he loved him.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:21.560]   He had an ah of ah for David as his own soul.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.640]   And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and he gave it to David and
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.800]   his armor and even his sword and his bow and his belt.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.240]   Literally the guy gives him the clothes off of his back.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.920]   He looks at David and he says, I'm so for you that I'm going to give you my robe, which
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.200]   is a sign of my provision.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.000]   I'm going to give you my armor, which is a sign of my protection.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.400]   Where you go, I go.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.760]   What you face, I face.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.240]   What you deal with, I deal with.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.240]   I'm yours.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.180]   We're bound to one another.
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.240]   My loyalty lies with you.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.920]   Proverbs 18, 24 says a man of many companions may come to ruin, but there's a friend who
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:59.800]   sticks, who clings, who grasps closer than a brother.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.120]   Like loyal friends, they stick to you.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.480]   They don't bail on you.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:10.120]   Proverbs 17, 17, a friend loves at all times and a brother is born for adversity.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.840]   True friends, they don't run out when the going gets tough.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.960]   Like it doesn't matter how inconveniencing or uncomfortable or overwhelming the situation
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.960]   may be.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.960]   They hang in there.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:24.760]   Like they don't come up with weak excuses whenever you ask for their help.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:32.000]   They don't choose to abandon you just because you become a momentary inconvenience.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   They don't forfeit the friendship just because y'all have fallen on tough times.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.400]   Like this is not the way that loyal friends operate.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:44.120]   Loyal friends say, "Come hell or high water, I'm in it with you.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.760]   I will charge the gates of hell alongside of you.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:52.240]   I will race into whatever's ahead, whatever God intends with you in the heights and in
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.240]   the depths.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.240]   I'm yours."
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.400]   That's what loyal friends say.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.240]   They hang in there.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.600]   They lean in.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.720]   They don't run out.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.640]   They don't give way when others would.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:08.520]   Earlier this year, I called one of my friends who runs an irrigation business.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.320]   I was here in Dallas already.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.520]   Winter weather was coming to my home in Houston.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.720]   Brooke was there and we needed to prepare the house.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.760]   Like things that happened earlier in that year where the weather had gotten bad and
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.760]   pipes had busted.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.400]   And so I was like, "Man, we need to turn the water off."
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.400]   And so I called my buddy.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.200]   I was like, "Hey man, can you swing through and just get our house prepared?"
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.760]   He's like, "Of course I can do that."
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.120]   It's such a simple ask.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:37.960]   That is until Brooke sends me a picture hours later of this good friend of mine covered
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:46.640]   in mud and standing in a hole and plumbing pipes like parts all around him.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.920]   And yet he never told me about it.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:56.920]   And as I stared at that photo, a picture, a literal image of a massive problem in my
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:04.800]   family's life, I also saw the sweet reality of a loyal friend that stood at the dead center
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.640]   of it.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.320]   Do you have a friend like that?
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:13.080]   Are you a friend like that?
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:18.480]   We all need people that are loyal, not people that dodge the difficult, but people that
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.860]   dive right into it.
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.440]   The second thing you need to know is a true friend is honest.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:31.200]   If we jumped to chapter 19, what you need to know between 18 to 19 is Saul, King Saul,
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:38.480]   begins to grow insidiously jealous of David so much so that he wants to take David's life.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:42.880]   And so it says this, "And Saul spoke to Jonathan, his son, and all his servants, that they should
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.000]   kill David.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.720]   But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.480]   And Jonathan told David, 'Saul, my father, seeks to kill you.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.280]   Therefore, be on your guard in the morning.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.920]   Stay in a secret place and hide yourself, and I will go out and stand beside my father
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.520]   in the field where you are, and I will speak to my father about you.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.180]   And if I learned anything, I'll tell you.
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.160]   Talk about some difficult news to relate to your friend.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:09.400]   Hey man, this is kind of hard to explain.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:18.400]   I'm not sure how to break it to you, but my father sort of wants you dead.'"
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.560]   That's a hard piece of news to deliver to a friend.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:28.200]   And yet Jonathan loves his friend so much that he's willing to brave the difficult conversation.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.680]   Proverbs 27, 6 says, "Faithful are the wounds of a friend, profuse are the kisses of an
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.440]   enemy."
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:39.040]   Proverbs 28, 23 says, "Whoever rebukes a man will afterward find more favor than he who
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   flatters with his tongue."
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:46.920]   You see, good friends don't conceal the truth to provide a false sense of security.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.020]   That's not good friendship.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.240]   That's not kind.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:55.680]   Like no one likes to learn that they have food in their teeth, but everyone hates to
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:59.480]   learn that they've had food in their teeth for a long time.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:05.480]   It is better to be honest and upfront than to conceal the truth to preserve their feelings.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.760]   It's better for you to be truthful with them.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.680]   And yet what we know is there's a way we should be truthful.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:17.160]   Like am I saying that because you should be honest, you should see it, you should say
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.520]   it, that you got to give it fast so they get it faster?
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.000]   No, the Bible's not saying that either.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.080]   Proverbs 16, 24 says, "Gracious words are a honeycomb.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.320]   They're sweet to the soul.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.600]   They're healing to the bones."
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.920]   Are your words sweet when you speak them?
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.960]   Do they taste like honey?
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:43.640]   Do people delight to hear from you and return for even more?
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:51.760]   Proverbs 27, 17 says, "Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another."
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:56.320]   Like there's a way to speak that sharpens one another, but there's also a way to speak
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:00.160]   that dulls one another.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.680]   Like how do you sharpen a blade?
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:08.320]   Like when I heard this, I thought, okay, like it sounds like the chef at the Japanese steakhouse
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.880]   who's like working the knives against each other, like he's getting them ready.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.520]   Yet when you study blacksmithing in the Iron Age, which I don't know if you do that, I
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.440]   did that for you, so don't worry, you can rest assured that I'm giving you accurate
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.440]   information.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.040]   What you learn is that's not how they sharpened blades.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:26.360]   You don't sharpen blades with other sharp blades, you sharpen blades with an iron file.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:33.280]   The way that you do it is you take a blade and you carefully and skillfully work it across
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.720]   resistance until it grows sharper.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:44.320]   You see, the process of giving feedback, if iron in fact sharpens iron, means it should
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:47.600]   be careful, it should be considerate.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.720]   That's how we should speak.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:54.560]   We should speak honestly with one another, yes, but we should sharpen with skill.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:58.400]   So we pay attention, not just to the words we say, but we pay attention to the way we
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.120]   say those words.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.920]   And some of you need to know, like you give some thought to the things you're going to
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:10.800]   say, you should give even more thought to the way you're going to say it.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.680]   And it also means that we don't just speak whatever it is we need to share whenever we
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:21.600]   have the time, it also means we speak whatever we need to say whenever they have the time
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.920]   to process it.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.880]   Like, that's kindness.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.200]   We want clarity, but we want kindness.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:33.520]   Like we want to be truthful in our honesty, yet we want to be skillful in our delivery,
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.320]   because a true friend is honest.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.960]   A true friend is trustworthy.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:43.560]   First Samuel chapter 20, if you jump down to 12 verses 13, it says, "And Jonathan said
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:48.600]   to David, 'The Lord, the God of Israel, be witness.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:53.040]   When I have sounded out my Father, when I have listened to him about this time tomorrow
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:58.200]   or the third day, behold, if he is well disposed toward David, shall I not then send and disclose
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.840]   it to you?
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:04.480]   But should it please my Father to do you harm, the Lord do so to Jonathan, and more also,
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:08.560]   if I don't disclose it to you and send it your way, that you may go in safety.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.320]   May the Lord be with you as he has been with my Father.'"
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:19.880]   Like in the face of David's growing fear, as Saul continually pursued his life, we see
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:23.600]   Jonathan, his dear friend, interceding between the two of them.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.200]   He continues to stand in the gap.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.800]   And because he cares so much about David, in this passage, he looks at him and he says,
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.200]   "Yet my Father is going to pursue you.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.280]   I'm going to learn what it is that he's thinking, and then I'm going to tell you.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.620]   You can trust that I'm going to tell you, so much so that I'm willing to subject myself
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:46.600]   to God's judgment and the consequences thereof if I do not remain faithful to my oath.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.860]   That's how trustworthy you can count me."
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:52.480]   Because a true friend is trustworthy.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.720]   And we all need friends like this.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:57.160]   Like we need someone that we can open up to about the worst things happening in our life.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.600]   At the very beginning of that chapter, you see David is in a panic and he's just telling
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.200]   Jonathan, "Man, things are horrible.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:08.040]   Like your dad is seeking to take my life."
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:15.520]   And Jonathan is such a trusted place of confidence that he can receive all that David says.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:25.120]   He can help him to process it in truth, and then he can send him out to engage it wisely.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.120]   Do you have a friend like that?
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.440]   Someone that's trustworthy?
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.440]   We all need one.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:35.200]   Like we need a friend that can hear the very worst parts of ourselves, that we can process
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:39.960]   with honestly, that we can wrestle with the difficulties of life alongside.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.160]   I have a friend like this in Houston, Texas.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.360]   Like when I first went away to Houston, I was dealing with a bunch of circumstantial
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.600]   trouble.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:50.480]   Things at my job were hard, things in my marriage were difficult, and I was wrestling for probably
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.040]   the first time in my life with some depression.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:56.200]   And I was like, "Man, I just need to be able to process this stuff in a safe place."
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:01.080]   And so I grabbed a friend that I could begin to share these things with in an undivisive
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.440]   way.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:07.200]   And as I began to process with him, what I found is he was deeply safe, but he was also
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.240]   honest.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.320]   He would speak to me the things that I needed to know, and then he would help me to correct
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.680]   course and resume well.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:15.680]   You need a friend like that.
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.000]   You need someone that's trustworthy.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.920]   And when you find them, you don't let them go.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.280]   Like I've made my way here to Dallas.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.280]   He's still in Houston.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.160]   And we talk every single Friday.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:28.320]   We hop on the phone and we continue to process together because he's someone safe that I
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.200]   can confide in.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:34.040]   Proverbs 13 20 tells us, "Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise."
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.640]   So be careful who you pick.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:39.280]   But the companion of fools will suffer harm.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:45.960]   Like you want to pick people that when you deposit confidential information, something
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:52.560]   that is needed for their safekeeping, they don't turn around and tell it to others.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:57.160]   You want to be able to open up to someone and then them not open it up to everybody
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.160]   else.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.160]   That's not what you want.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:03.600]   I don't want to tell you my news and then that becomes your news to share.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.120]   That's not a good friend.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.960]   That's not what you're supposed to do.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.760]   Now let me be very clear.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:12.760]   This is not a license to gossip against other people.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.040]   And it's not a license to grumble against God either.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:21.880]   A lot of Christians in the spirit of processing will sit behind closed doors and talk about
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.640]   other people and complain behind their backs.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.280]   That is not what we're talking about right here.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:34.880]   What we're talking about is creating an environment where you can, as Job described, offer words
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:41.440]   for the wind, receive proper correction, and then move forward in godliness.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.800]   That's what you want.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:48.480]   Proverbs 12, 26 says, "One who is righteous is a guide to his neighbor, but the way of
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.880]   the wicked leads them astray."
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.880]   We don't want to lead others astray.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.760]   So we need to carefully consider what we're sharing with our friends.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.360]   So here's a way that I do it.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.180]   How do I consider what it is that I'm sharing with people in my life?
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:08.440]   If you just want a really helpful filter to follow, I consider, is it true?
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.120]   If it is, then is it kind?
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.440]   And if it is, is it necessary?
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:21.040]   If whatever it is I or you need to share, if it fails one of those tests, do not share
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.500]   it.
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:28.800]   We want to speak things that are true and kind and necessary.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:33.240]   Proverbs 11, 13 says, "Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets, but he who is
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.560]   trustworthy in spirit keeps things covered."
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:41.620]   Can you keep things covered, or are you always talking about other people?
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:46.040]   Number four, and lastly, a true friend is self-sacrificing.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.160]   A true friend is self-sacrificing.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.800]   First Samuel, chapter 23, we read this.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.560]   "David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life."
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.560]   Are you catching the pattern?
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.600]   David was in the wilderness of Ziph and Horash, and Jonathan, Saul's son, rose and he went
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.440]   to David at Horash, and he strengthened his hand in God.
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:12.380]   And he said to him, "Do not fear, for the hand of Saul, my father, shall not find you.
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:16.960]   You shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.680]   Saul my father knows all of this."
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.000]   This is the last interaction that we have recorded between Jonathan and David.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.820]   The next time we see Jonathan, he's slain on the battlefield, and David grieves the
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.960]   loss of his friend.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:36.560]   What's so interesting about this is this is the first open acknowledgement, not personal
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.240]   acknowledgement, but the first open acknowledgement of Jonathan that his rightful claim to the
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.000]   throne of his father is not fact his own.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.800]   Instead, it belongs to that of his friend.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:52.840]   This isn't a friend that's jealous of his pal, like he's not envious that he's getting
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:56.360]   ahead, he's not trying to hold him back so he can snake by.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.420]   This is not the nature of a self-sacrificing friend.
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:04.460]   Instead, it's one that not only acknowledges what's happening, but endorses it.
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:09.300]   He's like, "Man, you're the rightful king, and so I'm going to do whatever I can to make
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:16.120]   way for you to sit where God wants you to sit."
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.060]   It was his throne.
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:23.060]   He was set up to sit on it, to take over for his father.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:30.100]   And yet he so loves God, and he so loves his friend, and he so trusts the plans of redemption
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.780]   that he says, "Ah, man, I'm just a part of what God's doing in the world.
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:37.940]   And so I'll get out of the way if you sitting there means this thing moves forward."
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:42.500]   And so some of you Christians in the room, you have harbored bitterness and jealousy
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:47.140]   and comparison and even hate towards your Christian brothers and sisters because God
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.140]   has for whatever reason put them on the throne.
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:55.420]   Listen, your future and their future is not your own.
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:57.980]   It's no longer you who lives, it's Christ who lives in you.
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.100]   And he gets to do whatever the heck he wants to do.
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:05.380]   Jonathan gets it, and it makes him self-sacrificing.
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.380]   Are you self-sacrificing?
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:12.820]   Recently, I was listening to a podcast where a Navy SEAL was recounting a story of a young
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:14.940]   SEAL that served within his operation.
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:19.580]   It was a young man by the name of Michael Monsoor.
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:24.300]   Michael was posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in 2008, and this was said
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.140]   at his ceremony.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:35.460]   On St. Michael's Day, September 29th, 2006, Michael Monsoor would make the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:41.260]   Mike and two teammates, they had taken position on the outcropping of a rooftop when an insurgent
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:45.540]   grenade bounced off of Mike's chest and it landed on the roof.
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:50.780]   Mike had a clear chance to escape, but he realized that the other two SEALs, his friends,
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.460]   did not.
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:44:01.180]   In that terrible moment, he had two options, to save himself or to save his friends.
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.260]   For Mike, this was no choice at all.
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:10.100]   He threw himself onto the grenade, and he absorbed the blast with his body.
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:19.380]   One of the survivors said it this way, "Mikey looked death in the face that day and said,
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.980]   'You cannot take my brothers.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:26.260]   I will go in their stead.'"
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:32.580]   This is what true friendship looks like, and the reason we know it is because John 15,
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:40.060]   13 tells us that greater love has no one than this, that someone would lay down their life.
[00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:50.860]   Jesus Christ is the epitome, the standard, the model of true friendship, in that he has
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:55.140]   sacrificed himself for you and for me.
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.580]   Jesus knows why friendship matters.
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:03.820]   Like all of us were enemies of God at one time, and yet Jesus, the true love of God
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:08.780]   extended to us in friendship, moved towards those that did not deserve his friendship
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:10.400]   at all.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:16.420]   He moved towards not people that he found compatibility with, but people that he found
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:20.860]   enmity with, and yet he said, "I love you still anyway.
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.660]   I have ah of ah.
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:31.660]   I have an invisible affection that leads to a visible action, an action that tells us
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:37.660]   how friendship is built, that friendship with God is built by the life, death, and resurrection
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:43.900]   of Christ, that Jesus, he looked upon you knowing full well you can't do it.
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:49.980]   It's not possible for you to be perfect, to fulfill the commandment, to uphold the law.
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:54.220]   You cannot become what God intended for you to become.
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:59.220]   All have sinned and fallen short of his glory, and the wages of that sin is death.
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:03.420]   But you know what?
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:05.500]   I can do it.
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.700]   I can do what all humanity cannot.
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:13.620]   I can be perfect in your place.
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:18.820]   But I will not only build your friendship with God through my perfection and lifelong
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:29.580]   and I will also build your friendship by laying my life aside and dying the death you deserve.
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:36.140]   And so badly do I want for your friendship to my father that not only will I lay my life
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:38.860]   down, but I will take my life up again.
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:46.020]   And I will ascend to the father and rise from the grave that any who look to me and say,
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:54.540]   "That's my Lord, that's my King, that's my friend," might rise with me as well.
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:59.980]   And the beauty of the gospel is it tells us as we look upon the life of Jesus what friendship
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.660]   does look like.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:09.220]   For by befriending us, he has shown us how we ought to befriend each other.
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.980]   Do you know Jesus?
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.560]   There is no friend like he.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.460]   Do you have friends?
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:20.820]   Do you look like him?
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:26.220]   He has given you a path to eternal joy.
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:31.780]   It's found in the one that sits above you and remarkably, it's found in the ones that
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:35.500]   sit beside you.
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.020]   Let me pray for us.
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.900]   Father, we love you.
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.900]   So grateful, God, for this time, this chance to sit under your word.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.780]   God, I pray for my friends.
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:48.580]   There's some here tonight, God, that do not know you, that cannot experience true friendship
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:53.200]   with their peers until they embrace true friendship from Jesus.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.340]   There are others, God, here that are looking for a friend.
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.420]   They feel like, "Man, I've lost my friends.
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:01.420]   I can't find my friends.
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:03.540]   I've tried, but I don't know what to do next."
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:06.540]   And what those friends, God, need to do is they need to join a church.
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:08.100]   They need to get involved here.
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:11.500]   They may even need to serve with us on Tuesdays.
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:15.820]   And God, there are some people here that need to repent because they've just been a bad
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:16.820]   friend.
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:21.900]   I pray, Jesus, that as we look to your example, we might find an example to follow.
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:23.900]   It is in Christ's name we pray.
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:24.660]   Amen.
[00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:27.000]   (whooshing)
