[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.020]   [Music]
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.020]   All right, welcome friends in the room.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.020]   Everybody tuning in online.
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.020]   Get excited.
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.020]   We are continuing this series.
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.020]   There he said looking at shocking statements that Jesus
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.020]   said.
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.000]   Let me read the passage we are going to be in tonight where
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Jesus said astounding things about prayer and asking and
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   talking to God.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   This comes from Matthew 7.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Starting in verse 7, Jesus is in the middle of sermon on the
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.020]   mount, one of the greatest if not the greatest sermon of all
[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.020]   time.
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.020]   And he's talking about prayer.
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.020]   And he says this...
[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.020]   Ask and it will be given to you.
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.040]   Seek and you will find.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.040]   Knock and the door will be opened to you.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.040]   For everyone who asks receives.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.040]   Everyone who seeks finds.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.040]   And the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.040]   Which of you if your son asked for bread would give him a stone?
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.060]   Or if you asked for a fish, would give him a snake?
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.020]   If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.020]   gifts to your children, how much more will your father in heaven
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.040]   give good gifts to those who ask him?
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.040]   Ask and you shall receive.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.040]   Ask and it will be given to you.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.040]   What is Jesus saying?
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.040]   It kind of reminds me of a season in life.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.040]   Anybody engaged in the room in here?
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.040]   Sore subject.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.040]   Okay.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.040]   Nobody elbow.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.060]   And please do not let that cause conflict later tonight.
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.060]   Just blame it on me.
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.060]   He said it cannot cause conflict.
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.060]   Those of you that are engaged, you are in a season where you
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.060]   get to experience what I think is one of the best parts if not
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.060]   the best part of being engaged which is called the wedding
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.060]   registry.
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.060]   What is the wedding registry?
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.080]   Well, this is whenever you and that special someone, that
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.080]   special person get together and because you did the incredible
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.080]   thing of deciding to get married together, you now put a list of
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.100]   every gift that you would like someone else to buy you together
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.100]   and then send it out to your friends.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.100]   It's pretty astounding.
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.100]   Because it's the only time in life where you can send a list
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.100]   of specified gifts.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.100]   Hey, look, you don't have to give me anything but if you do, I
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.100]   would like it to be one of these.
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.100]   And you have not come across as entitled and like a brat that
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.100]   you are giving specific, here are the things we would like for
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.100]   you.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.100]   We want a gift from you.
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.100]   And we have already picked out the gift we want to get from
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.100]   you.
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.100]   It's amazing.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.100]   It's incredible.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.120]   And if that wasn't good enough, at some point along the way, they
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.120]   added an element I think to make it better for the grooms who had
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.120]   to go through Bed Bath & Beyond and Crate & Barrel and wherever
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120]   else one goes.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120]   And it's this.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.120]   It's a laser gun.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.120]   So you go in and they hand you a laser gun.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.120]   You don't sit down and write a list and check it twice.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.120]   They give you a laser gun and you go around the store playing
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.140]   duck hunt, shooting whatever you and your fiance would like to be
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.140]   a part of, you know, the gifts that people give you.
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.140]   It sounds similar.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.140]   And the reason I bring that up, it's this idea of like, hey, ask
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.140]   put together the list of everything that you would like to
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.140]   receive.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.140]   Bring your asks together.
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.140]   Let me give you a couple in case you are engaged.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.140]   This is just for free while we're on the subject.
[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.140]   Haven't done this in a while.
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.160]   Here's the things if you are engaged to take off of your list.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   Okay.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.160]   Number one, find China.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160]   You do not need -- the queen of England is not coming to your
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.160]   house any time soon.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160]   Nobody needs teacups and all that.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.160]   Find China.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160]   Another one that you do not need and I'm going to give you the
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160]   best ones that you need is a juicer.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160]   For whatever reason, fiancees come in and they're like, we need
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.160]   a juicer.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.180]   You will not in marriage need a juicer.
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.180]   It's going to sit in that shelf and take up the very limited
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.180]   real estate that you have in that one-bedroom apartment.
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.180]   Okay.
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.180]   Another one, you don't need a popcorn maker.
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.180]   They got microwaves, bro.
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.180]   You don't need an ice cream maker.
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.180]   These are things you're going to be tempted to register for and
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.200]   you will never, ever use them.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   They will look back and they will just be relics.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.200]   A waffle maker.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   You don't need a waffle maker.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   You're going to make waffles -- okay.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   You're going to do it.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.200]   You're going to do it one time.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.200]   You're going to put the chocolate chips in there.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   It's going to get mess everywhere.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.220]   It's not going to look like any restaurant you have been to and
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.220]   you will put it up and never use it again.
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.220]   There are a few things, again for free and don't get in the
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.220]   message.
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.220]   If you are engaged, the list of things you should ask for should
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.220]   include some good towels.
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.220]   Okay.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.220]   I don't know why I'm talking about this.
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.220]   But you're going to have those towels for years and years.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.220]   People pick out some high quality.
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.220]   Number two, high thread count bed sheets.
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.240]   You spend a third of your life and you're going to be in that
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.240]   bed with her or with him.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.240]   You want to make sure that you're sleeping on something
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.240]   comfortable.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.240]   And number three, this is most important.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.240]   Especially men, if you're engaged, you got to hear me on
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.240]   this.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.240]   A robotic vacuum.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.240]   Okay.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.240]   We are living in the Jetson age now.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.240]   And you get that robot vacuum.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.240]   And here's what I have noticed about women.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.240]   They all have something in common.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.260]   They love clean floors.
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260]   I have never met one that doesn't love clean floors.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260]   You get the robot vacuum, it's not that expensive.
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260]   You get it, you put it on your house, you set it, it cleans
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.260]   everything.
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260]   You're going to be husband of the year.
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260]   And I would like a little bit of credit.
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.260]   Okay.
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260]   So add it to your list, robot vacuum.
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260]   But whatever is on your list, you're going to be a husband of
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.260]   the year.
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.280]   And I say all of that because in a similar way, it seems like
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.280]   Jesus says that as Christians we are to put together as it were
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.280]   a wedding registry, a list of bringing all of your -- not
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.280]   wedding asks.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.280]   But all of your asks to God.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.280]   And he seems to say, and when you do so, you're going to
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.300]   receive.
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.300]   And I'm not saying that you're going to receive.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.300]   I'm saying that you're going to receive.
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.300]   And when you do so, you're going to receive.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.300]   Or is he saying that?
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.320]   Maybe better say, yeah, what are you saying, Jesus?
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.320]   We're to put together a list of things that we want and we're to
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.320]   bring them to you.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.320]   And how do we make sure that we do receive what we're asking for?
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.320]   So I want to walk through this passage as we're in the series.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.320]   And I want to sit and look at the shocking statement of Jesus.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.320]   Ask and you will receive.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.320]   Because I think there is two ways we misunderstand this
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.320]   verse.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.340]   One is we think of God as -- man, it seems like Jesus is
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.340]   saying -- he's like genie from Aladdin.
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.340]   Rub the lamp, give the wish, going to get it.
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.340]   And that's not entirely what he's saying.
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.340]   Or it's not what he's saying.
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.340]   But the other way we often think of in prayer, we write it off,
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.340]   man, of course he's not saying, ask for things and you're going
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.340]   to receive them.
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.340]   Prayer doesn't work and every time I try it, it feels like
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.360]   God is going to do what he's going to do anyways.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.360]   And I pray for 15 seconds and my mind is flooded with distractions.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.360]   I don't know where you're at in the room but as it relates to
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.360]   prayer, I want to talk and break down what exactly Jesus is
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.360]   saying.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.360]   Look at two ideas behind this idea.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.360]   There he said it, ask and you shall receive.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.360]   Two ideas from Matthew 7.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.360]   I'm going to read and break down the verses again and we'll walk
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.360]   through it.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.360]   Jesus says...
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.360]   Now look at verse 8.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.360]   So he just said ask and you'll be given, seek and you'll find,
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.360]   knock and the door will be opened.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.360]   Now for everyone who asks, receive and the one who seeks,
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   finds and the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.360]   He just said the exact same thing twice.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.360]   And not only that, he essentially says the same thing
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.360]   three times twice.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   In other words, even the Greek word for ask and seek and knock
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.360]   are really not that different.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.360]   But the first idea that Jesus is pointing out and hitting home is
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   that you and I have been invited into a relationship where you
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.360]   continually are bringing, God these are the things that I am
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.360]   fearing and facing and the things that I feel right now.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   These are the wants that I have.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.360]   And that you and I, if you are a follower of Jesus, have been
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.360]   invited into a relationship where whatever I am facing, I'm
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.360]   to talk to God about it.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.360]   Talk to God about it.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.360]   And so Jesus as it relates to ask and you'll receive, the
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.360]   first thing he's hammering home is you are to be praying
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.360]   continually.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.360]   You know what's interesting?
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.360]   All throughout the New Testament, Jesus has a running
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.360]   theme of teaching this idea.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.360]   Where on multiple occasions he tells stories and parables in
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.360]   Luke 12 and Luke 18 right here where he's saying, go to God.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.360]   Go to God.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.360]   And in Luke 18 it says this...
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:10:03.360]   If that wasn't enough, even think of the English translation
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.360]   of ask, seek, knock.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.360]   What is that spell?
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.360]   Ask.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.360]   As though he could not be any more clear.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.360]   Bring those requests to God.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.360]   Which is really important.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.360]   Because often times in life, for most Christians and
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.360]   conversations I have with things they are afraid of, job
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.360]   interview coming up.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.360]   Worried about a sickness in themselves or their family or
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.360]   something in their life.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.360]   And I will ask, have you prayed about that?
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.360]   No, I haven't prayed about it.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.360]   And when you think about it, it makes sense.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.360]   Why Jesus would say, God wants a relationship where you are
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.360]   continually communicating.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.360]   Where you are constantly in conversation with him.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.360]   That he is saying, ask, go to God.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.360]   Get your ask in gear and go to him and communicate.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.360]   All right, send me the email.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.360]   I mean that as though you ask and ask and ask.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.360]   And he's further saying that God's door is always open.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.360]   Unlike today where when somebody knocks at the door, there is
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.360]   like a suspicion and it's kind of bizarre.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.360]   For whatever reason in the last 20 years this changed.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.360]   When I was growing up as a kid, people would knock on the door
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.360]   and you run to the door.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   You are so excited.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.360]   It could be Girl Scout cookies or neighborhood kid wanting to
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.360]   play kickball.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.360]   And everybody freaks out.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:35.360]   It's like -- why does DoorDash not just leave the food there.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.360]   I don't need to hand off.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.360]   Just leave.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.360]   Even from the other side, you are looking through that peep hole
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.360]   in your apartment and I think he will leave it and go away if we
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.360]   wait long enough.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.360]   We have a closed door policy and Jesus says God's door is always
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.360]   open.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.360]   He's always there.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.360]   And this is a context, really important context.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.360]   When Jesus gives this sermon, he's trying to paint a picture to
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:08.360]   an audience that had some understanding of God.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.360]   But saw him as some distant force.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.360]   Someone that priests in the temple, which was very nearby
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.360]   when Jesus spoke this.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.360]   Where priests could go and talk to God and have a relationship
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.360]   and be near to God.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:27.360]   And Jesus says, no, you have been invited into a relationship
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.360]   where you see God as father.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.360]   And where you understand he sees you as a child.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.360]   His audience is having every category blown.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.360]   I can talk to God?
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.360]   And not just that, like God hears me?
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:49.360]   Over and over throughout even Matthew 6 when he teaches the
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.360]   church, and he's right there, right before this how to pray.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.360]   And he says, here's how you should talk to God.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.360]   Father in heaven.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.360]   Heavenly dad.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.360]   Holy is your name.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.360]   You are amazing.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.360]   You are incredible.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.360]   Would you give me today's needs.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.360]   When we even think about that, for whatever reason our brain
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.360]   translates it into old English and we don't hear what his
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.360]   audience is saying.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.360]   Our father in heaven, Hallowood be your name.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.360]   And King James version, his audience heard something very
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.360]   different.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.360]   Jesus saying, no, no, that's like a father.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.360]   And he wants a relationship like a father with you.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.360]   I know there is parts of my heart and my life and I think all
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.360]   of ours, that's so difficult for me to comprehend.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.360]   Because think about the type of relationship a child has with
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.360]   somebody.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.360]   Or a neighbor's kid has with somebody.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.360]   Remember when you were a kid and thirsty and Mrs.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.360]   Johnson, would you mind if I had a cup of water.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.360]   When it was your house, it didn't look like that at all.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:06.360]   Hey, yo mom, we ain't got Capri Sun, can somebody go to Kroger
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.360]   and get Capri Sun, because we are playing video games.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.360]   It was astounding.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:18.360]   And the Bible hammers home, not in an irreverent way but you are
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.360]   my father in heaven.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.360]   And that's the type of relationship he's invited you and
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.360]   I into.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.360]   And some of you when you pray, God is saying ask, continually
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.360]   ask.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.360]   Bring those asks to me.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.360]   It's hard for you to compute that.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.360]   Because you talk to God different than you talk to
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.360]   people.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.360]   And maybe it was because of the way you were raised or modeled
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.360]   and heard priests pray.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.360]   But when you do pray, you down shift into King James version
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.360]   like you are reading the declaration of independence or
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.360]   something.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.360]   And not just God, man, I'm really anxious right now.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.360]   I don't know if I'm going to get the job.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.360]   And I feel like I'm just overwhelmed and honestly I'm still
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.360]   thinking about the last conversation that I had with
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.360]   my coworker and what they think about me.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.360]   You don't feel like you can have that type of honest dialogue.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.360]   And maybe the best take away for some of us in the room is pray
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.360]   honest prayers.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.360]   It's not like he doesn't know already.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.360]   It's not like you didn't understand and see what you are
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.360]   feeling.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.360]   I was talking to a friend not long ago and I'm telling you, I
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.360]   think this is so pervasive in how we think.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.360]   Where we try to reverse psychology on God.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.360]   And I was talking to a friend, a girl serving here for years,
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.360]   amazing godly girl and single.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.360]   And I'm struggling with singleness and I asked have you
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.360]   prayed about that?
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.360]   What does that look like?
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.360]   She said, no, I feel like honestly I can't talk to God about
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.360]   that.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.360]   Because if I say I'm struggling with singleness, he's going to
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.360]   make me continue to be single until I'm okay with not being
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.360]   single.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.360]   And I can't tell God that because if I tell God that, he's
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.360]   going to continue to make me single until I'm happy being
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.360]   single.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.360]   You're crazy.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.360]   It could be inside of all of our heads.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.360]   We're like man, I can't -- you know, part of us just thinks, oh
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.360]   no, he doesn't really know.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.360]   He knows all of it.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.360]   And Jesus says he's invited you into a relationship where you
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.360]   call him father.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.360]   What do I pray for?
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.360]   As it relates to go to ask and ask.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.360]   It's very important.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.360]   Anything you care about, you should talk to God about it.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:48.360]   First Peter 5 verse 7 says cast all of your cares on God because
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.360]   he cares for you.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.360]   What do you think he means by cast?
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.360]   Like throw it out in the water?
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.360]   No, clearly he's saying bring all of those things to God.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.360]   It's really beautiful, powerful verse.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.360]   Cast everything you care about to God.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.360]   Bring all of what you care about to God because you are what God
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.360]   cares about.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.360]   Pretty profound.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.360]   That anything that you're anxious about, anything you're
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.360]   feeling, any of those desires, man, I'm going to bring all of
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.360]   those to God.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.360]   God, I want to have a spouse.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   Doesn't mean you're guaranteed you're going to get a spouse.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   But it doesn't make you spiritual for pretending you don't want
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.360]   that.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.360]   It makes you inauthentic.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.360]   And he's invited you in a relationship where you see him
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.360]   as father and bring those requests to me.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.360]   Is he saying, this is important, that everything you ask for, you
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.360]   will get it.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.360]   No.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.360]   Thank God you were not saying that.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.360]   Or else so many of us would be married to Stephanie from second
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.360]   grade right now.
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:57.360]   Or we would be like an astronaut or some other job that you are
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.360]   like this is all I want to be in life.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.360]   No, he's not saying that.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.360]   You will get an answer.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:09.360]   And the answer will either be yes, no, or not now.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.360]   The answer will be yes, no, or not now.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.360]   When does God -- when is it an automatic yes?
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.360]   The Bible seems to say there's occasions where it's an
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.360]   automatic yes.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:27.360]   And those occasions are where God's will for your life and
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.360]   God's desires align with our requests.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:36.360]   Jesus says over and over again this idea that anything you ask
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:42.360]   in my name or according to my will, ask it and I will do it.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:49.360]   John 14...
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:57.360]   John 15...
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:04.360]   And John 16 and 17...
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.360]   Does that mean we say, hey, Lord, I would like a Lamborghini
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.360]   in your name.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.360]   Boom.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.360]   No, that would be amazing.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:18.360]   But no, it means whenever God's will, revealed will and sovereign
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.360]   will, when it intersects.
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.360]   Those are the times we understand it happens.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.360]   But nevertheless he's invited us to a relationship where you
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.360]   bring those things constantly to him.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.360]   If you are in a dating relationship right now, you know
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.360]   the things that weigh you the most down.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.360]   Like your mom is sick or you are out of a job.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.360]   Do you know the person you are dating about that one time?
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.360]   No.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.360]   You are not like, oh, man, my mom is sick.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.360]   Okay, good.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.360]   We talked about it.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.360]   We can move on.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.360]   You bring it.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.360]   It's constantly there.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.360]   And he's invited us into a relationship where you can ask
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.360]   and trust him.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.360]   Then he goes into and answers I think a really important
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:06.360]   question that a lot of us are wondering whether we would put
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:12.360]   it in this way as it relates to -- when I ask and I don't get
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.360]   what I ask for.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.360]   And I do get something I didn't ask for.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.360]   Is that because God is a bad gift giver?
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.360]   Like remember that registry, when my wife and I registered
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.360]   for ours, we registered and filled it out.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.360]   And inevitably this is going to happen if you are engaged, get
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.360]   ready for it.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.360]   I am telling you your future right now.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.360]   Somebody will do what is called, I went off the registry.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.360]   And they will buy a gift that you didn't ask for but they
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.360]   thought, you know what, I'm going to give them this.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.360]   Which is always a gamble.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.360]   And oftentimes it's just because the person is just not very good
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.360]   at giving gifts.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.360]   For example, with us, somebody gave us this gift and it was a
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.360]   nativity set.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.360]   Which is awesome.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.360]   But it had Mary and Joseph and Jesus.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.360]   Each of them were a foot and a half tall.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.360]   It was like a statue.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.360]   I was like, oh, man, this is great.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.360]   And the worst part was, they were a well-off family.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.360]   I am like, dude, I know this is like a $500 set that we can't
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.360]   sell on eBay or do anything that is sitting on our attic right
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.360]   now.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.360]   And we didn't ask for it, they just went off the registry.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.360]   And I am thankful.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.360]   I thought it was great.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.360]   It's my wife, she doesn't like it if you listen to this.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.360]   It was just a reflection of, oh, man, why did you not just stick
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.360]   with the registry.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.360]   The times when we get something we didn't ask for.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.360]   Because God is -- is he just not great at giving gifts?
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.360]   And Jesus answers that in a really important way.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:54.360]   As crude or comical as I am being about it.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.360]   Here's what he says...
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.360]   Which of you if your son asked for bread would give him a
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.360]   stone?
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.360]   Jesus is talking.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.360]   I'm going to talk to all the dads in the room.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.360]   If you had a son come up and say, dad, can I have some bread.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.360]   Would you give him a stone?
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.360]   Or if he asked for a fish, would you give him a snake?
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.360]   If you then, though you were evil, know how to give good
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.360]   gifts to your children.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.360]   And by evil he means in comparison to God.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:31.360]   The best and worst earthly father in comparison to God is
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.360]   evil.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.360]   Compared to a perfect, loving, holy God.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:42.360]   He says even the worst dad is not going to do that.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:49.360]   How much more will your father in heaven give good gifts to
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.360]   those who ask him.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.360]   And then he brings up bread and fish.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.360]   Bread and fish was an incredibly common meal in that day.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:03.360]   You read the New Testament and see multiple occasions where
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.360]   fish and loaves or ate fish and had bread with it.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.360]   Very common, not fancy or hors d'oeuvres or filet mignon.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:17.360]   And the son comes up and says, dad, can I have some bread or
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.360]   fish.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:23.360]   I just need to eat in order to live.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:28.360]   And Jesus is saying, just like in that scenario where a child
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.360]   is saying, this is the bare need that I have.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.360]   I'm bringing it to you, dad.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:38.360]   There is no dad out there, even the worst dad wouldn't be like,
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.360]   you want some bread.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.360]   Here's a rock.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.360]   Here's a fish.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.360]   Here's a snake.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.360]   Nobody would do that.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.360]   It's crazy, comical.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.360]   I love these jokes.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:55.360]   And he's going, even the worst dad out there would not do that.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.360]   And you by comparison are evil.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.360]   Do you think God would do that?
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.360]   He says, no, God only gives good things.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.360]   He doesn't give all things.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.360]   He only gives good things.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.360]   The second idea I want to talk about this idea of ask and
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.360]   receive.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.360]   It involves continually praying continually.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.360]   That's the first idea.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.360]   And the second one is equally as important.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.360]   And that is trust constantly.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.360]   As it relates to living the Christian life, there is a faith
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.360]   that is involved to walk through and hold on to the fact of the
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.360]   teachings of Jesus, which is he only gives good things.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:42.360]   Which means if I experience a not good thing, it's either not
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.360]   from God and it's a part of living in a broken world.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:52.360]   Or it is something that though I cannot see it right now, will be
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.360]   good.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.360]   Because God's not done.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.360]   It is either not from God or it is something that one day I will
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:05.360]   see how despite the ways and times and feelings, why would
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.360]   this happen?
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.360]   I will see it and see that it was good.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.360]   Because God, he only gives good things.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.360]   And if he goes off the registry of my asks and he gives me
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.360]   something I didn't ask for or he doesn't give me something I ask
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.360]   for.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.360]   It's not because he doesn't love me.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.360]   He proved that by dying on the cross and coming and dying for
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.360]   everything you have done.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.360]   And he doesn't care about you if he doesn't give you what you
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.360]   want.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.360]   And it's not because he can't.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.360]   All powerful, created everything, he can do anything.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.360]   The reason why is because he knows something that I don't.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.360]   So if I ask for something and I don't get it, it's not because
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.360]   he doesn't care and not because he can't.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.360]   It's because he knows something that I don't.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.360]   It's like this, my daughter is three and she's probably the
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.360]   most beautiful kid in the world.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.360]   And I'm totally kidding.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:08.360]   But what is not kidding, she would eat Cheetos and Pringles
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.360]   for every meal.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.360]   Amen.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.360]   Thank you.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.360]   You are a people.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.360]   We're going to eat vegetables and try a piece of fruit.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.360]   Anything other than Cheetos and Pringles.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.360]   And she doesn't understand.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.360]   She will throw fits and say I want Pringles.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.360]   Give me the Pringles.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:33.360]   And you are about to get a spanking and she will starve
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.360]   herself until you give me the Pringles.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.360]   She can't comprehend that you can't eat Pringles and Cheetos
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.360]   for every meal.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.360]   And the fact that you are angry at your parents because we won't
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.360]   allow you to do that.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.360]   Because we understand something you don't, that's not a healthy
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.360]   nutritious diet.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.360]   You will be malnourished and at three you can't comprehend that.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.360]   But there's something you don't understand.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.360]   And I'm not giving you Pringles not because I don't love you and
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.360]   not because I don't have them.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.360]   Because I know something you don't know.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.360]   I understand something you don't.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:15.360]   And could it be possible that in a very similar way, if a three-year-old
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.360]   to a 30-something-year-old, there's a breakdown in understanding
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:25.360]   that an infinite, holy, perfect, all-knowing, all-wise God could
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.360]   look at us when there's something we're saying, I want the Pringles
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.360]   of blank.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:36.360]   And he says, it's not because I don't care about you.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.360]   It's not that I couldn't give it to you.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.360]   It's I know something you don't.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.360]   And you can trust me.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:49.360]   I've shown I'm a God who will care for you and provide for you to the
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.360]   farthest length, even dying on a cross.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:28:01.360]   I know in this room there are some times where life, and because it's
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:09.360]   a broken sin world, it feels like it just handed you a snake and a stone.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:16.360]   And there are times where represented here, I know in this room right
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.360]   now, and listening at 14 different locations, you're walking through
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.360]   something and it feels like a snake and a stone.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.360]   And some of it is because it's not from God.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.360]   He didn't want it.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.360]   He didn't create it.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:33.360]   He didn't cause it.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:36.360]   He may have allowed it.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.360]   And the challenge emotionally is when you're walking through a chronic
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.360]   illness, when you're walking through a breakup, when you're walking
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.360]   through the loss of a parent, it doesn't matter if he caused it or if
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.360]   he allowed it.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.360]   I'm still walking through pain.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:56.360]   And it's hard to understand how that's not a stone or a snake.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:01.360]   And the Bible tells us that God has promised everything good comes from
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.360]   one place.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.360]   That's him.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:11.360]   And for Christians, everything not good will be made good in eternity.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.360]   That one day we will see it from a different lens and understand how
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.360]   right and all the brokenness and all the pain and all the suffering that
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:22.360]   he was working and bringing about good through it in ways that I'll never
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.360]   be able to understand and candidly I wouldn't even try or I would fail
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:29.360]   miserably to try to articulate in your particular situation with all the
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.360]   pain that you've walked through.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.360]   How is God going to bring good about through that?
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.360]   This week is like I mentioned earlier, it's JD's birthday, which is
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.360]   awesome, so fun.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.360]   It's also the anniversary of his dad dying in his early 40s of pancreatic
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.360]   cancer.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:49.360]   Do you know how rare that is?
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:58.360]   How do you tell me that's anything but a stone or a snake?
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.360]   And while I don't know all the ways God will bring about good through
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:07.360]   that, through your pain, I know that he has promised one day every tear
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.360]   will be wiped and I will make everything beautiful in its time.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:18.360]   Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 11 says, he has made as in it's done, it
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:24.360]   will be done, everything beautiful in its time, that God will redeem
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.360]   everything that he allows.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:37.360]   Every chronic illness that many friends in this room have that you
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.360]   plead with God to take away.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.360]   I can't even understand how he would use that or abuse, how he's going to
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.360]   take horrific things and weave them together for good.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.360]   But he's promised that he will.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:54.360]   In Romans chapter 8 verse 28 it says a very common verse, we know that in
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:58.360]   everything, all things, God works together for the good of those who
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.360]   love him.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.360]   Who have been called according to his purpose.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:06.360]   I don't know what you're walking through but I know in this life or in
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.360]   the one to come you will see and I will see even the worst of things
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.360]   woven together for good.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.360]   Maybe you're walking through a breakup.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:19.360]   I remember one of the most terrible times of my life was a breakup that I
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.360]   had with my wife.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.360]   We broke up and spent two years apart.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:26.360]   And I was in that stage and you know it, breakups, they're not the end of
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:30.360]   the world but the end of something that was a huge part of your world.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:36.360]   And it feels like oh, man, just ripped the heart out of my chest and put on
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:41.360]   Brian McKnight songs and Taylor Swift and wondering why God, why did this
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.360]   happen to me.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.360]   And we spent two years apart and ended up, we dated again and got married
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.360]   shortly after that.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.360]   And that two years which I never would have asked for and pales in
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:56.360]   comparison to so much of the pain represented here.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.360]   But God got a hold of my heart and deepened my faith and my knowledge of
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.360]   his word in a way that today I still pull from.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.360]   I don't know who I would have been without those two years.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.360]   And I look back and it was so painful and yet I'm so thankful.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   And I pretend to transfer that onto horrific pain that is represented here.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:20.360]   Just saying like that and dozens or hundreds of other ways in my own life
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:25.360]   and lives of other people I've seen, I've seen God bring about good through
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:29.360]   tragedy, through pain, through heartache.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:34.360]   Sometimes we can see it and someday we will see it.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.360]   And we see it from above.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.360]   I remember this, I was invited to a football game.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:44.360]   Somebody had tickets and I got to go down and sit on the ground floor or
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.360]   sit on the floor.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:50.360]   And I was walking around and seeing the game and halftime, it was college
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.360]   football.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.360]   And marching bands come out on the field and do the marching thing.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:00.360]   And if you have sat on the front row or on the field level, seeing the game
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.360]   and seeing the marching band is a totally different perspective.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.360]   You can't quite see all that you can see if you sit in another location.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:11.360]   So I'm watching the marching band and I see these guys come out and you have
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:16.360]   the tubas and trombones and clarinets and trumpets and all these different
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.360]   instruments and walking and going and it looks like they are walking right at
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.360]   each other.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:24.360]   And you are like, oh, man, the tuba is about to take out that trombone and
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:28.360]   take a turn and make the sharpest turns and going all these angles.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.360]   And you have drummers going everywhere.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.360]   It looks chaotic.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.360]   What is going on?
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.360]   It's like somebody kicked an amp pile of band kids on the field.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:41.360]   And it just looks chaotic.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.360]   You are seeing it like eye level.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.360]   And then you look up at the jumbotron.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:56.360]   And when you see it from above, you see there is purpose and beauty and
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.360]   order.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.360]   And it's spelling out something.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:04.360]   And everything that looks so chaotic when you looked at it on the ground
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:09.360]   level, so messed up.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:16.360]   When you see it from above, there is purpose, intentionality behind all of
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.360]   it.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:22.360]   And I wish that I could connect the dots in your life of how that's going to
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.360]   happen.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.360]   But I can't.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:28.360]   But I do know it's going to happen if you are a follower of Jesus.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:33.360]   And in the meantime, he's invited you to come and ask and know and bring
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.360]   all of those requests.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:38.360]   And if he doesn't answer the prayer the way you want it, it's not because he
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.360]   doesn't care.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.360]   It's not because he can't.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.360]   It's because he knows something that you don't.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.360]   I don't.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:49.360]   Tim Keller who is a well-known pastor put it this way, he said God will give
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:54.360]   us when we ask him, we ask to receive.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:59.360]   He will either give us what we ask or what we would have asked if we knew
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.360]   everything he does.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:06.360]   God will either give us, God, will you take this away, will you bring a spouse
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.360]   in my life, will you take the sickness away, will you help me to finish school,
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.360]   will you provide a job for me.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.360]   He will either give us those things that we ask for or what we would have asked
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.360]   for if we knew and could see everything that he sees.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:24.360]   And in the meantime he's invited us, you can ask knowing.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.360]   Your father in heaven, he only gives good things.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:32.360]   So if it's not good, it's either not done or it's not from him.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:36.360]   And he will bring about good eventually through it.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:41.360]   I said earlier, just to wrap up, that the best thing about being engaged was
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.360]   all the different presents that you get and the gifts that you receive when you
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.360]   get married.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.360]   Really that's not true.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.360]   The best thing about being married is not the fact that you're going to sit there
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:54.360]   and eventually you get married, you receive all those gifts, and you're sitting
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:58.360]   open in the toaster and for this person the waffle maker and for you whatever
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:01.360]   other things you added to your list.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.360]   That's not the best part of being married at all.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:09.360]   It's not the gifts you receive, it's the relationship you step into.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:15.360]   And you know what's funny is as awesome as all those things you ask for are
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:21.360]   and everything you get, you enter into this relationship where all of them
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:29.360]   shrink and pale in comparison to the greatest gift which is her or a wife or
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.360]   him, a husband.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:36.360]   And all the other stuff, it's nice and it's cool, but it's a joke to even put
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:44.360]   them on the same level, playing field of husband and gifts, receiving things you
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:48.360]   ask for.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:54.360]   I think there's going to come a day where all of us will see that the greatest
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:37:01.360]   gift, need, thing that we at our heart of hearts have ever wanted was none of the
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.360]   things that you've asked for, wished that God would do.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.360]   It's always been him.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.360]   It always will be him.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.360]   I believe that because you know the same passage occurs in two different places
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.360]   in the New Testament.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:19.360]   It occurs in Matthew chapter 7 and it occurs in Luke chapter 11.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.360]   Exact same verses.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.360]   Exact same words.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.360]   With two exceptions.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.360]   Luke reads through and says...
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:40.360]   And then he says the same thing.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.360]   Luke chapter 11, verse 13...
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.360]   Same exact story.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.360]   Another occasion Jesus is teaching and he says...
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:23.360]   And Luke says...
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.360]   He loves giving good things, but you know what more than anything he loves?
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:31.360]   Giving the best thing, which is him.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.360]   So much so that he would give his own life on the cross so that you would have
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   the greatest need, desire, and ask that you will ever have, which is him.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.360]   And candidly, the longer that I've just been doing this and the older that I get,
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.360]   the more that I see in life people going, as they deepen in their relationship
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:52.360]   with God, they discover all of the things that they think, "Man, if I just had that,
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.360]   I would be happy. If I just had that, man, life would be amazing."
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:01.360]   They begin to discover, you know, "I'm thankful that God has given me what he has.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:06.360]   I'm thankful that he's given me a house or family and a car, but more than anything,
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.360]   I am thankful that I have him.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.360]   More than anything that I want in God, I'm thankful for all the stuff that you've given me.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:16.360]   More than any of that, though, I want you."
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.360]   Like I mentioned with my kids, I love giving them good things.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.360]   I hope they have good things.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.360]   I hope they have good lives.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.360]   I hope they're healthy.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.360]   I hope they get married.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.360]   I hope they get to be a grandfather of their grandkids or of their kids.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:29.360]   I hope that all of life goes well.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:37.360]   But more than any of that, I hope that they know Jesus
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:41.360]   and they receive the greatest gift, the greatest need, and the greatest thing
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:46.360]   that they desire, whether or not they realize it, which is him.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.360]   And that is a gift that if you ask for tonight, God has an amazing track record.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.360]   When you begin to go, "God, you know what?
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:56.360]   I do need a car and I do need a job, but more than any of that, I want you.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.360]   I want more of you.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:04.360]   I want you and a deeper relationship with you," you will discover that is a prayer God loves to answer.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:08.360]   And if you're in the room tonight and you have never invited or asked God,
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:12.360]   "Hey, I'm asking you, Lord, for a relationship with you.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.360]   I'm inviting and I'm asking."
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:20.360]   I'm beginning to think I was made for something more than just the American dream.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:24.360]   I was made for a relationship with you, God, and so I'm asking you,
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:29.360]   will you allow me to put my faith in Christ, receive the Holy Spirit?
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.360]   I want you. I want you.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.360]   You will discover tonight the one you were made for,
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.360]   the one who died on a cross for every sin that you've ever done and ever will do,
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.360]   who came back alive, who you came into this world with every breath,
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:48.360]   desiring whether you realize it or not, and you will die and breathe your last breath,
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.360]   having been made for him.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:57.360]   And the reason you're here tonight is to receive that, because if you ask,
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:03.360]   you will receive the one you were made for, who has a name, Jesus,
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:11.360]   and God, who is willing and dying quite literally for you to know him.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.360]   Let me pray.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:18.360]   Father, I pray that you would allow any person who's never put their faith in Jesus
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:24.360]   to receive the greatest desire and ask and need that they have,
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:31.360]   which is not more stuff, it's not a different relationship status.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.360]   It's you.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:37.360]   And you would allow them to simply say, "God, I believe that.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.360]   I know I'm not on my own. It's not working. I need your help."
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.360]   And I invite you. I'm a sinner.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:48.360]   And I ask you for your help.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:52.360]   And I receive through Christ forgiveness.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.360]   Take my life.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:59.360]   God, would you bless every person in here?
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:05.360]   Would you allow them to have favorite work, incredible marriages, incredible futures?
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:10.360]   But more than anything, would you give them more of you?
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:14.360]   That they would ask that for the rest of their days and receive.
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.360]   In Christ's name, amen.
