1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
 (drum roll)

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,680
 - Howdy!

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,520
 - Howdy!

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,920
 - Good to see you guys.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,440
 If you have a Bible, I wanna read to you a couple verses

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,840
 starting in Mark chapter one.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,120
 And I wanna read 'em to you and then we'll pray

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,560
 and then we can move through 'em together.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,800
 But if you've got a Bible, Mark chapter one's

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,620
 where we're gonna be.

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,920
 If you don't, I think they're gonna put 'em on the screen

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,520
 so you'll be okay.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,680
 But while you're turning there, let me just say,

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,200
 I love this church.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,360
 When I graduated from Texas A&M,

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,800
 (audience cheers)

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,040
 I did not move to Dallas, but I had people

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,800
 that I cared about move to Dallas.

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,600
 And there were some people that I just,

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,720
 I wasn't sure what was gonna happen to 'em spiritually.

21
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,960
 And it was awesome for me to run into them months later

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,960
 and to see them just blasting off in their love of God,

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,280
 and trust of Him, and their peace, and their joy in life,

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,680
 just hitting new levels of living.

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,160
 And so much of it was because of the community

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,320
 and the love and the support they found at this place.

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,080
 And over the last several years,

28
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,760
 I've found that people I really care about come here

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,100
 and are blessed and are ministered to.

30
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,320
 So when they asked me to come this summer,

31
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,840
 I said yes, absolutely, 'cause I'm a fan of Watermark

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,160
 and all these people.

33
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,960
 So it's wonderful, wonderful to be here.

34
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,200
 Mark chapter one, beginning in verse 14.

35
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,640
 Let me read a couple verses to you, we'll pray,

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,500
 and then dive in.

37
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,320
 It says this.

38
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,120
 Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee,

39
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,720
 proclaiming the gospel of God and saying,

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,040
 "The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand.

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,520
 "Repent and believe in the gospel."

42
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,120
 And passing alongside the Sea of Galilee,

43
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,440
 he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon,

44
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,880
 casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.

45
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,160
 And Jesus said to them, "Follow me,

46
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,520
 "and I will make you become fishers of men."

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,600
 And immediately they left their nets and followed him.

48
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,680
 And going on a little farther,

49
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,240
 he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother,

50
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,280
 who were in their boat, mending the nets.

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,160
 And immediately he called to them,

52
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,960
 and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat

53
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,560
 with the hired servants and followed him.

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,840
 And they went into Capernaum,

55
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,200
 and immediately on the Sabbath,

56
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,400
 he entered the synagogue and was teaching.

57
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,840
 And they were astonished at his teaching,

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,840
 for he taught them as one who had authority,

59
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,140
 not as the scribes.

60
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,640
 And immediately there was in the synagogue

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,860
 a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,

62
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,040
 "What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth?

63
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,460
 "Have you come to destroy us?

64
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,380
 "I know who you are, the Holy One of God."

65
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,860
 But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, come out of him."

66
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,660
 And the unclean spirit convulsing him

67
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,040
 and crying out with a loud voice came out of him.

68
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,840
 And they were all amazed,

69
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,260
 so that they questioned among themselves, saying,

70
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,760
 "What is this, a new teaching with authority?

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,400
 "He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."

72
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,520
 And at once his fame spread everywhere

73
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,680
 throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee,

74
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,640
 and immediately he left the synagogue,

75
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,340
 entered the house of Simon and Andrew,

76
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,460
 with James and John.

77
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,800
 Now Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever,

78
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,200
 and immediately they told him about her.

79
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,760
 And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up,

80
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,920
 and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.

81
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,800
 And that evening at sundown, they brought to him

82
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,480
 all who were sick or oppressed by demons,

83
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,320
 and the whole city was gathered together at the door.

84
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,160
 Let me pray for us.

85
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,080
 Lord, thanks for these few minutes we have together

86
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,960
 around your word.

87
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,280
 Thanks for every person here, God,

88
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,040
 whether they came here because they just

89
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,360
 love studying the Bible,

90
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,040
 and they just couldn't wait to do that,

91
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,820
 and Sunday isn't sufficient,

92
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,720
 they need other days to connect with you,

93
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,760
 in a space like this, I just think that's awesome.

94
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,140
 And thank you for the people that are here

95
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,800
 that that's not their story at all.

96
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,360
 They're here 'cause they got tricked or something,

97
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,500
 or someone just brought 'em and they said okay,

98
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,360
 and acquiesced to being at a church on a Tuesday.

99
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,040
 Wherever we are, God, and how we connect

100
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,800
 to moments like this, and how we think about you,

101
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,360
 I just wanna thank you that you've given us

102
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
 this collective moment together

103
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,880
 to talk about you and to think about you,

104
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,140
 and to hear about what you care about.

105
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,180
 And I just wanna ask you, God, in these few minutes,

106
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,940
 would you help us see Jesus, and see him clearly?

107
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,620
 Open our eyes so that we understand what he was doing,

108
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,600
 and understand how he wanted to present himself.

109
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,820
 And then, Father, I pray we wouldn't just understand it,

110
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,820
 I pray you would help us think your thoughts,

111
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,460
 and also love what you love.

112
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,860
 Help us see him and see him as lovely.

113
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,840
 God, our hearts need to be touched by you,

114
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,500
 and I'm asking you to do that.

115
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,800
 I want some lives to be different

116
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,760
 as a result of this moment,

117
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,060
 and I just really feel it tonight,

118
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,220
 I can't generate that, I can't.

119
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,740
 Watermark, and the Shanes, and Ben

120
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,940
 are not what people in this room need, it's really not.

121
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,460
 It's you, we need you, God, together.

122
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,420
 And so please sit with us.

123
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,640
 And I wanna ask you, if you're willing,

124
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,780
 just to take a minute and pray.

125
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,460
 You talk to him, and say,

126
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,600
 God, please teach me something right now.

127
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,760
 (silence)

128
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,940
 And then if you would, please pray for me,

129
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,740
 that the Lord would use me and I would be helpful to you.

130
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:41,060
 Well, Father, we love you, and we trust you.

131
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,960
 Use this time, and we pray that in Jesus' name, amen.

132
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,020
 Well, several years ago,

133
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,020
 I was part of a ministry in Houston

134
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,340
 that used to gather periodically

135
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,100
 with other pastors from the area to pray.

136
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,660
 And I remember whenever we would do it,

137
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,660
 there was always one guy and I that were reintroduced.

138
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,420
 And I say reintroduced because I always remembered him,

139
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,500
 but he never remembered me.

140
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,480
 But he would never say that.

141
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,740
 They would always say, hey, do you remember Ben?

142
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,700
 And he would go, yeah!

143
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,660
 Right, and then to show everybody that he remembered me,

144
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,340
 he would tell a story about a shared experience we had.

145
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,740
 The only problem is the stories

146
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,500
 were never actually about me.

147
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,700
 So I remember the first time, they're like,

148
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,520
 you remember Ben?

149
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,260
 He was like, yeah, we used to play golf together.

150
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,580
 He's got a great swing.

151
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,900
 And I'm sitting there thinking,

152
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,580
 I've never played golf, like in my life.

153
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,940
 Like not just with you, but like in life.

154
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,460
 And the next time I saw him, they were like,

155
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,300
 you remember Ben?

156
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,900
 He was like, yeah, man, we shared the gospel once

157
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,880
 in the third ward in Houston, down in this bar.

158
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,380
 This guy's a powerful evangelist.

159
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,700
 He's anointed and he's going on,

160
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,340
 and I'm like, I've never been to a bar with you.

161
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,180
 And the longer this went on, I was like,

162
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,820
 I don't know who this golf-playing bar evangelist is

163
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,100
 that he's thinking of, but it's not me.

164
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,760
 And I never called him on it.

165
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,620
 I was never like, you are a liar.

166
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,620
 I just kind of went, hey, hey,

167
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,820
 and we'd visit for a minute and then move on.

168
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,360
 But the interactions were always brief.

169
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,620
 They were always shallow.

170
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,620
 Our relationship wasn't very deep.

171
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,620
 And it was certainly not one of those handful

172
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,940
 of relationships you get in life

173
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,040
 that was transformative to me as a person,

174
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,300
 because at the end of the day, he didn't know me.

175
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,120
 And so we could know each other's names,

176
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,060
 know a little bit, but it wasn't transformative.

177
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,960
 He didn't know me.

178
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,220
 Now, why tell you that?

179
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,100
 For this reason, we're talking about Jesus tonight,

180
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,640
 and everybody knows Jesus.

181
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,840
 Everybody likes Jesus.

182
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,520
 Everybody's on board with Jesus.

183
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,360
 Everyone's like, Jesus, yeah, I know Jesus.

184
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,960
 Yeah, that's great, I love him.

185
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,980
 Katy Perry's got his name tattooed on her wrist.

186
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,320
 Justin Bieber's got it on his ribs.

187
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,640
 Kesha's got Jesus on her necklace, right?

188
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,120
 Everybody's into Jesus.

189
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,880
 Every religion has a prominent place for Jesus.

190
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,480
 I remember sitting with a Satanist at the zoo,

191
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,460
 a story I don't have time to unpack.

192
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,720
 (audience laughing)

193
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,680
 But even for them, Jesus has a prominent place in Satanism.

194
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,080
 So everybody is on board with Jesus.

195
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,360
 I've never really met someone that's like,

196
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,680
 Jesus, I hate that guy.

197
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,360
 Even people that aren't into Christians,

198
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,000
 aren't into church, say they don't have a problem with Jesus.

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,560
 Everyone's like, Jesus, yeah, I know Jesus.

200
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,200
 I'm into Jesus, I like Jesus.

201
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,520
 But if you start to ask people, then tell me about him.

202
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,380
 When you ask people about what he actually did

203
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,780
 and actually said, it's amazing how few people

204
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,960
 really know what the real Jesus had to say

205
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,760
 and what he thought and what he did.

206
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,360
 And so there's people that say, yeah, I know Jesus.

207
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,200
 Yeah, I'm into Jesus.

208
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,720
 But they don't actually know much about Jesus.

209
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,520
 So they've got a picture of Jesus,

210
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,080
 but it's one that they've just kind of filled in the gaps

211
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,480
 with things they made up out of their own head.

212
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
 It's like a make-believe Jesus.

213
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,640
 And the problem with a Jesus like that is he's not real.

214
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,220
 It's like having an imaginary girlfriend

215
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,580
 or imaginary boyfriend.

216
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,400
 That's not gonna be a deep relationship.

217
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,120
 And it's not gonna be transformative.

218
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,840
 It's not gonna change you, right?

219
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,960
 'Cause at the end of the day, it's just kind of you.

220
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,080
 And so the reality is I'm just was thinking about us

221
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,800
 and praying about us and here,

222
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,600
 and I'm thinking what we need is not like a Jesus

223
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,040
 we make up, a Jesus we like,

224
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,120
 'cause it tends to be the Jesus we make up

225
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,760
 tend to agree with everything we think or believe.

226
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,100
 And that's not gonna change you.

227
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,600
 But none of us are who we're meant to be.

228
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,980
 We're not the men we're meant to be and we know it.

229
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,920
 We're not the women we're meant to be and we know it.

230
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,500
 And what we need, if we're gonna change,

231
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,680
 if we're gonna be what we were meant to be under God,

232
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,800
 what we need is not a Jesus we made up.

233
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,360
 What we need is the real Jesus.

234
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,400
 And that's why we're in Mark,

235
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,040
 'cause that's what Mark gives us.

236
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,400
 Gospel of Mark, most scholars believe,

237
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,600
 was the first one ever written about Jesus,

238
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,520
 first written account of him.

239
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,840
 And for the first decade or two after Jesus' life,

240
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
 there weren't really written accounts about him

241
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,980
 because the truth is they didn't really need one.

242
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,540
 I mean, there were so many people that knew him.

243
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,360
 First Corinthians 15 says there was like hundreds of people

244
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,160
 that connected with Jesus, knew Jesus.

245
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,220
 So in those early days, after his death and resurrection,

246
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,720
 there wasn't much written down about him

247
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,200
 because if there was any distortions about Jesus,

248
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,380
 if anyone was confused about what he was really like

249
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,240
 or began to say stuff that wasn't true,

250
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,160
 like, oh yeah, Jesus, didn't he like fly

251
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,640
 and like shoot fireballs?

252
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,800
 There was enough people that knew him

253
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,580
 that would be like, no, no, he wasn't like that.

254
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,080
 But as time went on, the people that knew Jesus personally

255
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,920
 were dying off.

256
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,360
 And so those that knew him realized,

257
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,040
 hey, we want generations later,

258
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,540
 people like us to know the real Jesus.

259
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,740
 And so guys like Mark wrote down this account of Jesus

260
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,760
 so we could know the real Jesus.

261
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
 And what we're looking at tonight

262
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,540
 is we're looking at Jesus introduce himself to the world.

263
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,920
 And what's interesting is I don't know

264
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,440
 how you would introduce Jesus.

265
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,000
 Like if I asked you, hey, tell this person about Jesus,

266
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,880
 I don't know what the first things would be

267
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,840
 that you would say.

268
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,840
 But I will say this, my guess is it would not be like this.

269
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,000
 But let me tell you what we're gonna do.

270
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,920
 I'm here tonight and then next week,

271
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,020
 I'll tell you what we're gonna do is we look at Mark.

272
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,800
 Most people when they teach the gospels,

273
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,160
 if you look at your Bible, it's broken down

274
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,640
 in these little kind of bite-sized pieces.

275
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,120
 And most people just teach each little bite-sized piece,

276
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,000
 which is a great way to do it,

277
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,160
 but we don't have that kind of time, right?

278
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,560
 And those are neat little vignettes,

279
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,800
 but we're gonna do something a little different.

280
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,080
 Scholars call those little things pericopes,

281
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,180
 which we won't because that's a weird word.

282
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,240
 We'll call them moments.

283
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,920
 And usually the Bible breaks them up

284
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,960
 into these little moments and that's not bad.

285
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,160
 But the problem is if you just read the life of Jesus,

286
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,080
 that way you can miss some things.

287
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,860
 Like in chapter one, the section I just read,

288
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,160
 verses 21 to 39, in my Bible,

289
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,080
 they're broken up into three little independent sections.

290
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,520
 But if you just read the verses,

291
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,280
 that's one day in the life of Jesus, one crazy day.

292
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,620
 So what we're gonna do is just kind of fly over

293
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,960
 this section of Jesus introducing himself to the world.

294
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,720
 And we're gonna see his first impressions,

295
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,600
 how he came off to people.

296
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,200
 And we're gonna see his self-identification,

297
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,320
 how he wanted to introduce himself.

298
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,340
 And then we're gonna get some personal application for us.

299
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,940
 But to look at his first impressions,

300
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,660
 you see it in verse 14, as he launches his ministry,

301
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,640
 it says, "Jesus came into Galilee,

302
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,700
 "proclaiming the gospel of God, saying,

303
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,440
 "the time is fulfilled, the kingdom of God is at hand.

304
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,000
 "Repent and believe in the gospel."

305
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,800
 Now we could do a whole sermon on just that,

306
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,840
 on the kingdom of God, and that would be a great sermon,

307
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,320
 but we're not gonna.

308
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,920
 But even if you don't know what that means,

309
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,240
 you realize that sounds significant.

310
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,000
 He's saying there's a new era has arrived,

311
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,980
 there's a new system of rule that's present.

312
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,680
 He's not just walking around handing out hugs

313
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,480
 and being like, I just love you guys, right?

314
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,420
 He's saying something new has started now.

315
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,120
 It's a new governing of things.

316
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,320
 And then he says, "Repent, your whole life changes

317
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,600
 "right now because I'm here."

318
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,440
 And you read something like that,

319
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,560
 and you go, who talks like that?

320
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,440
 Who says that kind of stuff?

321
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,540
 I mean, how would you feel if I walked in here and said,

322
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,680
 your life changes forever today 'cause I'm here?

323
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,880
 You'd be like, who the heck are you?

324
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,960
 Who talks like that?

325
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,400
 But you don't get much time to think about it,

326
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,480
 'cause then in verse 16, it says he immediately

327
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,380
 starts calling people to him, and he says,

328
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,200
 "Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men."

329
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,040
 And it says immediately, they left their nets

330
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,280
 and they followed him.

331
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,920
 That Jesus is preaching this message,

332
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,080
 and then he comes up to people and says,

333
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,500
 you guys, follow me.

334
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,320
 That he doesn't just think he is someone

335
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,920
 that should be listened to,

336
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,140
 he thinks he's someone that should be followed,

337
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,480
 that your life should reprioritize to be around him.

338
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,600
 And what's crazy about that is he's walking,

339
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,680
 preaching this message, and he looks at guys and says,

340
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,880
 hey, you guys, follow me.

341
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,300
 That's crazy.

342
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,640
 What's even crazier is that they do.

343
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,520
 And their response is immediate and total.

344
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,320
 They drop the nets and follow him.

345
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,360
 Now, some of you hear that and you go,

346
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,680
 well, Ben, isn't that how they did it back then?

347
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,600
 Like rabbis, teachers would walk

348
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,800
 and their disciples would follow them?

349
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,400
 Didn't they all do it this way?

350
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,240
 No.

351
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,440
 Because back then, yes, you would follow a rabbi

352
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,440
 and a teacher, but you would stay at your job.

353
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,360
 Jesus says, follow me, and they drop their nets

354
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,180
 and follow him.

355
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,840
 Two of them that he calls later drop their net

356
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
 and their dad, they're like, uh, bye,

357
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,500
 and they just leave to follow him.

358
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,080
 And the other thing that was different was back then,

359
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,720
 you would pick the rabbi.

360
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,880
 The rabbi didn't pick you.

361
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,360
 You would say, I wanna learn from that guy,

362
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,280
 and you would go do it.

363
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,760
 It's like colleges.

364
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,320
 Baylor doesn't just call you and say,

365
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,200
 you, Baylor Bear, green shirts in the mail,

366
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,160
 get over here to Waco.

367
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,960
 It doesn't work that way.

368
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,460
 You pick where you wanna study.

369
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,400
 And yet Jesus is walking down the street and going,

370
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,800
 you two, get in the truck, and they're doing it.

371
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,920
 And so if you were some of the first people reading this,

372
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,240
 the natural question you would ask is,

373
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,680
 who calls people like, like, who talks to people like this?

374
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,660
 Change your life for me.

375
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,320
 And then they do it.

376
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,000
 What kind of guy is this?

377
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,440
 And then in verse 21, we jump into this crazy day with them,

378
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,120
 and it says, he took them into Capernaum,

379
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,800
 and immediately on the Sabbath,

380
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,360
 he entered the synagogue and was teaching.

381
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,640
 A synagogue was a place like this where you would teach.

382
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,120
 He steps in and starts teaching them the word of God,

383
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,480
 and it says, and they were astonished at his teaching,

384
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,960
 for he taught them as one who had authority

385
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,640
 and not as the scribes.

386
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,480
 He gets in there and he's blowing their mind

387
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,200
 because he doesn't sound like what they're used to.

388
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,280
 The scribes back then would read the words of God,

389
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,900
 and then they would always kind of quote other rabbis

390
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,640
 to sort of try to get around the interpretation.

391
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,140
 They're like, well, Halil says this,

392
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,880
 Gamalel believes it's coming from this angle,

393
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,160
 and they would just kind of teach it that way.

394
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,920
 They said, Jesus is astonishing them

395
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,580
 'cause when he walks in, he's teaching

396
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,520
 as if he has authority.

397
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,360
 He's teaching like you've heard it said, but I say to you.

398
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,720
 He's talking like he runs this place.

399
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,120
 And they're listening to him and they're going,

400
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,120
 uh, who talks like that?

401
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,480
 But they don't get long to think about it

402
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,040
 because it says, and immediately,

403
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,400
 there was in the synagogue a man with an unclean spirit,

404
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,260
 and he cried out, what have you to do with us,

405
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,160
 Jesus of Nazareth?

406
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,460
 Have you come to destroy us?

407
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,520
 I know who you are, the Holy One of God.

408
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,360
 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, be silent, come out of him,

409
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,120
 and the unclean spirit convulsing him

410
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,400
 and crying out with a loud voice came out of him,

411
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,340
 and they were all amazed,

412
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,200
 so that they questioned among themselves, saying,

413
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,840
 what is this, a new teaching with authority?

414
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,420
 He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.

415
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,440
 So Jesus is teaching in a way that's blowing their minds,

416
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,400
 but they don't even get much of a chance to think about it

417
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,960
 because all of a sudden, a demon-possessed guy

418
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,120
 starts losing his mind,

419
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,680
 which makes for a very memorable church service, right?

420
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,080
 [audience laughing]

421
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,680
 And Jesus casts out the demon.

422
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,040
 Jesus just shuts it down.

423
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,400
 And what's crazy about that is it says they were amazed,

424
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,540
 but did you see why?

425
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,580
 They weren't amazed that he cast out a demon.

426
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,080
 There were other people doing that.

427
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,760
 And there wasn't even amazing things

428
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,680
 about the way he did it.

429
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,400
 The way he did it was, in a sense,

430
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,280
 similar to what other exorcists in the time would do.

431
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,000
 You would always call the demon to be silent

432
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,200
 and then call it to come out.

433
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,680
 It says what amazed them was Jesus's authority

434
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,640
 as he did it, because the exorcists in the day back there,

435
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,240
 they would call a demon to be silent

436
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,560
 in the name of the most high.

437
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,360
 They would invoke a higher power.

438
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,520
 And then they would call it to come out

439
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,080
 with different chants and incantations

440
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,360
 and different things like that to try to call it out.

441
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,320
 Jesus doesn't do any of that.

442
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,760
 He doesn't call on any other power than his own.

443
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,320
 This guy literally starts freaking out.

444
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,740
 Ah, stop it.

445
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,580
 And it's done.

446
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,960
 [audience laughing]

447
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,280
 It would have made a very boring exorcism movie, you know?

448
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,040
 Because there's no like twirling heads,

449
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,880
 no one climbing a wall.

450
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,800
 Literally he's like, ah, stop, credits roll.

451
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,760
 It would have been a very short film.

452
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,560
 And it says the people see this

453
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,240
 and they have no category for this.

454
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,520
 They go, this is a level of power we're not familiar with.

455
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,760
 Who talks like this?

456
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,560
 And who has control over the spiritual world like this?

457
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,440
 What kind of authority is this?

458
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,360
 And it says, and immediately he left the synagogue

459
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,760
 and entered the house of Simon and Andrew

460
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,720
 with James and John.

461
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,920
 And Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with fever

462
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,920
 and immediately they told him about her.

463
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,680
 And he came and took her hand and lifted her up

464
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,520
 and the fever left and she began to serve them.

465
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,840
 So he's teaching powerfully, great.

466
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,180
 And then he's exercising spiritual power, that's awesome.

467
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,880
 But now we got a physical issue.

468
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,320
 I mean, this isn't the intangibles

469
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,600
 of teaching the spiritual world.

470
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,800
 This is physical sickness fever, right?

471
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,640
 Jesus walks in, says, mother-in-law's sick.

472
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,720
 And so he walks up and just casts out the fever.

473
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,020
 Fever out, right?

474
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,960
 And it's not just like the fever broke

475
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,600
 that suddenly she got better and they were like,

476
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,720
 oh, Jesus takes credit for it.

477
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,640
 That was me guys, right?

478
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,200
 And then she lays in bed the rest of the day

479
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,600
 and drinks fluids and try to recover.

480
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,840
 It's that he touches her and it's gone.

481
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,960
 And she goes from ill to popping up.

482
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,160
 And Mark lets you know that 'cause he says,

483
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,520
 she just popped up and started serving people.

484
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,760
 She's like more tea, John, scone, bill.

485
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,120
 And she's just ready to go.

486
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,920
 And you look at this and the question that you ask

487
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,320
 when you see that is,

488
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,240
 who has authority over the physical world like that?

489
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,440
 He just told a fever what to do and it did it.

490
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,320
 And it says by the end of it,

491
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,280
 the whole city's at the door wondering what kind of guy

492
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,880
 we just got ourselves into here.

493
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,160
 Now, let me just stop right there.

494
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,400
 And let's just, before we continue, look at something.

495
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,920
 I want you to see what was Jesus's first impression

496
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,760
 with these first people that met him.

497
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,680
 If you were to ask them, hey, tell me about Jesus.

498
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,660
 What was the first thing that stood out to them,

499
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,160
 that burned into their minds that they were talking about?

500
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,100
 What stood out about Jesus to them was his authority.

501
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,220
 Was his authority.

502
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,160
 Not his wisdom, though he was wise.

503
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,440
 Not even his love per se, though he is loving.

504
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,960
 What stood out to them, what they would think of

505
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,060
 when they thought of Jesus was authority.

506
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,860
 He commands people as if he thinks he has the right

507
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,760
 to command people.

508
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,120
 He commands the unseen world as if he believes

509
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,280
 he has the right to command the unseen world.

510
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,720
 He commands nature as if he thinks he has the right

511
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,040
 to command nature.

512
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,800
 And it looks like all those fears agree with him.

513
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,000
 What kind of guy is this?

514
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,640
 What kind of authority is this?

515
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,640
 I wonder if that's what you think of

516
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,980
 when you think of Jesus.

517
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,580
 Is that the Jesus that comes to mind

518
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,600
 when you think about him?

519
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,460
 That he walks in with that kind of authority?

520
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,720
 Or do you see him more like they do on South Park

521
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,840
 or Family Guy?

522
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,640
 Just a little guy in a bathrobe.

523
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,220
 I remember I was at a wedding once

524
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,760
 with a bunch of Navy SEALs.

525
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,080
 That's another story I won't unpack,

526
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,840
 but getting to visit with them.

527
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,200
 I appreciated the honesty at one moment with one guy.

528
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,280
 We were just visiting and he said,

529
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,240
 "Man, I'm the most effing not religious person

530
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,160
 "you're ever gonna meet."

531
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,360
 Just kind of dropped it on me.

532
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,640
 And I was like, "Okay, rockin', all right."

533
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,280
 And that's how we started the conversation.

534
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,240
 But I remember as we sat in that church,

535
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,320
 we were looking up at this stained glass window.

536
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,580
 And it was this picture of Jesus.

537
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,720
 And he was just like, just this tiny, tiny little guy

538
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,040
 and with long hair and just looked,

539
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,280
 he was like petting his sheep.

540
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,920
 And he just looked adorable and small.

541
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,060
 And I remember looking at that and just saying,

542
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,340
 "Hey man, you know he was nothing like that, right?

543
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,980
 "That the people who met him,

544
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,040
 "what struck them about him was his authority,

545
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,540
 "that he runs this place."

546
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,860
 But what's interesting, if you notice,

547
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,320
 they don't start following at his feet

548
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,460
 and calling him Lord yet.

549
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,920
 They don't start worshiping.

550
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,380
 Truthfully, they see the power,

551
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,380
 but they don't know what to do with him.

552
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,780
 So they start doing what a lot of people do.

553
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,900
 They start trying to put him in a box,

554
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,180
 trying to figure out what box to put him in.

555
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,260
 And there's two popular boxes they start to put him in.

556
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,800
 And incidentally, they're the same boxes

557
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,380
 we tend to put him in.

558
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,940
 The first group starts to put him

559
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,900
 in like the healing helper box.

560
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,060
 Like, "Oh, he's the guy that's just here

561
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,440
 "to help us with a problem.

562
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,580
 "So I just, I come to him if I have a problem,

563
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,020
 "he fixes it, we high five, and I leave."

564
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,940
 And some people wanna treat him that way.

565
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,900
 And some of us do too.

566
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,100
 You go, "I don't really want anything to do with Jesus

567
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,740
 "unless I have a problem, then I'll pray

568
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,380
 "'cause I got a problem, and if he fixes it, great,

569
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,260
 "and I'm gonna move on."

570
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,940
 And incidentally, that's one reason

571
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,140
 why some people approach him.

572
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,820
 That's the same reason why some of your friends reject him.

573
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,180
 Is it not?

574
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,740
 And you've heard people say that to you.

575
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,020
 Yeah, yeah, you are into Jesus

576
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,860
 because you need him to solve your problems

577
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,440
 because you're weak and frail and need that.

578
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,020
 I, on the other hand, am not a weak person.

579
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,100
 I am self-sufficient, so I don't need your religious crutch.

580
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,500
 I don't need your Jesus, right?

581
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,980
 And that's the first box they wanna put him in,

582
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,480
 kinda your healing helper guy.

583
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,260
 What's funny is after this crazy day,

584
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,940
 Jesus goes out early to pray that morning,

585
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,380
 they go look for him, and the disciples are like,

586
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,640
 "Dude, everybody's looking for you.

587
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,320
 "They all want their friends healed.

588
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,340
 "Let's set up shop, it's healing ministry time, let's go!"

589
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,900
 And Jesus says, "No, no, I'm not doing that."

590
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,300
 He's not anti-healing, but he says,

591
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,200
 "No, I need to keep moving

592
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,780
 "because I have a message to preach,

593
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,800
 "and the miracles, they serve a message.

594
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,500
 "I'm not just here to solve problems.

595
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,300
 "I have something to say to you about your life.

596
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,360
 "The miracles serve a message I wanna preach to you."

597
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,800
 Now, some people hear that and you go,

598
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,980
 "Okay, I see where you're going.

599
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,200
 "He's not the little healing helper buddy.

600
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,380
 "You're gonna say he's authority, he's power,

601
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,540
 "he's sort of the religious rule maker,

602
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,300
 "like here it comes, I'm used to this.

603
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,620
 "He's the one that's gonna charge in

604
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,380
 "and starts telling me you're making a mess of your life.

605
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,660
 "You need to quit sleeping with her.

606
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,620
 "Don't drink that, don't smoke that, don't touch her.

607
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,180
 "Oh, here we go."

608
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,420
 He's the guy that's gonna drop some rules on us.

609
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,260
 Well, what's interesting,

610
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,900
 and we won't read through this section,

611
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,140
 but Jesus heals a leper,

612
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,260
 and once he does that, his ministry blows up,

613
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,860
 which just, if any of you are in ministry,

614
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,740
 just a little FYI.

615
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,700
 If you ever heal a leper, buckle up

616
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,060
 because it goes crazy, all right?

617
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,220
 And it gets to the point where he can't go anywhere.

618
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,860
 Everywhere he goes, he's getting mobbed.

619
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,460
 He's like Justin Bieber in a Hollister.

620
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,460
 It's crazy everywhere he goes.

621
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,740
 And once that happens,

622
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,540
 the religious leadership of the day takes interest in him.

623
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,420
 They go, "Oh, we got a religious guy on the scene

624
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,500
 "that's kind of blowing up."

625
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,740
 And so they start showing up to check and make sure

626
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,480
 that he's sitting in the appropriate religious box.

627
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,620
 The problem with Jesus, though,

628
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,120
 is he just gets out of all your boxes.

629
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,620
 And so what's interesting is if we get to Mark chapter two,

630
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,140
 Jesus starts to introduce himself,

631
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,740
 and Mark just ties together these five stories in a row

632
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,940
 of his interaction with these religious leaders,

633
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,180
 and they basically get in fights the whole time.

634
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,980
 And it's fights over Jesus's identity.

635
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,060
 And Jesus says, "No, I'll identify myself,

636
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,480
 "and I don't fit into these boxes of yours."

637
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,060
 And so we won't go in deep on all five,

638
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,540
 but we'll look at one.

639
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,400
 He goes to Capernaum in chapter two, verse one,

640
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,460
 and he's preaching, and the house is packed.

641
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,460
 People can't get in.

642
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,740
 It's just wall to wall,

643
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,400
 and there's some guys with a paralytic friend.

644
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,100
 They got a friend who's paralyzed on a mat.

645
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,500
 They wanna get him to Jesus 'cause Jesus heals people,

646
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,060
 and they can't get in, the place is packed.

647
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,540
 So they climb up on the roof of the place,

648
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,380
 rip the roof open, and lower their buddy down

649
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,780
 right in front of Jesus, like you do, right?

650
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,700
 And Jesus doesn't get mad about it.

651
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,820
 He's not like, "What is this?"

652
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,320
 Or I mean, he's not anti-healing,

653
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,460
 but he doesn't heal the guy right away.

654
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,300
 He just stops and is like,

655
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,140
 "All right, stay paralyzed for a second."

656
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,260
 And he decides to use this as a teaching illustration.

657
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,720
 And it says he gets into this moment

658
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,180
 that when he saw their faith,

659
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,780
 he says to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven.

660
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,720
 "Your sins are forgiven."

661
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,940
 Now he's been healing other people

662
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,380
 without maybe even saying anything.

663
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,260
 This is something else.

664
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,620
 He decides to use this as a teaching moment and says,

665
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,100
 "Son, your sins are forgiven."

666
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,920
 And it says, "Now some of the scribes are sitting there

667
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,320
 "questioning their heart,

668
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,020
 "why does this man speak like that?

669
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,260
 "He's blaspheming.

670
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,540
 "Who can forgive sins but God alone?"

671
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,300
 And that's a good question.

672
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,740
 They say, "Hey, who talks like that?

673
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,140
 "And who does talk like that?"

674
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,380
 I mean, honestly, it would be like

675
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,900
 if you two were in a fight right now.

676
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,300
 Like let's say something went sideways, yes, y'all.

677
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,420
 And let's say something just went really crazy

678
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,420
 between the two of you and it's ugly and you're fighting

679
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,660
 and you're like, "Relationship's far from over.

680
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,800
 "This may turn, you know, like police involvement.

681
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,380
 "Like it's getting ugly."

682
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,000
 Imagine if I stepped into that moment and was like,

683
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,500
 "Well, shh, I forgive you."

684
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,820
 (congregation laughing)

685
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,840
 You'd be like, "Who are you?

686
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,140
 "Like you're not a part of this."

687
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,100
 And if I was like, "Shh,

688
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,180
 "then I wipe away every wrong you've ever done."

689
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,900
 (congregation laughing)

690
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,980
 You'd be like, "Who do you think you are?"

691
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,380
 And that's what they're saying.

692
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,780
 Like, "Oh, this guy's a good preacher.

693
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,020
 "Oh, this guy can heal people.

694
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,120
 "Now suddenly he's up there taking a divine prerogative.

695
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,260
 "Your sins are forgiven."

696
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,820
 And they're in the back throwing penalty flags.

697
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,940
 Like, "He can't talk like that.

698
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,020
 "What's that guy doing?

699
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,980
 "Only God can do that."

700
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,340
 And what's crazy is they actually don't even get to say it

701
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,340
 out loud, it's just they're questioning in their heart

702
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,180
 who does this.

703
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,260
 And while they're questioning in their heart who does this,

704
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,500
 it says immediately Jesus perceived this and said,

705
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,500
 "Which is easier?

706
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,780
 "Which is easier?

707
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,720
 "To say paralytic rise or your sins are forgiven?

708
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,600
 "Which is easier?

709
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,600
 "Which is easier?"

710
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,060
 Yeah, they're about as quiet as you are.

711
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,100
 It's a hard question.

712
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,460
 At the end of the day, the answer is it depends, right?

713
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,900
 I mean, in one sense,

714
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,020
 to say your sins are forgiven is easier.

715
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,460
 Why?

716
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,140
 Because there's no way to verify if it really worked or not.

717
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,460
 So I could say that all day long, right?

718
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,140
 And in that sense, to say to someone who's paralyzed,

719
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,160
 "Get up and walk" is infinitely harder

720
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,060
 'cause that's instantly verifiable.

721
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,980
 You're gonna know if I got the juice to pull that off

722
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,020
 in about five seconds if the dude can get up or not, right?

723
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,760
 But on the other side,

724
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,580
 only God can forgive your sin.

725
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,820
 That's infinitely harder.

726
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,120
 And so Jesus asked them, "Which is harder?"

727
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,760
 They can't answer that.

728
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,040
 And so Jesus takes those two things and ties it together

729
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,600
 and says, "So that you may know

730
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,320
 "that the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins,

731
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,640
 "get up and walk."

732
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,560
 And the guy rises and they're amazed and they glorify God.

733
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,660
 What kind of guy can forgive sin?

734
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,500
 What kind of guy can step into our crazy

735
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,940
 and make it peaceful?

736
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,040
 What kind of guy is this?

737
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,460
 Conflict number two is Jesus is hanging out

738
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,960
 with the party crowd.

739
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,260
 He goes to a party at Matthew's house.

740
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,640
 Matthew throws crazy parties.

741
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,020
 The religious people say, "You can't do that.

742
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,980
 "You can't show up there."

743
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,460
 And what's interesting is Jesus doesn't look

744
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,340
 at the religious people and go, "Y'all need to relax.

745
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,360
 "Y'all are being legalists.

746
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,380
 "Just calm down."

747
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,020
 Like he doesn't pick a side.

748
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,000
 Like they say, "You can't be there."

749
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,840
 And Jesus says, "These guys are sick

750
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,080
 "and they are sick."

751
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,560
 He says to seek to fill the vacancies in your heart

752
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:24,560
 with things or sex or some sort of new trick

753
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,800
 or exciting thing, he says, "That's not sufficient."

754
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,000
 He says, "What they're doing, that desperate insecurity,"

755
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,760
 he says, "It's a sickness."

756
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,240
 But then he says, "They're sick.

757
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,000
 "But I'm the cure.

758
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,300
 "I'm the cure."

759
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,620
 Who talks like that?

760
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,940
 Who says something like that?

761
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,340
 All the brokenness in you, I can fix it.

762
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,160
 I can fix it.

763
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,980
 His disciples don't fast.

764
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,020
 The Jewish religious people back then would fast,

765
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,380
 go without food certain days,

766
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,220
 and it was a remorn over their sin,

767
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,180
 hoping that one day God would send the Messiah,

768
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,980
 his official representative that would fix things.

769
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,800
 So they come to him and say,

770
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,180
 "Why aren't your disciples doing that?"

771
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,640
 And what's interesting is Jesus could have just said,

772
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,280
 "Oh, they'll fast later."

773
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,380
 But Jesus says something else.

774
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,480
 He says, "They're not fasting

775
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,660
 "'cause the bridegroom's here,

776
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,980
 "'cause the bridegroom's here."

777
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,460
 That was a wildly arrogant thing to say.

778
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,020
 Because all through the prophetic writings,

779
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,420
 the bridegroom, the husband of his people,

780
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,240
 the one that was gonna come and love your soul

781
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,500
 for better and for worse, always and forever, is God alone.

782
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,840
 And Jesus says, "My boys aren't fasting, you know why?

783
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,860
 "'Cause the bridegroom's here."

784
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,740
 And they're like, "How can you say that?

785
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,440
 "That's who God is, and you're talking like that."

786
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,500
 They see him the next Sabbath,

787
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,100
 and he's walking with his disciples,

788
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,580
 and they're plucking grain,

789
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,500
 and they're rolling the little chaff off

790
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,620
 so they can eat the grain,

791
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,800
 and the religious leaders call him on it.

792
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,760
 They said, "You can't do that.

793
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,960
 "That's harvesting.

794
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,860
 "Harvesting's illegal on the Sabbath."

795
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,440
 And that's a conflict.

796
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,340
 And Jesus could have said to them,

797
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,220
 "Well, technically, just running your hands together

798
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,620
 "and eating a little seed is not harvesting

799
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,380
 "if you read the Hebrew in its original text."

800
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,300
 He could have done it that way,

801
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,400
 and that would have been a legitimate way.

802
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,060
 He goes the harder way and says,

803
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,820
 "You guys have completely missed

804
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,180
 "the heart of God in the Bible.

805
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,600
 "You have missed God entirely.

806
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,960
 "Even though you have the Bible memorized,

807
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,020
 "you got it all sideways.

808
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,520
 "You guys don't understand that God put his word out there

809
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,340
 "to bless us, not to tyrannize us.

810
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,380
 "You guys are mixed up on who God even is."

811
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,540
 That was the gutsier way.

812
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,380
 And he could have stopped there,

813
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,660
 and that would have been like, "Whoa, that was intense."

814
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:41,100
 But then he goes, "And I'm the Lord of the Sabbath."

815
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,380
 (congregation laughing)

816
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,980
 He says, "This day set aside to worship God alone,

817
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,720
 "that's my day.

818
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,540
 "That's my day.

819
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,320
 "That day is about me."

820
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,780
 And then on the next Sabbath,

821
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,260
 he picks a guy up in front of them

822
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,980
 and he's got a withered hand.

823
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,620
 And he says, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"

824
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,860
 And they're sitting in the back like, "Don't you dare."

825
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,100
 And he just goes, "Healed."

826
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:13,540
 And if you were making a movie about it,

827
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,420
 that's when you would kick in the soundtrack

828
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,660
 of like Rihanna singing,

829
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,100
 "Who's Gonna Run This Town Tonight?"

830
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:18,940
 You know what I mean?

831
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,220
 You're just like, "This guy is mic dropping these people."

832
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,380
 And by the end of it, it says, "They wanna kill him

833
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,860
 "'cause they understand what he's doing.

834
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,260
 "He's saying, 'I'm not just a religious teacher

835
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,300
 "'and I'm not just your little buddy.

836
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,340
 "'I am in a class all my own.

837
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,700
 "'You have never met anyone like me.'"

838
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,380
 Who runs the world like that?

839
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,540
 Who runs the spiritual world like that?

840
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,300
 Who can look into the darkness of my soul

841
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,480
 and say, "I can fix that.

842
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,860
 "I'm here to fix that."

843
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,680
 Who can look at us and say,

844
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,340
 "Yeah, this place is broken and sad,

845
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,340
 "but I'm here to bring the joy of a wedding day."

846
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,740
 Who talks like that?

847
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,580
 Who does that?

848
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,300
 You've never seen anyone like him.

849
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,740
 C.S. Lewis said it this way,

850
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,100
 "On one side, clear, definite moral teaching.

851
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,880
 "On the other, claims which if not true

852
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,860
 "are those of a megalomaniac

853
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,080
 "compared with whom Hitler was the most sane

854
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,920
 "and humblest of men.

855
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,360
 "Jesus told people their sins were forgiven.

856
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,700
 "This makes sense only if he really was the God

857
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,160
 "whose laws were broken

858
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,080
 "and whose love is wounded in every sin.

859
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,820
 "I am trying here to prevent anyone from saying

860
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,580
 "the really foolish thing that people often say about him.

861
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,940
 "I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher,

862
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,260
 "but I don't accept his claims to be God.

863
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,940
 "That is the one thing we must not say.

864
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,860
 "A man who is merely a man

865
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,700
 "and said the sort of things Jesus said

866
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,620
 "would not be a great moral teacher.

867
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,240
 "He'd be either a lunatic

868
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,680
 "on the level of a man who says he's a poached egg,

869
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,820
 "or else he would be a devil of hell.

870
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,580
 "You can shut him up for a fool,

871
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,680
 "spit on him and kill him as a demon,

872
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,040
 "or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God,

873
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,620
 "but let none of us come up with this patronizing nonsense

874
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,880
 "about him being a great human teacher.

875
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,460
 "He's not left that open to us.

876
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,640
 "He did not intend to."

877
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,480
 He stepped into this place and says,

878
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,420
 "This is my world, this is my kingdom.

879
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,700
 "I run this place."

880
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,140
 The first impression is his authority.

881
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,800
 And as he introduces himself, he says,

882
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,460
 "You've never met anyone like me.

883
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,760
 "I'm God on earth, the Son of God,

884
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,720
 "with all God's authority right here,

885
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,500
 "and I've come for you."

886
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,340
 And when a man makes a claim like that,

887
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,120
 you're really only left with two options,

888
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,560
 allegiance or rebellion.

889
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,500
 Allegiance or rebellion.

890
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,340
 Now, some of us hear that and we're really uncomfortable

891
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,540
 because you're like, "Ugh.

892
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:45,800
 "I, man, I don't like authority."

893
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,420
 So if you're saying the goal of tonight

894
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,860
 was Jesus is your authority,

895
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,980
 yes, that is the goal of tonight.

896
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,080
 If you're like, "My only problem is I don't like authority.

897
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,200
 "I don't want anyone telling me what to do,

898
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,260
 "so I don't like this."

899
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,860
 Well, let me just say this.

900
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,180
 You want authority.

901
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,140
 You do.

902
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,620
 Maybe not all the time,

903
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,940
 but when things really go sideways for you

904
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,160
 and stuff begins to break,

905
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,120
 you want somebody that can show up and lead this place.

906
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:18,860
 So I remember, I remember when Katrina hit New Orleans.

907
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,020
 I remember listening to the radio

908
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,980
 and the mayor is crying,

909
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,860
 like the mayor that's supposed to be strong

910
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,480
 and tell people where to go.

911
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,020
 They asked the mayor, "What are we gonna do?"

912
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,080
 And he just starts crying on the radio.

913
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,060
 And the announcer starts crying.

914
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,940
 And I'm sitting there in the car

915
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,580
 just listening to these two grown men

916
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,020
 just heave and make noises.

917
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,260
 They have no answers.

918
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,540
 They're just in need and they start crying.

919
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,600
 Shepard Smith.

920
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,420
 He's standing out there on an overpass,

921
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,500
 dead bodies that nobody's picking up,

922
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,420
 and he just starts crying on national TV.

923
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,660
 Like he's got no answers, no power.

924
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,600
 All he has is helplessness in the face of problems

925
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,700
 he can't solve, and he just starts crying.

926
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,460
 And I remember watching this all over,

927
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,380
 of going, "Somebody help us."

928
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,700
 And I'll never forget, I was watching the news

929
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,540
 when Lieutenant General Russell Honore got off the helicopter

930
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,860
 that they sent a general.

931
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,060
 And I remember he stepped off that helicopter

932
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,220
 with just the badges rolling down his chest.

933
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,500
 And even the news,

934
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,820
 people that are meant to be professional

935
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,180
 or a little skeptical of the media were fawning over him.

936
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,420
 They were just like, "Are you here to tell us what to do?

937
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,860
 "Oh, just send us places."

938
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,340
 And I remember he would just walk up and be like,

939
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,320
 "You, carry those sandbags.

940
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,160
 "You, carry that water.

941
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,980
 "You, just run around in circles.

942
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,820
 "You."

943
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,020
 And he would just start telling everyone what to do.

944
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,640
 And they were all like, "Yes, sir, that's awesome.

945
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,480
 "I'm on it."

946
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,720
 And off they would go.

947
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,100
 There was such relief and such joy

948
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,820
 'cause in the midst of my chaos and pain,

949
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,800
 somebody is here to tell me what to do

950
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,740
 that'll help me and give me life.

951
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,660
 And so we may say, "Ben, I don't want an authority

952
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,540
 "over my life," but let me tell you something.

953
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,980
 We're all one phone call away

954
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,740
 from being brought to our knees.

955
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:58,160
 We're too frail in this world, whether we know it or not.

956
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,040
 We really are.

957
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,700
 And some of us, external crises will help us see that,

958
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,220
 problems we can't control.

959
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,780
 Some of us, it's the internal stuff.

960
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,680
 There's things going on in you that you don't like.

961
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,180
 And as much as you try to dial in your discipline,

962
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,140
 we can't fix you.

963
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,700
 And you're starting to develop some secrets

964
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,500
 that are eating you alive.

965
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,900
 And you're starting to get scared.

966
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,060
 And you're wondering who's gonna step in and help you.

967
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,700
 We want an authority.

968
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,100
 We do.

969
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,460
 We might be scared of it, some of us,

970
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,820
 because people who had authority in our lives before

971
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,740
 used it to abuse us.

972
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,700
 And that was wrong.

973
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,580
 But Jesus steps in and says, "I'm your authority,

974
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,200
 "whether you like it or not.

975
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,820
 "But look at what kind of king he is.

976
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,060
 "How does he use his power?

977
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,520
 "He comes to the person who's unclean,

978
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,700
 "and he makes them clean.

979
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,340
 "He comes to the people who are sick,

980
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,640
 "and he makes them okay.

981
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,780
 "He comes to the people who are lonely and desperate,

982
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,640
 "and brings them the joy of a wedding day.

983
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,560
 "Look at what kind of king we have.

984
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,400
 "Look at him."

985
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,580
 Bob Dylan sang it, "You're gonna serve somebody.

986
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,380
 "It may be the devil, it may be the Lord,

987
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,500
 "but you're gonna serve somebody.

988
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,120
 "Look at this king.

989
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,540
 "His power is in service of his love."

990
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:29,120
 C.S. Lewis, whose quote I read earlier,

991
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,620
 was an atheist, a very proud one,

992
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,200
 very defiant one, as he taught at Oxford.

993
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,300
 Became a Christian.

994
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,560
 I read the first book he wrote after he became a Christian.

995
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,040
 It was an allegory.

996
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,200
 And it's really raw.

997
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,920
 He like cusses in it, and he's very upset.

998
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,320
 But his picture of becoming a Christian

999
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,520
 in this allegorical story is of the character

1000
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,640
 being forced down a mountain in the rain at night

1001
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,880
 by sword point to have to go drown himself.

1002
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,520
 C.S. Lewis was not excited about becoming a Christian.

1003
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,480
 [audience laughs]

1004
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,560
 But he couldn't get away from this little carpenter

1005
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,280
 from Nazareth who changed the world and said he was God.

1006
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,800
 And so he bowed his knees and was the lowliest,

1007
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,260
 saddest convert in all of London.

1008
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,800
 But then he wrote a biography about his experience.

1009
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,700
 It wasn't an allegory.

1010
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,760
 It was his actual conversion experience

1011
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,880
 told from his life story,

1012
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,000
 and he entitled it "Surprised by Joy."

1013
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,980
 He said, "I saw that he really was who he said he was,

1014
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,920
 "and I fell to my knees 'cause I had nowhere else to go.

1015
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,560
 "And what I found there was the joy I had longed for,

1016
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,940
 "that he's the king and he's good."

1017
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,040
 Let me pray for us.

1018
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:55,940
 God, you came here with all the authority of heaven.

1019
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:00,720
 You taught like you ran this place 'cause you do.

1020
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,520
 You commanded the unseen world

1021
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,320
 because it's yours to command.

1022
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,840
 You commanded this physical world

1023
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,240
 because you hold it together by the word of your power.

1024
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,920
 You, Jesus Christ, the Son of God,

1025
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,840
 rule this place even now, and all of us.

1026
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,520
 There's no secrets here, no surprises,

1027
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,640
 no one off your radar.

1028
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,120
 And yet with all that power, how do you use it?

1029
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,880
 You talk to us.

1030
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,060
 You grab the hand of an old woman who's hurting

1031
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,160
 and make it okay.

1032
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,340
 You grab a guy that's unclean,

1033
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,740
 and you do the impossible.

1034
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:46,120
 You don't become dirty by touching him, you make him clean.

1035
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,160
 And some of us just really need that, really want that.

1036
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,680
 You make the people who are empty full.

1037
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,800
 You make the sad joyful.

1038
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,400
 You live the perfect life we could not,

1039
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,360
 and you came to sacrifice your life.

1040
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,920
 Greater love has no man than this,

1041
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,640
 that he'd lay down his life for his friends.

1042
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,080
 You went to the cross to move our sin and shame

1043
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,480
 out of the way, to open up a relationship with God.

1044
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,680
 All of your power used in service of your love

1045
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,560
 to take lonely, wayward, broken, sick people

1046
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,680
 and make us holy, loved, adopted,

1047
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,780
 cherished children of God.

1048
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,520
 Thank you, King Jesus.

1049
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,640
 We joyfully submit to you.

1050
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,960
 And God, I know there wasn't a lot of application

1051
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,520
 in this sermon, I wrestled with that,

1052
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,760
 but the truth is there's a thousand

1053
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,020
 or 2,000 problems in here.

1054
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,200
 I couldn't illustrate them all if I wanted to,

1055
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,140
 but we have them.

1056
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,000
 And many of us, what we need is not a three-step plan

1057
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,300
 of how to get our mess together, what we need is a hero.

1058
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,840
 And so God, I just pray even now

1059
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,640
 as we have a moment to talk to you,

1060
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,400
 we could come honestly, and some people in this room

1061
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,620
 need to just say, okay, I'm ready to belong to Jesus.

1062
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,420
 If he's calling people to himself, I'm in, I want in.

1063
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,240
 If he's forgiving sin, I need forgiveness.

1064
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,520
 If he's cleansing people, I need cleansing.

1065
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,560
 I want on the team, give me the jersey.

1066
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,520
 And if that's you, you cry out to him

1067
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,760
 and tell the person who brought you,

1068
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,440
 tell one of the pastors here, we'd love to encourage you

1069
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,480
 and celebrate with you and walk with you.

1070
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,920
 And God, for those of us that know you,

1071
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,760
 maybe we've been walking with you every moment of every day

1072
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,720
 right up until this moment, or maybe it's been a long time,

1073
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,680
 but what we need more than anything tonight

1074
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,960
 is not a technique, what we need is to sit

1075
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,160
 at the feet of our hero.

1076
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,740
 That as we look into the face of Jesus, we see God.

1077
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:54,220
 The God who said, let light shine out of darkness,

1078
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,120
 shown into our hearts to show us the glory of God

1079
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,080
 in the face of Christ.

1080
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:03,800
 And in beholding him, we are changed from glory to glory.

1081
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:10,840
 Guys are gonna lead us to respond to Jesus in song

1082
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,560
 and you can sing it, but I wanna challenge you,

1083
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,600
 whatever you're bringing in here, lay it at his feet.

1084
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,700
 He cares and he's strong.

1085
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,560
 And maybe not all the answers will come tonight,

1086
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,900
 but there's peace in knowing that the king of the universe

1087
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,120
 knows my name and cares.

1088
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,280
 We rest in you, our good and loving king, Jesus.

1089
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,780
 (music fades)

1090
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:45,780
