 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:27,520
 All right, all right.

3
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,880
 How we doing tonight?

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,280
 Come on.

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,560
 Oh, we can do better than that.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,480
 Let's go, porch.

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,360
 [CHEERING]

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,840
 There we go.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,680
 Hey, I want to welcome you to the porch.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,560
 My name is Josiah.

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,480
 I have the privilege of serving on staff here.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,480
 And man, let me just give a warm welcome to our Porch Live

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,600
 locations that are watching.

00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,560
 Porch Live Tulsa, Porch Live Boise, Scottsdale, Des Moines,

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,560
 Midland, Texas, and for the very first time,

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,760
 the Porch Live Doralstown, Pennsylvania.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,800
 Y'all give it up.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,720
 And my friends right here in Dallas, Texas, welcome.

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,840
 Anybody have a good 4th of July?

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,760
 Yeah?

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,120
 Man, I missed y'all.

22
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,240
 Like, this is one of my favorite times of the week

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,520
 to gather in this place.

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,280
 And last week was the 4th.

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,120
 So my family and I, we got away to East Texas.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,920
 And we went on a little lake house vacation.

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,840
 And here's my crew.

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,240
 Hopefully-- yep, there they are.

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,240
 That's my wife, Kathy, with my best man in my wedding, Joe,

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,000
 and his wife, Haley, and their kids.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,240
 But then I got my oldest.

32
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,960
 She's over here doing a little hip thing.

33
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,960
 That's Camille.

34
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,720
 And then I got--

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,720
 I don't know how I came up with the blonde hair, blue eye.

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,640
 She's in the middle.

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,440
 She's kind of lost.

38
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,720
 She don't know what she's kind of doing.

39
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,160
 But she's doing her thing.

40
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,280
 She got the one recessive gene in the family.

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,520
 I'm not sure how she got all that blonde hair.

42
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,840
 But she did.

43
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,760
 And then I have the little man, Astros jersey.

44
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,880
 This is-- yeah.

45
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,760
 You just mean mugging.

46
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,520
 That's Caleb.

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,960
 And I'm like, bro, we're just trying

48
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,240
 to take a family pic-- 4th of July for the 'Gram,

49
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,400
 you know what I'm saying?

50
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,920
 And he couldn't smile.

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,720
 But that's my crew.

52
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,840
 About four years ago, to this month to be specific,

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,920
 my family and I moved from Kansas City to Dallas

54
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,480
 to come on staff here at Watermark

55
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,560
 and be a part of what God's doing here at the porch.

56
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,960
 And when we got to Dallas, we couldn't find a house.

57
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,800
 So we were homeless.

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,200
 Not really.

59
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,580
 We were living with some friends.

60
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,280
 But we were homeless for many months

61
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,600
 and trying to go from one house to another, just whoever

62
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,680
 would take us.

63
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,120
 And I get a phone call from my wife.

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,200
 And she said, Josiah, I found the house.

65
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,480
 And I'm like, OK.

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,340
 Send me a link.

67
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,440
 And she said, no, just jump in the car with me.

68
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,040
 We're going to go see the house.

69
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,880
 And I'm like, I know what that means.

70
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,280
 Because what you don't know, she's an interior designer.

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,800
 So she sees things that I don't see.

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
 She sees potential in things.

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,520
 She can beautify stuff that I can't.

74
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,760
 But I've already gone down this road with her before.

75
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,040
 So this is a red flag.

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,560
 Because in Kansas City, we bought a house.

77
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,240
 And we did the whole fixer upper thing.

78
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,720
 And I'm no Chip, OK?

79
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,560
 I'm not.

80
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,800
 She might be Joanna.

81
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,880
 But I'm far from Chip.

82
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,600
 I can demo.

83
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,640
 But I kind of mess things up even when I demo.

84
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
 I'm pretty good at cleaning things up.

85
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,120
 But that's about it.

86
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,520
 And so we pull up to this house.

87
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,320
 And I'm like, oh, no.

88
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:21,880
 No.

89
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,880
 This is not-- I don't know if the Lord gave you a word

90
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,560
 or he made it clear.

91
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,840
 This is just not the house.

92
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,680
 Like, the brick is orange, y'all.

93
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,880
 And when the sunlight hits it just right,

94
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,520
 it's like light pink.

95
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,360
 And I'm like, no.

96
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,400
 This is not the house.

97
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,880
 There's not a blade of grass in the yard.

98
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,360
 Like, it's all weeds.

99
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,840
 OK, I'm kind of a grass person.

100
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,920
 It's therapeutic for me.

101
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,080
 And then we go into the house.

102
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,840
 And I'm like, this whole thing needs to be gutted.

103
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,760
 This is a big project, y'all.

104
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,080
 Look at these bathrooms.

105
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,360
 I think we got a picture of the bathrooms.

106
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,240
 Oh.

107
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,400
 Oh.

108
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,640
 Yeah, you feel my pain.

109
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,520
 Next one.

110
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,280
 Yeah.

111
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,840
 I mean, this house is old.

112
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,280
 I mean, this is 1950s old.

113
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,160
 And I'm just like, this can't be happening.

114
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,600
 And so we start to process it.

115
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,720
 And I'm just cynical.

116
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,600
 I'm just being honest.

117
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,120
 Not the best way to be in your marriage.

118
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,160
 But I'm just confessing.

119
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,120
 This is a safe place.

120
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,440
 Don't look at me like you're crazy.

121
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,800
 Come on, you guys got your own thing.

122
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,640
 I might be cynical.

123
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,200
 And I might be judgmental at times with my wife

124
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,400
 and what she wants.

125
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,760
 But I'm cynical, man.

126
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,840
 I'm calling out everything I see in this house.

127
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,800
 So we bite.

128
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,280
 We bite the bullet.

129
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,920
 She talks me into it.

130
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,720
 And we think, hey, three to six months of remodel.

131
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,000
 And three months came and went.

132
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,080
 Six months came and went.

133
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,960
 And you know when your expectations don't really

134
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,840
 meet reality?

135
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,800
 You ever been there before?

136
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,640
 And you're just like, no, this is not what I had in mind.

137
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,880
 And candidly, over three years of now living in the house,

138
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,080
 we're still remodeling it in some way.

139
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,600
 And I start there tonight because I

140
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,120
 think sometimes this is how we feel about God.

141
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,560
 We say things like, God, I'm going

142
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,280
 to give you a certain amount of time

143
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,600
 to beautify this thing in my life that's really ugly.

144
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,800
 God, I don't really like what I see you doing.

145
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,240
 I don't really appreciate what I'm having to go through.

146
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,240
 I don't appreciate, hey, this job that I'm working at,

147
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,360
 it's my fourth job.

148
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,200
 And I'm 30.

149
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,720
 And I thought I was going to get the raise and the promotion.

150
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,560
 And it didn't happen.

151
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,320
 And I'm still sitting in debt.

152
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,920
 And these expectations aren't meeting reality.

153
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,640
 Maybe for you, you're single and 30.

154
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,360
 That's my story.

155
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,080
 Holler at your boy.

156
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,480
 Just like sitting in my 30s.

157
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,800
 And I'm like, God, you can show up anytime.

158
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,840
 You know what I'm saying?

159
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,920
 I'm waiting.

160
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,640
 And I had the mentality like, I'm following you, God.

161
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,520
 Like, I'm in my Bible.

162
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,120
 Yeah, like we're getting in God's word.

163
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,440
 And I'm memorizing scripture.

164
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,040
 And I got community.

165
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,200
 And I'm serving.

166
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,160
 Lord, I'm serving.

167
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,040
 And you know this, Lord, I'm giving money.

168
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,240
 Like I'm giving the 10% off the top to the church

169
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,080
 and to other ministries.

170
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,640
 God, you've got to be showing up for me.

171
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,240
 And your expectations aren't necessarily meeting reality.

172
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,480
 Maybe it's a strange relationship.

173
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,480
 And this relationship isn't being reconciled.

174
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
 Maybe a loved one just found out they had cancer.

175
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:36,360
 Maybe it's a death in your family.

176
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,240
 And you are starting to question God's ability

177
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,480
 to beautify your situation.

178
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,400
 And so what we try to do is we put God on this shot clock.

179
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,920
 We got this amount of time for him to do something.

180
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,520
 And now you find yourself, like me,

181
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,200
 in a lot of different seasons that I can look back

182
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,600
 on disappointed and discouraged with God.

183
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,840
 You're frustrated because he's not beautifying

184
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,880
 your life and your timing.

185
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,840
 And listen, God sits outside of time.

186
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,600
 Time doesn't exist in his kingdom.

187
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,040
 Time isn't in heaven.

188
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,800
 Like, there's no time in heaven.

189
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,880
 But this is all we know,

190
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,640
 and this is all of our minds can grasp.

191
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,320
 And we've been given a particular amount of time,

192
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,760
 and maybe today you walk in and you're just discouraged

193
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,760
 with how life is turning out.

194
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,680
 And so I want to just say a statement up front

195
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,320
 that I believe is biblically rooted.

196
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,680
 It's going to need some unpacking

197
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,900
 as we go throughout the message,

198
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,480
 but I just want to share this statement.

199
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,120
 And can I just go like East Texas twang on you for a minute?

200
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,960
 Can I just do that?

201
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,780
 You good with that?

202
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,780
 Like, it won't be the city boy, you know, perfect language,

203
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,000
 but let me just go East Texas country twang on you.

204
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,880
 If it ain't good, God ain't done.

205
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,040
 Okay?

206
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,800
 If it ain't good in your life, God ain't done.

207
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,640
 Another way of saying that,

208
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,160
 if something isn't good in your life,

209
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,980
 then God isn't done.

210
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,100
 And I'm going to show you where that is in scripture

211
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,320
 as we travel through the scripture tonight,

212
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,360
 but we're going to be in the book of Ecclesiastes

213
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,400
 and we're going to see God begin to show us

214
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,000
 that there's this time for everything.

215
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,900
 And then we're going to see

216
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,260
 that God makes everything beautiful in its time.

217
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,480
 And I don't want you to get lost with this statement

218
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,720
 because some of you would take this statement,

219
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,540
 it ain't good.

220
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,560
 If it ain't good, then God ain't done.

221
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,520
 It's like, well, if singleness, I guess, you know,

222
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,040
 God's just going to give me a spouse.

223
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:40,040
 Or it's like, you know, I'm destined to be a millionaire

224
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,900
 by the time I'm 35.

225
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,960
 And you just start having this name it and claim it,

226
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,880
 this health, wealth, and prosperity type of theology.

227
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,360
 And I don't think the problem with that is

228
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,720
 I just don't think our definition of good

229
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
 is the same as God's definition of good.

230
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,680
 And that's really the problem at the end of the day, amen?

231
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,320
 And so sometimes we're going to see

232
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,040
 as we unpack Ecclesiastes three,

233
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,800
 that God's definition is different than ours.

234
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,400
 And we're going to see throughout the scriptures

235
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,840
 as we cross-reference different ones across Earth

236
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,240
 throughout this time,

237
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,120
 we're going to see that sometimes God does allow pain

238
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,160
 and suffering to mark our life.

239
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,680
 So we're going to be in Ecclesiastes three.

240
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,640
 If you have a Bible, you can open up there,

241
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,080
 open it up to Ecclesiastes three.

242
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,880
 If you don't, then I just want to share this

243
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,000
 every single week.

244
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,240
 We have a Bible for you out in the town center.

245
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,600
 You can go to the welcome desk directly after the service,

246
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,720
 and we would love to give you a physical copy of God's word.

247
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,480
 And so we're going to be in Ecclesiastes three

248
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,160
 and we're going to study about a man named Solomon.

249
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,680
 History, not just the Bible,

250
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,660
 says that Solomon was actually a king.

251
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,500
 No one denies that.

252
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,080
 Every atheist who is well-studied will acknowledge

253
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,360
 that there's a very wealthy king named Solomon.

254
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,520
 Maybe the wealthiest to ever live, Wikipedia would say.

255
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,600
 We're learning from a man

256
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,640
 who was one of the most powerful people on the Earth.

257
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,120
 And in the end of his life, he's at the end of his life,

258
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,740
 and he's just writing out these journal entries.

259
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,200
 He's reflecting back on this experiment

260
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,760
 that really just failed miserably,

261
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,320
 that he was trying everything underneath the sun

262
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,200
 and it left him empty.

263
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,540
 An experiment where he was trying to find meaning in life.

264
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,560
 He finds it in pleasure and the party.

265
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,860
 Like this dude would throw massive parties.

266
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,960
 Like thousands of people would come to his party.

267
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,620
 He would try to find it in music.

268
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,780
 Like you think, hey, you know, Taylor Swift concert.

269
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,800
 Like Taylor Swift was playing in his backyard.

270
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,040
 Like that's the kind of person,

271
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,720
 like he owned the Billboard's top chart music.

272
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,080
 That was him.

273
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,320
 700 wives, the scripture says, 300 concubines.

274
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,940
 A concubine is just a live-in girlfriend.

275
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,920
 That's the kind of man we're talking about.

276
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,360
 This guy who had power.

277
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,760
 Think president of the United States,

278
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,920
 a man who was the wisest in his day.

279
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,080
 He had education.

280
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,840
 Think Elon Musk, Bill Gates.

281
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,800
 And he's coming up empty and he's miserable.

282
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,640
 And the craziest thing that we could do tonight

283
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,860
 is walk out those doors and repeat the experiment.

284
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,880
 And begin to look for life apart from God.

285
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,120
 That's what this means.

286
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,420
 You know, under the sun, we learned that two weeks ago

287
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,840
 when Tommy was here, that under the sun means

288
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,000
 that we will try to find life apart from God.

289
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,440
 In the first two chapters of Ecclesiastes,

290
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,800
 he just says all is vanity apart from God.

291
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,520
 And so now we're gonna be in chapter three

292
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,080
 and he's gonna talk about life with God.

293
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,980
 So here we go.

294
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,640
 Chapter three, verse one.

295
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,160
 There is a time for everything

296
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,360
 and a season for every activity under the heavens.

297
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,280
 A time to be born and a time to die.

298
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,840
 So a person's birthday and their funeral.

299
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,760
 A time to plant and a time to uproot.

300
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,840
 And so now not just a person, but with plants,

301
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,440
 a time to plant and a time to uproot that plant.

302
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,260
 And now you're just gonna hear like an array of emotions.

303
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,920
 Good and bad, exciting, not so exciting.

304
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,600
 Fluctuating of emotions.

305
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,360
 A time to kill and a time to heal.

306
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,300
 A time to tear down and a time to build.

307
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,040
 And you're gonna find yourself

308
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,960
 in the midst of these emotions.

309
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,400
 Just think back on your life.

310
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,040
 A time to weep and a time to laugh,

311
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,960
 a time to mourn and a time to dance.

312
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,920
 Anyone?

313
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,800
 A time to scatter stones and a time to gather them.

314
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,840
 A time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing.

315
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,360
 A time to search and a time to give up.

316
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,280
 A time to keep and a time to throw away.

317
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,260
 A time to tear and a time to mend.

318
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,320
 A time to be silent and a time to speak.

319
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,200
 A time to love and a time to hate.

320
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,720
 A time for war and a time for peace.

321
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,680
 First point of tonight I wanna make is just this,

322
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,040
 a time for everything, just like the text said.

323
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,880
 A time for everything.

324
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,400
 This is the human experience

325
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,640
 of every person that ever lives, right?

326
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,420
 Like this is what we experience under the sun,

327
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,480
 which is an appointed time for every kind of experience.

328
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,160
 Solomon is saying, God has the day of our birth

329
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,160
 and the day of our death in his sovereign plan.

330
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,280
 All events happen between our birth and death.

331
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,520
 God is in control of it all.

332
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,880
 And then verse three through eight, he's just saying,

333
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,760
 and he's not just in control of the good times,

334
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,040
 he's in control of the bad times.

335
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,860
 Everyone will mourn and everyone will dance,

336
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,440
 everyone will laugh and everyone will cry.

337
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,880
 And again, everyone will be born and everyone will die.

338
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,460
 He doesn't just avoid the highs,

339
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,560
 but he also shows you the lows,

340
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,080
 or he doesn't just talk about the highs,

341
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,840
 he also shows you the lows of life.

342
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,840
 Like nobody gets to avoid

343
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,200
 the different array of emotions in this text.

344
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,600
 There's pain in this world.

345
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,320
 This isn't the world we had.

346
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,440
 This isn't Genesis one and two,

347
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,640
 where God creates everything and he says it's good

348
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,200
 and he creates everything and he says it's good

349
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,880
 and he does this six times over the course of six days.

350
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,580
 And on the seventh day he rests and it's Adam and it's God

351
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,140
 and everything's harmonious,

352
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,920
 everything's in its perfect place, its rightful place.

353
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,280
 This is Genesis one and two.

354
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,020
 This is not what we had.

355
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,920
 This is now what we have, Genesis three,

356
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,900
 where sin entered into creation

357
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,040
 and it sent creation into chaos.

358
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,360
 And so we see some jacked up things happening in the world.

359
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,360
 All suffering is a result of Genesis three, six,

360
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,280
 the fall of man.

361
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,960
 So if something's not good,

362
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,840
 you can point back to sin, Genesis three, six,

363
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,240
 the fall of man.

364
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,240
 And so we've inherited all of that since that moment.

365
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,480
 And so there's this gap now from the time we were born

366
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,880
 to the time we die and it's called life and life is hard.

367
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,620
 Like I don't think I have to convince you of that tonight.

368
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,200
 And he's saying, hey, paradise lost though,

369
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,560
 will be paradise regained someday.

370
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
 It's not the life that we will have.

371
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,080
 I've read the rest of the book.

372
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,840
 If you haven't, I encourage you to.

373
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,440
 But in the gap there's pain.

374
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,200
 And in the middle, the gap is where we kind of come up

375
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,880
 with some really weird views of God.

376
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,680
 You'll hear TA say a lot, his mentor told him,

377
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,660
 our view of God determines our response to God.

378
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,280
 And so some of us, we have the wrong response to God

379
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,640
 because of our view of God.

380
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,280
 Like some of us might say things like,

381
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,440
 well, if God is good, then he wouldn't blank.

382
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,360
 Or if there's a God that I wouldn't experience, feel this.

383
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,240
 Well, you know, God wouldn't give me the desire

384
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,560
 to get married if he didn't have a spouse for me.

385
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,040
 You know, God wouldn't give me the desire

386
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,320
 to be a millionaire if he wasn't gonna make me a millionaire.

387
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,720
 This, again, name it and claim it theology.

388
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,200
 God wouldn't give me the desire for children

389
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,880
 or the desire for health if he wasn't gonna provide health

390
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,760
 and children for me.

391
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,920
 And so we just have this weird view of who God is

392
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,820
 based on the gap, the suffering, the sin, the pain

393
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,500
 that we all experience.

394
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,100
 The problem with that thinking is that you can have

395
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,560
 a deep, deep need to get married.

396
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,000
 And then you can walk out of this place, get in your car,

397
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,940
 get hit by a car and die.

398
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,440
 And you're like, bro, that just escalated quickly.

399
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,560
 But that's my point, right?

400
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,600
 It's like you could go and that could happen to you.

401
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,600
 And then everything that you thought about God is not true

402
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,100
 because that's wrong thinking.

403
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,200
 Because of suffering, the world is fractured.

404
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,540
 Jesus said it like this in John 16, 33.

405
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,000
 He said, "I have said these things to you

406
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,880
 "that in me you may have peace.

407
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,820
 "In the world you will have tribulation,

408
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,140
 "but take heart, I've overcome the world."

409
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,440
 So even in this verse, Jesus is saying,

410
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,480
 hey, you're gonna have peace in me,

411
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,940
 but in the world you're gonna have tribulation.

412
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,760
 So it's just this time for everything.

413
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,420
 You're gonna have both peace and tribulation,

414
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:22,420
 peace and testing, peace and pain, peace and suffering.

415
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,480
 But take heart, he's overcome the world.

416
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,480
 We know the story that he wrote

417
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,720
 through the person of Jesus.

418
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,840
 We'll talk about that more

419
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,780
 as we continue to progress this evening.

420
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,600
 Jesus also said this in John 10, 10.

421
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,860
 "The thief comes only to steal, kill and destroy.

422
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,400
 "I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."

423
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,000
 This idea that, hey, there's an adversary out there

424
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,120
 and his job is to steal,

425
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,680
 to take things from you that aren't his,

426
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,820
 kill, ultimately take you out and destroy you,

427
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,080
 to just annihilate you

428
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,740
 so that you can't experience the life

429
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,960
 that Jesus wants you to experience.

430
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,920
 So you can see life is filled with highs and lows,

431
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,920
 ups and downs, and I've learned this

432
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,940
 by just watching how life unfolds.

433
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,700
 Like one of the times I've learned this the most

434
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,580
 was when I watched a couple get married.

435
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,840
 Like they dated and got engaged and got married

436
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,860
 and then pain settled in.

437
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,920
 And this couple happened to be,

438
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,420
 or happens to be my brother-in-law and sister-in-law.

439
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,740
 You see, I coached in my previous life.

440
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,580
 You're like, you were a coach?

441
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,460
 Yeah, I was a coach.

442
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,220
 I coached at James Madison University,

443
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,500
 coached baseball and coached a young man named Alex Foltz.

444
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,460
 And then I was dating a girl you saw up on the screen

445
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,300
 a minute ago, Kathy.

446
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,340
 And I was like, you know, like you got a sister.

447
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,520
 Let me play matchmaker.

448
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,360
 You know what I'm saying?

449
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,940
 I've been known to set some people up in my day.

450
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,940
 And so your boy introduced Alex to Jenny

451
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,180
 and they started dating and it was beautiful.

452
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,020
 Like it was awesome.

453
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,180
 It was, you know, the sparks were flying

454
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,460
 and man, they were progressing.

455
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,580
 And he was playing minor league baseball at the time.

456
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,460
 She was living in New Orleans as a pediatric nurse.

457
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,260
 And you know, they were doing their thing long distance.

458
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,660
 And then he's like, it's time for me to put a ring on it.

459
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,780
 I'm like, all right, let's go, bro.

460
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,220
 And so he puts a ring on it and they get married

461
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,420
 and it's amazing, the highs of life.

462
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,940
 And then all of a sudden, in a matter of two years,

463
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,220
 a little over two years,

464
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,140
 they get some of the most devastating news

465
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,180
 that a person could ever have.

466
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,940
 And I thought to myself, man, what would it be like

467
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,420
 if I just called her this morning?

468
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,620
 You know, the problem with that is she lives

469
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,700
 in a remote place in West Virginia.

470
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,100
 She's a turkey farmer.

471
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,540
 Well, she ain't, her husband is.

472
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,540
 And I was like, I think we could put you on a plane

473
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,020
 and get you down here.

474
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,140
 And so she's here.

475
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,140
 And I want her to give you part of her journey

476
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,820
 as she's experienced the highs and the lows

477
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,860
 of what Solomon is talking about in Ecclesiastes 3.

478
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,780
 Would you welcome to the stage, Jenny Foltz.

479
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,280
 (congregation applauding)

480
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,820
 - Thank you. - Love you, girl.

481
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,100
 - Love you. - Do your thing.

482
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,100
 - Goodness, it's humbling to be here tonight.

483
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,980
 I never would have imagined myself up here

484
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,820
 in front of y'all.

485
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,860
 I've watched remotely online on a farm in West Virginia.

486
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,160
 I've taken some of the classes and courses.

487
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,700
 And so Watermark has been a big gift for me.

488
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,540
 And so to be here tonight is all God.

489
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,860
 And I'm hoping to bring my fish and loaves

490
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,860
 and he multiplies it for his glory.

491
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,020
 And I'm gonna read.

492
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,960
 I'm not gonna be near as animated as Josiah.

493
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,340
 I'm gonna be right here in my box.

494
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,500
 So here we go.

495
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,340
 All right, we all have a story to tell.

496
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,160
 As a follower of Jesus and an adopted child of God,

497
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,100
 the neatest thing about all of our stories

498
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,180
 is they are connected through him.

499
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,600
 Tonight, I am humbled to share a part of my story

500
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,660
 the Lord has faithfully walked me and my husband through.

501
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,100
 A time in my life where God met me

502
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,780
 right where I was in my pain,

503
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,080
 how he pursued my heart and how he changed the meaning

504
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,740
 of what I thought a good life meant.

505
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,300
 At the time, Alex and I had been married

506
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,940
 a little over two and a half years

507
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,780
 and we lived on the family farm.

508
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,020
 This big city girl, big city like he said,

509
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,620
 New Orleans, Dallas, Fort Worth, turned farmer's wife,

510
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,340
 had just had her 30th birthday

511
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,460
 and I was enjoying a nice career as a pediatric nurse.

512
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,020
 We were expecting our first child

513
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,980
 and planning to announce it to our family soon.

514
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,540
 Everything was going smoothly, life was good

515
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,540
 until one day it wasn't, cancer.

516
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,860
 At eight weeks pregnant,

517
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,380
 I was diagnosed with stage three advanced cancer.

518
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,580
 Shocked and disbelief quickly took hold.

519
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,780
 What was happening?

520
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,420
 How was this possible?

521
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,740
 Surely this was a bad dream

522
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,900
 I would wake up from at any moment.

523
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,060
 To give myself the best chance of survival,

524
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,740
 we were advised to have an abortion

525
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,300
 and start treatment right away.

526
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,140
 At that moment, my definition of a fun,

527
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,340
 adventurous and good life was falling apart

528
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,420
 right before my eyes.

529
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,180
 This was the start of a jolting life

530
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,660
 I didn't know I needed.

531
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,780
 A splash of ice cold water to a fate

532
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,060
 that was lukewarm and stagnant at best.

533
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,420
 Alex and I wanted to give our baby a chance to live,

534
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,620
 even if that posed a greater risk to my health.

535
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,220
 In faith, we pursued a customized treatment plan.

536
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,940
 The doctors would perform major abdominal surgery

537
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,180
 to remove the tumor

538
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,740
 and they would place an ileostomy bag

539
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,940
 at nine weeks pregnant.

540
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,780
 It's okay if you don't know what that is.

541
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,140
 We had some really hard days

542
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,280
 full of fear that were almost crippling.

543
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,540
 The what ifs and the unknowns

544
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,780
 were all I could think of at times.

545
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,700
 Moments when Alex had to peel me out from under the covers

546
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,900
 and moments I felt like I would physically be sick

547
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,820
 from the fear.

548
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,460
 And do you know what God was teaching me,

549
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,180
 showing me and asking me?

550
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,060
 Little by little, moment by moment,

551
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,180
 I was confronted with the questions.

552
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,220
 Do you really believe what you say about me?

553
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,060
 Do you remember or even know who I am?

554
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,220
 Will you trust me?

555
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,740
 Perhaps I thought I was immune to what Jesus said

556
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,060
 in John 16, 33, as Josiah mentioned earlier,

557
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,140
 when he said, "In this world, you will have trouble,

558
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,820
 but take heart, I will overcome the world."

559
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,440
 Well, I was definitely surprised and shocked,

560
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,860
 to say the least, by the trouble that had come my way.

561
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,820
 I knew God was making a mistake.

562
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,820
 Just kidding, I know God doesn't make mistakes.

563
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,020
 This wasn't exactly the suffering I was wanting

564
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,580
 or expecting or had in mind for the plan of my life.

565
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,940
 And God, in his kindness, got right down to my level

566
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,140
 and sat with me in my fears, doubts, questions,

567
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,300
 and patiently started to show me who he really was,

568
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,620
 who he is.

569
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,100
 And once the fog cleared,

570
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,940
 I ultimately wanted to be a part of his glory being revealed.

571
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,780
 I was learning and still am learning

572
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,740
 what it means to lose oneself for Christ is actually gain.

573
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,780
 And to be refined by fire is painful.

574
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,460
 Killing your flesh isn't pretty,

575
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,280
 but I was starting to want more of him

576
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,080
 and less of me.

577
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,980
 He was slowly but surely making his scripture

578
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,700
 come alive in my heart.

579
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,100
 And when the fear would start to overcome me,

580
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,900
 and trust me, I have many stories

581
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,100
 of the battles against fear,

582
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,300
 he would remind me with his scripture,

583
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,700
 like this one from Isaiah 41 10.

584
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,140
 "Fear not, for I am with you.

585
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,900
 Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.

586
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,420
 I will strengthen and I will help you.

587
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,180
 I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."

588
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,760
 I remember when I was getting my hour long MRI,

589
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,720
 how scared I was.

590
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,000
 And during that hour,

591
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,420
 I felt the Holy Spirit whisper in Jenny language,

592
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,400
 "I've got you, you are okay."

593
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,780
 What I learned and what I want you to understand

594
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,760
 this evening is that he wasn't telling me

595
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,840
 everything was going to be easy.

596
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,960
 He wasn't telling me that I didn't have cancer.

597
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,100
 He wasn't telling me everything was going to be fine

598
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,360
 in my shallow earthly standards.

599
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,520
 He was saying, "Trust me, Jenny.

600
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,680
 Trust me no matter what.

601
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,840
 Whether you die of cancer in six months

602
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,200
 or live to a ripe old age of 100,

603
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,280
 you can trust me."

604
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,640
 God was slowly redefining what it meant

605
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,480
 to have a good life.

606
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,880
 He was transforming my heart

607
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,860
 and teaching me to stand on his promises,

608
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,600
 like in Isaiah 43, where he says,

609
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,360
 "I will be with you no matter what.

610
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,540
 I love you.

611
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,240
 You are precious to me.

612
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,640
 Trust me."

613
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,960
 And you can trust him too

614
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,760
 with whatever you are going through.

615
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,880
 The week spent in the hospital after surgery

616
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,040
 was a hard one.

617
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,920
 A week filled with many moments of pain,

618
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,720
 weight loss, nausea, vomiting,

619
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,160
 injured tubes, but also with flowers,

620
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,160
 cards, texts, and phone calls.

621
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,360
 I could name countless ways God uses people

622
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,040
 to encourage us when we needed it most.

623
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,640
 Another sweet gift was the ability

624
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,480
 to see our baby every single day

625
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,480
 through ultrasound due to the high-risk surgery.

626
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
 We were able to see little nubs grow

627
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,840
 into arms and legs right before our eyes,

628
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,080
 having something to celebrate during the trial

629
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,720
 was such a gift from God.

630
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,520
 During those 14 months,

631
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,700
 mom was up helping take care of me and Alex,

632
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,800
 and there were a couple things she said

633
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,100
 that really stuck with me.

634
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,120
 Anytime she would see fear start to take over,

635
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,040
 she would stop, look at me, and say,

636
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,160
 "Jenny, what are you afraid of?

637
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,360
 Tell me."

638
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,280
 And I would respond with, "Well, what if I die,

639
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,320
 and I can't be here with Alex or to raise our baby?"

640
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,960
 And she would look at me and kindly, gracefully say,

641
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,960
 "Okay, well, what if you do?

642
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,000
 Is there anything you can really do about that?

643
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,320
 And do you trust God with Alex and your child

644
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,880
 if that's the plan he has for you?"

645
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,680
 What am I supposed to say to that, mom?

646
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,160
 (laughs)

647
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,480
 But I knew she was right.

648
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,600
 And I didn't really like it, honestly.

649
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,800
 And God knows that.

650
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,640
 He knows our hearts.

651
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,560
 I don't think he asked us to like it.

652
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,760
 He just asked us to continue to walk in trust.

653
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,400
 Over time, if we let him,

654
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,260
 our hearts will change from resistance to gratitude.

655
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,000
 But there's something about naming your fear

656
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,080
 and praying over it.

657
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,480
 It doesn't change your circumstance,

658
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,280
 but it does change your perspective.

659
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,600
 And like I read recently,

660
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,780
 instead of telling your God how big your problem is,

661
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,840
 start telling your problem how big your God is.

662
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,880
 It helps.

663
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,960
 It really does.

664
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,920
 Another mom moment.

665
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,120
 We were all driving in the car together.

666
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,760
 We were having a bad day.

667
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,960
 Don't remember who said it,

668
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,920
 but one of us said,

669
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,160
 "I wish everything would just go back to normal."

670
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,920
 And my sweet mom again said,

671
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,880
 "But do you really?

672
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,640
 Do you really want everything to go back

673
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,500
 to the way it was before?

674
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,300
 If you don't change, then what's the point?

675
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,520
 This would all be a waste if you don't let God use this.

676
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,160
 How will you live differently after this?"

677
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,560
 It was hard to hear, but she was right, again.

678
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,720
 God is really good at turning your ashes

679
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,760
 into something beautiful if you let him.

680
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,760
 After recovering from surgery,

681
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,880
 my second trimester consisted of three months of IV chemo.

682
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,280
 And on February 5th, 2018,

683
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,860
 the miracle we had all been praying for happened.

684
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,360
 We delivered a healthy baby boy named Alex Carter Fultz.

685
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,800
 Carter is now five and a half years old.

686
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,740
 Don't worry, he's still very much a wild

687
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,840
 and crazy five-year-old who thinks his weight

688
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,280
 is always best.

689
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,020
 But we love our little wild and crazy boy to pieces.

690
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,240
 And I wish I could tell you that after he was born,

691
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,520
 that I was cancer-free.

692
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,880
 When Carter was two months old,

693
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,840
 my doctor called with the results from a recent scan.

694
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
 I still had cancer in an area that would be hard to remove.

695
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,040
 I would need another surgery, more chemo, and radiation.

696
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,040
 I don't have time to tell you about all these struggles

697
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,200
 during this phase, but I will tell you about one.

698
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,520
 As I'm in my hospital room,

699
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,040
 the doctors come in ecstatic

700
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,000
 about the results of the surgery.

701
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,580
 The surgery was successful,

702
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,280
 but the upcoming treatments of radiation and a surgery

703
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,760
 would likely take away the ability for Alex and I

704
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,840
 to have more children.

705
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,080
 I cannot tell you the heart pain I felt in this moment,

706
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,880
 the torn emotions between the lymph nodes

707
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,520
 successfully being removed and the loss of a dream

708
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,140
 all in one package.

709
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,240
 I remember the surgeon looking at me like it was yesterday

710
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,880
 and saying, "I know how badly you want more children,

711
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,580
 "and I'm so very sorry.

712
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,380
 "You have fought so hard for Carter,

713
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,220
 "and today we have the privilege to fight hard for you."

714
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,500
 This was and still is a really hard part of our journey.

715
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,580
 I remember praying, "Lord, please not this, not this."

716
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,900
 And again, he spoke to me and said,

717
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,660
 "Jenny, do you trust me?"

718
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,820
 Psalm 37, four says, "Delight yourself in the Lord,

719
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,780
 "and he will give you the desires of your heart."

720
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,280
 I learned that verse is not saying, "Seek me,

721
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,940
 "and I will give you all that you desire,"

722
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,700
 but instead, "Seek me, and I will be all that you desire."

723
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,060
 I needed to want him more than I wanted the healing.

724
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,980
 I needed to love him and desire him more than my want

725
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,580
 and desire for more children.

726
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,140
 Now, I also don't have time to tell you

727
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,820
 about the radiation experience either,

728
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,100
 but I will tell you it was tough.

729
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,220
 The weight loss, the burns, the daily IV fluids,

730
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,140
 more nausea and vomiting, a teething baby,

731
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,300
 all the possible lifelong side effects,

732
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,680
 and I could go on and on.

733
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,380
 It was physically, mentally, and emotionally hard,

734
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,180
 and yet, another opportunity to trust the Lord.

735
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:42,020
 On August 16th, 2018, we had our first clear scans.

736
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,140
 On August 22nd, 2018, my port was removed.

737
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,900
 In September 28th, 2018, I would have my third surgery

738
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,060
 to reverse the ileostomy bag.

739
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,700
 All praise, glory, and thanks be to Jesus.

740
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,580
 I am so very grateful for the healing

741
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,340
 and for our son, Carter.

742
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,900
 Those are gifts, but they aren't the prize.

743
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,380
 Jesus is the prize.

744
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,900
 Janet Erickson Stewart said,

745
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,020
 "Joy is not the absent of suffering,

746
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,780
 "but the presence of God."

747
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,220
 My definition of what a good life meant

748
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,480
 would forever be changed.

749
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,940
 The good in life is not earthly, but heavenly,

750
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,200
 and I cannot wait to see Jesus in all of his glory.

751
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,100
 No more tears, no more suffering, no more death.

752
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,300
 I thought I knew that, but with the help of the Holy Spirit,

753
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,100
 he's helping me learn to live it.

754
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,500
 As I tell my story, I know full well that healing

755
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,140
 on this earth is not always a part of everyone's story.

756
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,900
 I had several friends diagnosed alongside of me

757
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,100
 that went to be with Jesus,

758
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,060
 who had young children and husbands as well.

759
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,160
 I can never even come close to trying to explain

760
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,580
 the why behind the suffering we see in this world,

761
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,820
 but I can tell you all about the one, Jesus,

762
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,560
 who walked with me and my husband through it,

763
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,560
 and he is walking with you as well.

764
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,940
 I have a theme verse, 2 Corinthians 4, 16, 18.

765
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,300
 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

766
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,340
 the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,

767
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,220
 who comforts us in all our afflictions

768
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,840
 so that we may be able to comfort those

769
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,900
 who are in any affliction with the comfort

770
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,440
 with which we ourselves are comforted by God.

771
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,180
 Because of what God walked me through

772
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,860
 and how he comforts me, I hope to also be a comfort

773
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,420
 to others during their time of need.

774
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,680
 I'll end with a quote from Elizabeth Elliot.

775
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,360
 The deepest things that I have learned in my own life

776
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,480
 have come from the deepest suffering,

777
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,000
 and out of the deepest waters and the hottest fires

778
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,940
 have come the deepest things that I know about God.

779
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,680
 Because suffering, if we let God work, is never for nothing.

780
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,320
 God hasn't wasted my suffering,

781
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,880
 and he won't waste your suffering

782
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,120
 when you choose to trust him.

783
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,740
 He's not done writing my story,

784
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,920
 and he's not done writing your story.

785
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,600
 You can trust him as well.

786
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,980
 (congregation applauding)

787
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:11,260
 Praise God.

788
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,100
 You might've heard me say as she walked up here,

789
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,320
 I just said, "Hey, you do your thing."

790
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,340
 And that just means, hey, you just make God famous

791
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,640
 in the midst of your pain.

792
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,540
 You just make much of him, and as you continue

793
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,260
 to live with the scars and you live with the story

794
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,420
 that God has given you and that he's continuing

795
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:33,420
 to write for you, and that's what pain is for.

796
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,220
 That's one of the reasons what pain is for,

797
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,980
 is that it grows dependence on God.

798
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,060
 It refines you in a way where all the things

799
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:46,260
 that Solomon tried to pursue in the first two chapters

800
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,260
 are vanity apart from God.

801
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,460
 That's what pain does, is it humanizes you,

802
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,340
 and it shows you that there's something beyond

803
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,500
 the clouds, like the world.

804
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,860
 It's something beyond just what we live and breathe

805
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,660
 and do day in and day out.

806
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:09,020
 There's a God who came ultimately for suffering,

807
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,220
 which we'll talk about here in a little bit.

808
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:17,540
 Ecclesiastes 3, verse nine, Solomon goes on to say,

809
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,420
 "What do workers gain for their toil?"

810
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,180
 Or what does workers gain from their toil, better yet said?

811
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,140
 "What do they profit or what do they show

812
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,660
 "from all their work," is what he's saying.

813
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,580
 He's saying that no matter how good you are at work,

814
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,300
 you will die and you will lose everything.

815
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,180
 Tommy said it like this two weeks ago.

816
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,920
 He just says, "That's why you never see a hearse

817
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,460
 "pulling a U-Haul, because all of that's gonna be gone.

818
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,180
 "You can't take it with you."

819
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:46,700
 Goes on and says in verse 10, "I have seen the burden,"

820
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,100
 another translation says, "I have seen the task.

821
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,580
 "I have seen the burden of the task

822
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,940
 "God has laid on the human race."

823
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,740
 This burden or this task is talking about how life is hard.

824
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,580
 Here in this chapter, like I said earlier,

825
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,100
 he's writing to the believer.

826
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:07,100
 He's writing to the person who has their eyes open to God.

827
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:14,140
 And he's saying these things from a place of,

828
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,960
 hey, their eyes have been open to the truth,

829
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,660
 and so what do you do when life is filled

830
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,300
 with question marks when you sometimes look at the Bible

831
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,820
 and it's just filled with exclamation points?

832
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,660
 Like what do you do when that happens?

833
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,820
 Like what do you do when you find your faith

834
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,980
 that's in a crisis?

835
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,580
 Like why does the Bible and God allow suffering and pain

836
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,060
 if he's good?

837
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:45,300
 The routine checkup that ends up stage three cancer at 30,

838
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,700
 or the person that got on the road

839
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,580
 and got hit by another car and their life is taken,

840
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,720
 or the four-year-old who drowned in the pool to death.

841
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,120
 Like what do you do with those things?

842
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,180
 That's why, you know, if you ever lead someone to Christ,

843
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,020
 you don't just say, "Hey, come to Christ

844
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,020
 "and he'll make everything better."

845
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:09,300
 That's not accurate.

846
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,020
 When we read verses like John 16, 33,

847
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,860
 "In this world you will have tribulation,

848
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,220
 "but take heart, I've overcome the world."

849
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,100
 There's a promise attached to that.

850
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,340
 And so what's our solution?

851
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,180
 Is it deism?

852
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,760
 There's a God, but he's just absent?

853
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,780
 He's kind of on furlough, he's on a break,

854
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:29,180
 he's not really present in people's lives?

855
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,300
 Is it dualism?

856
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,740
 Like, you know, Satan and God,

857
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,460
 they're going back and forth,

858
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,980
 and sometimes God wins and sometimes Satan wins,

859
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,700
 and there's this tennis match,

860
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:44,120
 and they're just kind of going back and forth.

861
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,640
 (pages rustling)

862
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,920
 Satan and God are vying for the throne?

863
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,400
 Oh no.

864
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,680
 God uses Satan and evil to accomplish his purposes

865
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
 in this world.

866
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,160
 And that Satan and evil,

867
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,120
 it's not like Satan and God are here.

868
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,040
 No, it's God, and Satan is below him,

869
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,360
 and Satan has to consult with God

870
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,000
 in everything that he does.

871
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,200
 Have you ever read the book of Job?

872
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,120
 Like, you should read that at some point.

873
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:22,220
 Job, he lost his possessions, his children, and his health.

874
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,740
 That's a book in the Bible.

875
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,280
 Do we understand all things?

876
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,740
 No, we don't understand all things,

877
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,040
 but we have to believe that God is in control of all things.

878
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,420
 Like, if I were to go home tonight,

879
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,020
 and I find out that my house was burned down,

880
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,760
 and my wife is dead, and my three kids are dead,

881
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,680
 don't just tell me accidents happen.

882
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,240
 That's not gonna be enough.

883
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,180
 Like, I gotta know that God is in control.

884
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,080
 If I go to the doctor, and he gives me the results,

885
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,840
 and I have two weeks to live,

886
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,360
 like, it's not gonna be enough for you to say,

887
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,880
 "God's not God."

888
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,920
 I have to know that God is in control,

889
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,360
 and he's made a way for life after death.

890
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,960
 If I don't believe that, then I run to the bottle to cope.

891
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,140
 I run to a drug.

892
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,920
 I run to an illegitimate relationship.

893
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,960
 I run to the party.

894
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,880
 I run to the things that are going to numb me.

895
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,680
 Like, it's not gonna be helpful.

896
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,820
 Accidents happen?

897
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,480
 That's not helpful.

898
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,300
 God's in control, even if we can't explain everything,

899
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,720
 because he's made a way

900
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,880
 for you and I to be reconciled with him.

901
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:40,400
 How many of you, in the last five years, if you're honest,

902
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,860
 you've experienced pain

903
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:46,180
 that you can't really make sense of?

904
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,420
 Just a show of hands, how many of you?

905
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,940
 In the last five years?

906
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,580
 Wow.

907
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,900
 Like, just hold them up a little higher.

908
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,380
 Do you see this?

909
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,940
 All right, you can put them down.

910
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,780
 Like, do you see the hands are in the air?

911
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:05,780
 Like, how do we make sense in the midst of pain?

912
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:12,200
 James 1 says this half-brother of Jesus,

913
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,040
 I think he's got some pretty good advice.

914
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,780
 Verse 2, he says, "Consider it pure joy,

915
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,780
 "my brothers and sisters,

916
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,540
 "whenever you face trials of many kind."

917
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,160
 I love it when it says when, not if, right?

918
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,320
 That's important.

919
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,600
 "Because you know that the testing of your faith

920
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,380
 "produces perseverance,

921
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,960
 "so let perseverance finish its work

922
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,140
 "so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing."

923
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,420
 God wants to get you and I to a place

924
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,180
 where he is the end goal.

925
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,620
 Nothing else.

926
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,060
 Like, when I was at 30, wondering, like,

927
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,340
 "God, do you have someone for me?"

928
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,420
 He's like, "Wait, wait, am I enough, Josiah?

929
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,540
 "If I don't, if I don't have a spouse for you,

930
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,020
 "am I enough?"

931
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,900
 And I remember just laying in bed at night,

932
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,300
 just, I mean, I'm not ashamed.

933
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,940
 I mean, the scripture says,

934
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,900
 "Time for everything."

935
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,740
 I was crying.

936
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,780
 I mean, I was trying to, I was a youth pastor,

937
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,540
 trying to follow Jesus.

938
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,500
 And just like, "Did you forget about me, God?"

939
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,820
 I mean, he's trying to get us to a point

940
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,540
 where he's the end.

941
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,180
 Because if he's not at the end,

942
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,420
 then when you do get married,

943
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,620
 you're going to make that spouse your savior

944
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,400
 and spouses make miserable saviors.

945
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,300
 That's a whole nother message.

946
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,700
 Let me get back to the text.

947
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,740
 Sorry, T.A., man, I can just go on a rant,

948
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,140
 but I'll get back, I'll get back.

949
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,780
 What about the story of Joseph?

950
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,700
 Like, you know the story of Joseph,

951
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,940
 like thrown into a pit, sold into slavery

952
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,580
 by his own brothers.

953
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,860
 And then he gets caught up in this sex scandal.

954
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,700
 Yeah, that's in our Bible.

955
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,060
 He gets caught up in a sex scandal,

956
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,780
 accused wrongly, and gets thrown in prison.

957
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,460
 But then slowly but surely,

958
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,900
 he begins to rebuild trust and become second in command.

959
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,020
 And this is what he says in verse 20 of Genesis 50.

960
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,280
 "As for you, you meant evil against me,

961
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,180
 "but God meant it for good."

962
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,420
 Crazy, man.

963
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,580
 I think Jenny could say that tonight.

964
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,180
 What, you know, the cancer looks like evil,

965
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,540
 man, God meant it for good.

966
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,140
 We can see that.

967
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,580
 She can't answer every question of why things happen,

968
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,700
 but slowly but surely, God's starting to make sense of it.

969
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,600
 And she's being used by God to share her story.

970
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,700
 This is why Solomon says in verse 11,

971
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,180
 getting back to the text in Ecclesiastes 3,

972
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:33,100
 he just says, "He, God, has made everything beautiful

973
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,380
 "in its time," which is point number two,

974
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,300
 and I'm gonna move fast.

975
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,140
 He makes everything beautiful in its time.

976
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,140
 And this is where I get the truth.

977
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,620
 If it ain't good, God ain't done.

978
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,900
 Or if something's not good in your life,

979
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,740
 then God isn't done.

980
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,260
 It's a verse, we have a verse, it's Romans 8:28,

981
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,320
 that God causes all things to work together for the good.

982
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,900
 This is what it says in Romans 8:28.

983
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,500
 And we know that for those who love God,

984
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,580
 all things, just circle that, all, good and bad,

985
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,020
 things work together for good

986
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,460
 for those who are called according to his purpose.

987
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,580
 I wish I could unpack that more, I don't have time.

988
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,920
 But you should highlight that,

989
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,940
 and you should go back and study that.

990
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,300
 Solomon continues in the second half of verse 11,

991
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,020
 he just says this, "He has also set eternity

992
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,700
 "in the human heart, yet no one can fathom

993
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,780
 "what God has done from beginning to end."

994
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,580
 Like we have a longing to see how God sees,

995
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,180
 yet we can't make sense of it,

996
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,700
 so sometimes it leads to frustration and disappointments.

997
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:37,020
 And we have to sometimes just live in that,

998
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,260
 and it builds trust, it allows that faith muscle

999
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:44,300
 to get stronger and stronger and stronger.

1000
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:48,900
 And God begins to reveal how he wants you to use that pain,

1001
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,660
 that suffering, like he has in Jenny's life.

1002
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,780
 We have this eternal void, verse 11 says,

1003
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,260
 that nothing under the sun can fill it.

1004
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,620
 Like you can leave here and you can go fill it

1005
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,620
 with your hypoallergenic Labradoodle or your Maltese,

1006
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,620
 but it's not gonna fill it, right?

1007
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,260
 Like you can run to your job,

1008
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,060
 and you can try to climb the ladder of corporate success,

1009
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:17,340
 and get that corner office, and that raise,

1010
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,540
 and make six figures, or be a millionaire

1011
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,640
 by the time you're 30 or 35, but it ain't gonna fill it.

1012
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,000
 You can stuff the Tesla in there,

1013
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 you can stuff the house within that certain zip code,

1014
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 you can stuff that Instagram reel

1015
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,840
 that you made over the 4th of July,

1016
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,520
 that you got people getting likes on,

1017
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,600
 and all of your influence, and it's not going to fill it.

1018
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:44,040
 Like that's what Solomon is getting at in verse 11.

1019
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:49,640
 Like he's on this trajectory where he's tried everything,

1020
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,560
 and all it's doing is leaving him more and more thirsty.

1021
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:58,640
 It's kind of like saltwater.

1022
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,480
 Do you know anything about saltwater?

1023
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,400
 Like saltwater, like if you're stranded at the sea,

1024
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,400
 and you get thirsty, and you begin to drink saltwater,

1025
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,180
 like it's not gonna go well for you,

1026
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,860
 because the point of saltwater is that the more you drink,

1027
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,640
 the more thirsty you're gonna become.

1028
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,920
 And the world, you're traveling through life,

1029
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,920
 and the world is offering you saltwater.

1030
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,360
 And the more you drink it,

1031
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,920
 the more thirsty you are gonna become.

1032
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,240
 Like so many of us, we come into this place thinking,

1033
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,520
 yeah, I'm gonna be satisfied if I just get that,

1034
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,060
 you fill in the blank.

1035
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:40,000
 And Solomon is saying that you're just drinking saltwater,

1036
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,080
 that nothing in this world will satisfy your thirst,

1037
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,020
 but only leave you more and more thirsty.

1038
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,240
 He said eternity in every human heart.

1039
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,720
 I'll close with this.

1040
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:03,440
 What else, another thing that helps me

1041
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,160
 deal with suffering in this life, the pain.

1042
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,980
 I don't even have time to go into it,

1043
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,500
 but whether it's a phone call that I got

1044
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:17,340
 when I was in my 20s from a good friend of mine

1045
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,140
 that we roomed together with,

1046
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,340
 this guy was my roommate,

1047
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,100
 and he was calling about our roommate,

1048
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,940
 and he was calling to tell me that he got,

1049
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:29,080
 that his plane went down, he had a tragic plane accident,

1050
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,780
 and our roommate died.

1051
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,240
 I don't know what your suffering is,

1052
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,760
 I don't know what your tragedy is,

1053
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,340
 I don't know what that thing is,

1054
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,060
 I don't know what you've walked through in life,

1055
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:44,020
 but the gospel that helps me deal with the evil

1056
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,960
 that's in this world, the suffering,

1057
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,580
 the pain that we go through.

1058
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,180
 Like the greatest act of injustice, think about it,

1059
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,580
 that has ever took place, happened 2,000 years ago,

1060
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,740
 the only perfect person to ever live,

1061
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,940
 a divine man was rejected, betrayed,

1062
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,980
 denied, tortured, put on a cross.

1063
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,300
 He and all the people surrounded him,

1064
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,500
 he didn't do anything to deserve that,

1065
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,340
 and he died for your sin and my sin.

1066
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:14,100
 Jesus, the one person who was perfectly righteous,

1067
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,660
 he was without sin, was nailed to a tree

1068
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,820
 for every injustice in this world,

1069
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,660
 for every sin in this world,

1070
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,760
 for every wrong under the sun.

1071
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,260
 He got tortured, nailed to the cross,

1072
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,580
 suffocated to death,

1073
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,460
 and what good could possibly come out of that?

1074
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,020
 Yet God, he turned the most evil thing

1075
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,100
 that ever happened under the sun into good

1076
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,580
 because three days later,

1077
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,380
 the scripture says in history records

1078
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,340
 that he rose again from the dead

1079
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,380
 to defeat that sin and that suffering

1080
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,700
 that you and I go through.

1081
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,300
 And he hasn't eradicated it completely,

1082
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,700
 there's purpose in the pain,

1083
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,300
 he never erased any of it,

1084
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,860
 but there's coming a day

1085
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,220
 when he's gonna make every wrong right,

1086
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,740
 no injustice will go without pay,

1087
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,260
 you can either have that being paid for by him

1088
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,860
 or it would be paid for in hell, the scripture says.

1089
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:12,700
 And I look at everything that God's done,

1090
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:17,220
 how he's reconciled us to him as our creator,

1091
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,900
 and now if God can do that,

1092
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:22,220
 can he not take your situations and turn them for good?

1093
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:26,540
 And he's coming back.

1094
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:31,060
 Revelation 21, I'll end with this,

1095
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,020
 I read this earlier today and I couldn't stop

1096
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,620
 but just marinate on it and sit on it

1097
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,740
 and just soak this up, this is what it says,

1098
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,460
 then I saw the new heaven and the new earth,

1099
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,460
 this is John getting a glimpse of what's to come

1100
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,260
 for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away

1101
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,980
 and the sea was no more,

1102
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,180
 and I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem,

1103
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,500
 there's gonna be a new heavens and a new earth,

1104
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,340
 you know that?

1105
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,340
 Coming down out of the heaven from God

1106
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,180
 prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

1107
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,180
 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,

1108
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:04,660
 behold, the dwelling place of God is with man,

1109
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:08,100
 he will dwell with them and they will be his people

1110
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:12,260
 and God himself will be with them as their God.

1111
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,500
 And don't miss this, verse four,

1112
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,140
 he will wipe away every tear from their eyes

1113
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,060
 and death shall be no more,

1114
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:23,620
 neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore

1115
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,660
 for the former things have passed away.

1116
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:29,300
 And he who is seated on the throne, look at what he says,

1117
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,940
 behold, I'm making all things new.

1118
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,100
 Where's your hope tonight?

1119
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:40,020
 In the midst of pain, in the midst of suffering,

1120
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,120
 even in the midst of highs of life.

1121
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:46,300
 Go back and read the first two chapters of Ecclesiastes.

1122
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,580
 Have you come into this place

1123
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:53,540
 and you haven't gotten to that place of all is vanity?

1124
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,380
 Maybe you're just like,

1125
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,460
 oh, I'm just gonna try the experiment out

1126
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,300
 like Solomon did and I'm telling you, you won't be exempt.

1127
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:03,180
 The worst thing you can do is leave this place

1128
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,500
 and repeat the experiment.

1129
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,300
 Some of us are here and like, you get it, man.

1130
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:13,300
 You're like, yeah, only hope is built on Christ.

1131
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,780
 When the pains of life come,

1132
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:20,980
 I might not be able to articulate the why clearly,

1133
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:25,340
 but I don't live as if all life is an accident.

1134
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,900
 No, I live that there's a God and he's in control

1135
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:33,060
 and he's made a way for every wrong to be made right.

1136
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,300
 And he's gonna wipe away every tear from my eye

1137
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,780
 and death will be no more and pain will be no more.

1138
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,060
 Let me pray that you live with that hope tonight.

1139
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:44,820
 Father God, we come before you

1140
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:47,840
 and we ask that you would move in power and in might,

1141
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:54,620
 that although my words may fail me, you never do.

1142
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:58,740
 And I pray God that your word would be maximized

1143
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,100
 in this place and my words would be minimized.

1144
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:05,900
 That if anyone leaves this place and remembers anything,

1145
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,420
 they would remember you and what your word says.

1146
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:14,140
 God, would you give us the hope

1147
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,060
 that this world cannot give us?

1148
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,380
 And if someone's here tonight, God,

1149
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,420
 and they don't have a relationship with you,

1150
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:25,540
 they've never bended the knee in humility before you,

1151
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,420
 recognize that they're a sinner,

1152
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,380
 separated from a holy, perfect God,

1153
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,380
 but you came and you were the bridge

1154
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:36,300
 by dying on the cross for our sins

1155
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,340
 so that we may be made right with you.

1156
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,020
 And three days later, you rose again from the dead.

1157
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,860
 If they had never truly placed their faith and trust

1158
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:45,020
 in what you've done and they're placing their faith

1159
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:48,940
 and trust in them, God, would they break tonight?

1160
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,860
 And would they, for the first time, follow you?

1161
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:55,140
 And then for my believing friends,

1162
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,660
 that they wouldn't grow weary in well-doing for in due season

1163
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,660
 you tell us we'll reap if we faint not,

1164
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,900
 that we'll continue to trust you

1165
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,000
 no matter the circumstances of life.

1166
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,660
 And you would give us more of you,

1167
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,100
 and that would be enough.

1168
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,820
 We love you and we thank you.

1169
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,380
 It's in Christ's name, amen.
