1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:13,300
 - All right, how's everybody doing tonight?

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,600
 All right, good, good.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,360
 Well, glad to be here, Dallas.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,240
 Say hello to Houston and anybody watching online tonight.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,520
 Those of you guys watching online,

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,000
 just know we have been talking about you

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,920
 behind your back all night.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,860
 I think David even said that we trim the fat

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,760
 with you guys staying at home watching tonight.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,900
 So you can take that up with him.

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,200
 That is David Marvin, David@watermark.org.

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,040
 Any, all that stuff.

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,860
 All right, so I'm Adam.

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,940
 I lead the college ministry here.

16
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,220
 I'm excited to be with you guys tonight

17
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,860
 as we take a little one week break from Romans 8.

18
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,900
 So here's what I wanna start with.

19
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,180
 I wanna ask a question.

20
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,540
 How many of you guys out here in the audience tonight

21
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,020
 like to play cards, card games?

22
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,460
 How many card game players?

23
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,020
 All right, how many play spades?

24
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,460
 Play spades, that's your game of choice.

25
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,500
 Rummy, anybody rummy?

26
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,340
 Poker?

27
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,060
 All right, this is not a Baptist place.

28
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,300
 I love it, all right.

29
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,700
 Got some poker players out there.

30
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,020
 How about hearts?

31
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,260
 Let's feel like that spades like stepbrother,

32
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,100
 whatever, anybody.

33
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,860
 All right, how about a game red dot?

34
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,100
 Nobody, yeah, which is good

35
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,060
 'cause my brother made that game up.

36
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,740
 So it makes sense that none of you guys would play it.

37
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,180
 So I've got a younger brother

38
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,300
 who's about six years younger than me.

39
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,100
 And so he was probably five or six years old

40
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,200
 and he made up this game called red dot.

41
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,500
 And this was the worst game ever made

42
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,460
 because he always won and we never knew the rules.

43
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,580
 Never, ever, and he never knew the rules.

44
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,620
 He was just making it up.

45
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,820
 And so my mom liked to play a lot of solitaire,

46
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,860
 like old school solitaire with cards, not like on the phone.

47
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,580
 So we always had some cards like laying around.

48
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,940
 And so my brother, five, six years old,

49
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,580
 he just picks up these cards and he's like,

50
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,860
 "Hey, who wants to come play red dot?"

51
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,020
 And he'd hand the cards out

52
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,180
 and we didn't know if it was gonna be one card

53
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,020
 or 12 cards or no cards or whatever.

54
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,980
 It always went the same way, him just kind of going, "I win."

55
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,580
 And so I have a younger sister as well.

56
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,620
 So after a while, my sister and I, we wised up to this

57
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,820
 and we were like, "No way, we're not playing red dot anymore."

58
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,580
 And so after a while, my brother would try to get people

59
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,380
 to play red dot and he could not find anybody.

60
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,140
 And the only person he could find was my dad.

61
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,420
 And so I just have these memories of my dad and my brother

62
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,060
 sitting in the kitchen playing red dot

63
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,580
 and my dad just laughing hysterically

64
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,500
 at how the rules would always change.

65
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,460
 And me and my mom and my sister, the wise ones,

66
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,780
 we were over watching TV or doing something else.

67
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,140
 And so I start with that tonight

68
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,780
 because tonight we're gonna talk about a game.

69
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,140
 And this game is similar to red dot.

70
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,740
 And the way that it's similar to red dot

71
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,260
 is this, is it is a game also that nobody else ever wins.

72
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,900
 So this game that we're gonna talk about tonight

73
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,100
 is very similar to red dot.

74
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,780
 And it's a game that if you play it and when you play it,

75
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,940
 there are no winners.

76
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,540
 There's never a winner in this game.

77
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,460
 But this game is different than red dot

78
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,140
 where red dot has only been played by a handful of people.

79
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,020
 The game that we're gonna talk about tonight

80
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,400
 has been played by everyone.

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,380
 Every single person in the room tonight

82
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,580
 has played the game that we're gonna talk about.

83
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,060
 Some of you started playing this game

84
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,220
 really early in your life.

85
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,540
 You maybe started playing it in elementary school.

86
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,260
 You played it with classmates, you played it with friends,

87
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,740
 you played it maybe with some people in your family.

88
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,620
 When you maybe graduated and went on to high school,

89
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,540
 you maybe started playing it a lot in high school.

90
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,020
 Or then if you went to college,

91
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,420
 you started playing it in college.

92
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,580
 Or when you got out of college or if you're working now,

93
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,760
 you got a full-time job,

94
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,020
 you probably played this game with coworkers.

95
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,020
 You play this game with friends.

96
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,300
 You play this game with people that you know in the church,

97
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,180
 people that you know outside of the church.

98
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,740
 In fact, I'm willing to bet

99
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,440
 that a lot of you guys played this game today.

100
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,100
 In fact, I'm willing to go a little bit farther.

101
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,900
 I'm willing to bet that some of you guys,

102
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,840
 many of you in this room,

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,140
 have been playing this game tonight

104
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,420
 since we've been in this room.

105
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:52,140
 And this game that everybody plays, but nobody ever wins,

106
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,280
 this game is comparison.

107
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,740
 Comparison is the game that everybody plays,

108
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,920
 but nobody ever wins.

109
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,700
 There is never any win in comparison.

110
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,080
 My brother is undefeated in Red Dot,

111
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,360
 and comparison is undefeated.

112
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,480
 It always wins.

113
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,240
 Nobody has ever played that game and won.

114
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,160
 And we all do it.

115
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,180
 We all take the circumstances and the situations

116
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,000
 and the things that are going on in our life,

117
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,120
 and we compare it to people around us,

118
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,420
 or we compare it to coworkers,

119
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,040
 or we compare it to people that we know at church,

120
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,360
 or we compare it to our friends that we had growing up,

121
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,760
 or we compare our lives to people in our family.

122
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,000
 We all do this.

123
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,640
 Every single one of us has played this game

124
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,380
 or is playing it right now,

125
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,320
 but nobody has ever, ever, ever won this game.

126
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,840
 We are all losers in this game of comparison.

127
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,240
 And so here's what we're gonna do tonight.

128
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,800
 Tonight, as we take this break,

129
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
 just one week from Romans 8,

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,880
 what we're gonna do is we're gonna look

131
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,800
 at two kings.

132
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,880
 We're gonna look at two kings,

133
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,440
 and one of these kings that we're gonna see

134
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,660
 that we're gonna look at first,

135
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,760
 we're gonna see a reason or a reminder to us

136
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,960
 of what are the consequences

137
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,480
 if you and I continue to play the comparison game.

138
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,200
 If we continue to take the circumstances in our life

139
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,600
 and compare them to other people, where does that end?

140
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,460
 We're gonna be reminded again of what we know

141
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,480
 from experience, that nobody ever wins that game.

142
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,940
 And so one king is gonna remind us

143
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,160
 of the consequences of playing the comparison game.

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,840
 And this king is also gonna remind us

145
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,340
 of why we play this game.

146
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,400
 And then we're gonna look at a second king.

147
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,040
 And the second king that we're gonna look at

148
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,080
 is completely different than this first one.

149
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,280
 And what we're gonna see as we look at the second king

150
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,280
 is we're gonna see a way that you and I,

151
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,720
 like really, really practical ways

152
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,280
 that you and I can avoid playing this game

153
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,000
 so that we don't have to go around

154
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,700
 continuing to play this game

155
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,880
 that absolutely nobody ever wins.

156
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,060
 And so if you got your Bibles tonight,

157
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,080
 let's open up to 1 Samuel 18.

158
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,160
 That's where we're gonna be, 1 Samuel 18.

159
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,320
 And so let me just set up a little bit

160
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,680
 where we're going in this first king.

161
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,480
 So the first king that we're gonna look at

162
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,780
 is this guy named Saul.

163
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,280
 He was actually the first king of the nation of Israel.

164
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,040
 And so we're gonna be in the Old Testament.

165
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,280
 And whenever you hear about the nation of Israel

166
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,480
 in the Old Testament, what that is,

167
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,280
 that's the people of God.

168
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,380
 That's the people of God.

169
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,160
 And so here it is, it's the people of God.

170
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,280
 They've been slaves in Egypt for 400 years,

171
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,920
 and then they were set free by Moses,

172
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,120
 and they went through the Red Sea,

173
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,840
 and they were going into this land

174
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,800
 that God had promised for them.

175
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,400
 And they're starting to settle in this land.

176
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,960
 They're starting to develop as a nation.

177
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,360
 And for years and years and years,

178
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,320
 God had been leading his people.

179
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,720
 And the way he had been leading them

180
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,840
 was he had just been, he had been kind of their king,

181
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,680
 and he was just leading through faithful men.

182
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,760
 And that was his preference.

183
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,440
 That's the way he wanted to continue

184
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,560
 to lead this nation of Israel.

185
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,920
 He wanted to be their king,

186
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,560
 and he just wanted to lead through a faithful man.

187
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,520
 And so here it is, this nation, they're getting established,

188
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,840
 and they're starting to look around

189
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
 at some of the other nations that are around them.

190
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,880
 And they realize these other nations around them

191
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,280
 have a different form of government.

192
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,720
 They have an actual king.

193
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,760
 And so the nation of Israel

194
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,200
 goes to their spiritual leader at the time,

195
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,840
 this guy named Samuel, and they're like, we want a king.

196
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,280
 We wanna be like everybody else.

197
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,400
 And Samuel tries to talk him out of it and go,

198
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,300
 listen, I don't think you wanna be like everybody else.

199
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,760
 I don't think you want a king.

200
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,920
 And they're sitting there going, no, no, no,

201
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,840
 we want a king, we want a king, we want a king.

202
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,920
 And so Samuel finally says, all right, fine,

203
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,880
 I'll go get you a king.

204
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,940
 And so he prays and he seeks the Lord's guidance,

205
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,240
 and God directs him to a man,

206
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,360
 and it's this man named Saul.

207
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,880
 It's really interesting as you read here

208
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,120
 in the early part of 1 Samuel, the description of Saul,

209
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,680
 what it basically says about Saul,

210
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,120
 if you laid your eyes on Saul,

211
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,160
 here's what you would have noticed,

212
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,700
 is that Saul was tall and he was handsome.

213
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,600
 He was tall and handsome,

214
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,540
 like he would have been the perfect bachelor.

215
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,520
 Right, like one of the tall, handsome guys.

216
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,280
 I just imagine a little, maybe a little Italian accent.

217
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,960
 Maybe wear shorts that are a little too short,

218
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,560
 but we'd be like, oh, he's European, you know,

219
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,360
 we'll cut him some break, you know, get him a little slack.

220
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,760
 He's really good looking or whatever.

221
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,680
 And so I imagine maybe, or like,

222
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,300
 he's one of these Disney princes, not princesses.

223
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,400
 He's a prince or whatever.

224
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,260
 Like he's the hero in a Disney movie.

225
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:16,120
 That's the way this king was described.

226
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,280
 And so you would think that tall and handsome,

227
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,960
 that his legacy would have been awesome,

228
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,600
 that he would have started to govern the land

229
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,120
 and he would have been fantastic

230
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,360
 and he would have gone down in history

231
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,000
 of being one of the greatest kings ever.

232
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,480
 And there would have forever been a model

233
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,360
 to say every other leader from here on out

234
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,520
 needs to be tall and needs to be handsome.

235
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,240
 And you would think that that's what his story is,

236
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,140
 that he should be a hero, but that's not his story.

237
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,820
 That's not the legacy that Saul left.

238
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,100
 The legacy that he left was not one of like a Disney hero.

239
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,940
 The legacy he left actually is more like a villain.

240
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,640
 He left this legacy of being somebody

241
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,640
 who was controlled by jealousy, somebody who was envious,

242
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,900
 somebody who was neurotic, narcissistic,

243
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,900
 and really lived a completely miserable life.

244
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,740
 And the reason why that's Saul's legacy

245
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,380
 is because Saul played the game.

246
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,100
 Saul played the comparison game.

247
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,460
 Shortly after he became king,

248
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,540
 there was this other guy that started to come on the scene

249
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,700
 and his name was David.

250
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,940
 And then David did something that was kind of a big deal

251
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,980
 for the nation of Israel,

252
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,060
 that he took down one of their enemies.

253
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,260
 He took down the giant, like he took down Goliath.

254
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,120
 And after he took down Goliath,

255
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,980
 David's notoriety and his fame started to rise

256
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,180
 and all the people of Israel started to say,

257
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,980
 hey, we like that guy.

258
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,980
 We wanna follow after that guy.

259
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,020
 And so Saul made this choice to play the game

260
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,260
 and to forever compare his life to David.

261
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,460
 Let's pick this up in 1 Samuel 18, look at verse six.

262
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,300
 Here's what he says,

263
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,380
 they're coming back after David had killed Goliath.

264
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,580
 And here's what it says.

265
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,140
 "When the men were returning home

266
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,740
 "after David had killed the Philistine,

267
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,500
 "the women came out from all the towns

268
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,500
 "of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing,

269
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,060
 "with joyful songs, with timbrels and lyres.

270
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,900
 "And they danced, or as they danced, here's what they sang.

271
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,740
 "Saul has slayed his thousands

272
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,460
 "and David, his tens of thousands."

273
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,740
 It goes on in verse eight, Saul was very angry.

274
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,660
 This refrain, it displeased him greatly.

275
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,740
 "They have credited David with tens of thousands,

276
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,860
 "he thought, but me with only thousands.

277
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,060
 "What more can he get but the kingdom?"

278
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,300
 And then look at what it says here in verse nine.

279
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,980
 This is him playing the game.

280
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,140
 "From that time on, Saul kept a close eye on David."

281
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,940
 Skip on down to verse 12, look at what he says here.

282
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,920
 "Saul was afraid of David,

283
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,580
 "because the Lord was with David and had departed from Saul.

284
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,760
 "So he sent David away from him

285
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,480
 "and gave him command over a thousand men.

286
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,300
 "And David led the troops in their campaigns."

287
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,580
 You can see what Saul was doing.

288
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,140
 He was comparing himself to David.

289
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,420
 He wanted David dead.

290
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,820
 So here's what I'm gonna do, David.

291
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,140
 You're now gonna lead these armies.

292
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,220
 You're gonna go off into battle,

293
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,100
 hoping that David would die.

294
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,940
 But that's not what happened.

295
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,180
 His fame continued to rise.

296
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,940
 In verse 14, "In everything he did,

297
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,420
 "he had great success because of the Lord was with him.

298
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,820
 "And when Saul saw how successful he was,

299
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,000
 "he was afraid of him.

300
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,120
 "But all of Israel and Judah loved David

301
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,780
 "because he led them in their campaigns."

302
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,360
 And what's so sad is you read the rest of 1 Samuel,

303
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,540
 from chapter 18 all the way to the end in chapter 31,

304
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,900
 it is just this tragic story of a man

305
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,020
 who is just controlled by jealousy

306
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,780
 and playing this comparison game.

307
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,700
 This man who feels like he's constantly falling short

308
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,820
 of this hero.

309
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,420
 And he's just neurotic and he's narcissistic

310
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,780
 and he's mean to David and he tries to kill David.

311
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,240
 And for the rest of that book,

312
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,620
 the legacy that Saul leaves all of us

313
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,640
 is just running after David,

314
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,300
 constantly frustrated by David.

315
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,220
 And then the end of the book,

316
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,260
 Saul dies rather uneventfully on the battlefield

317
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,320
 and his life is over.

318
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,180
 And so we can sit here tonight and we can look at Saul

319
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,040
 and we can cross our arms and we can read,

320
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,940
 go home tonight and read 1 Samuel.

321
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,100
 And we can sit there and pick on him and go,

322
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,620
 I can't believe he did that.

323
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,420
 I don't understand why he would go and do that.

324
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,860
 Doesn't he understand that David was gonna be

325
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,140
 the one that God wanted to lead.

326
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,220
 And we can sit here and we can nitpick all of that.

327
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,100
 But here's what we need to remember about Saul,

328
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,020
 that he stands as a reminder to all of us

329
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,500
 of what happens when we play the game.

330
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,980
 Our lives don't get healthier

331
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,900
 when we constantly play the game of comparison.

332
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,100
 Our lives get to be like Saul.

333
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,040
 But the other thing that Saul can remind us of is this,

334
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,340
 is that the reason you and I,

335
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,300
 the reason we play the comparison game

336
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,120
 is the exact same reason Saul played the comparison game.

337
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,740
 We are no different than Saul.

338
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,080
 The reason Saul played that game

339
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,580
 is the same reason we played that game.

340
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,080
 And the reason we all play that game is simply this,

341
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,140
 we do not trust God.

342
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,980
 That's it.

343
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,060
 I mean, every single one of us has faced

344
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,280
 a very similar situation to what Saul faced.

345
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,460
 I mean, Saul was not being chosen.

346
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,420
 He was not chosen.

347
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,720
 And we've all been through that.

348
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,180
 I mean, as David's fame started to rise,

349
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,780
 people were choosing David.

350
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,820
 They wanted to follow David.

351
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,940
 They wanted to be like him.

352
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,300
 And so they were choosing David

353
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,540
 and not choosing to follow after him or to celebrate him.

354
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,060
 And every single, we've all been through

355
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,060
 something like that.

356
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,340
 We can all think of circumstances in our life,

357
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,620
 whether it started in elementary school,

358
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,640
 at recess with kickball, and you were the last one chosen,

359
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,040
 or it moved on into high school or middle school

360
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,440
 or college with dating,

361
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,020
 you felt like you were never the one chosen

362
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,060
 to go to date functions or never the one chosen.

363
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,100
 Now, maybe today, maybe it went on to applying to colleges

364
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,460
 and you didn't get into the school

365
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,980
 that you wanted to get into, you were not chosen.

366
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,420
 Or maybe there were organizations you wanted to join

367
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,440
 at certain points in your life

368
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,060
 and you were not chosen to join those organizations.

369
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,300
 Maybe you didn't get the job that you wanted,

370
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,220
 or maybe in the job that you're in right now,

371
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,780
 you didn't get the promotion.

372
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,260
 And so every single one of us can identify

373
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,940
 with Saul's situation and go,

374
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,680
 we all have situations in our life

375
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,240
 where we were not chosen and it hurts.

376
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,080
 It hurts.

377
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,840
 I remember for me very specifically,

378
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,800
 one of the times in my life where I was not chosen,

379
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,480
 and there have been a lot, but one that stung.

380
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,960
 And it was in the winter of 1988, I was in eighth grade.

381
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,720
 And it was the winter ball.

382
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,280
 And the winter ball, it was a big deal.

383
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,920
 It was on a Friday night in eighth grade.

384
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,360
 And I just remember everybody went to it.

385
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,920
 And it was not a date function and that was okay.

386
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,100
 Everybody just showed up kind of stag to this thing.

387
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,080
 And that was really good for me in my circumstances

388
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,840
 because three weeks before the winter ball,

389
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,760
 I broke up with Jessica Vollmerhausen.

390
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,800
 So Jessica Vollmerhausen and I,

391
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,440
 we talked a little bit on the phone the summer

392
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,200
 before the class started or before school started.

393
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,040
 You know how that goes.

394
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,400
 You talk to somebody on the phone and you connect

395
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,500
 and you're like, I think I like her.

396
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,800
 And so third day of school,

397
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,360
 I asked Jessica Vollmerhausen to go with me.

398
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,040
 And she said, yes, she chose me.

399
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,020
 And we were like going together in eighth grade.

400
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,380
 And so we did things like we held hands this way,

401
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,240
 walking through the hallways like real lovers do, right?

402
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,960
 Like interlocked fingers.

403
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,000
 And we would hug sometimes, not side hugs

404
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,320
 'cause not following Jesus,

405
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
 full frontal hugs and all that, okay?

406
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,200
 And so we were dating or we were going together.

407
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,520
 I never took her on a date, right?

408
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,760
 So we were going together.

409
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,640
 And then for some reason we broke up.

410
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,520
 And so it was the time for the winter ball.

411
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,900
 And I got all dressed up.

412
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,680
 I got a picture of it.

413
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,760
 You guys wanna see it?

414
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,520
 This is what I looked like that night of the winter ball.

415
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,220
 Is it up?

416
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,540
 (congregation laughing)

417
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:57,600
 Very tall and handsome, very tall.

418
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,780
 There's tight rolled pants there.

419
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,900
 This is 1988.

420
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,820
 It's a gray turtleneck because that's a staple

421
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,180
 in everybody's wardrobe.

422
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,300
 Cardigan.

423
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,600
 Calculator watch.

424
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,180
 (congregation laughing)

425
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,060
 But I had like a smile that was like a 1920s picture

426
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,460
 for some reason, I don't know why.

427
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,220
 Like they never smiled back then and I was upset.

428
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,380
 And so anyway, I show up, I'm looking great.

429
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,220
 I show up to the winter ball.

430
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,740
 And I'm like, man, this is gonna be fun.

431
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,980
 I'm gonna be out there with all my friends.

432
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,820
 And so you know how that goes.

433
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,860
 You walk into the school and you walk through the hallway

434
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,260
 and you go into the multi-purpose room

435
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,340
 that you were just eating lunch in a few hours earlier.

436
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,020
 And those tables that fold in flat with the round seats,

437
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,300
 they're pushed over on the side.

438
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,640
 And so I walk into that room

439
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,320
 and then there's chairs all around and there's music blaring

440
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,880
 but nobody's dancing 'cause Salt-N-Pepa

441
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,000
 hasn't been played yet.

442
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,160
 And we're waiting for George Michael's father figure

443
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,480
 so we could start to slow dance and all that kind of stuff.

444
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,840
 And there's my friends.

445
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,360
 They're all sitting there, nobody's dancing.

446
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,920
 There's my friends.

447
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,380
 And I walk over and there's Jessica.

448
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,200
 She's got her dress on and a little corsage.

449
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,700
 And there's Miles.

450
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,080
 (congregation laughing)

451
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,700
 With his arm around her.

452
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,280
 'Cause now they're going together.

453
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,680
 And like my heart broke

454
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,160
 and I did what any eighth grade boy would do.

455
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,140
 I just went out in the hallway

456
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,880
 and I cried the rest of the night.

457
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,880
 Way more symphony than I deserve on that.

458
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,080
 All right, so I went out there

459
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,920
 and like my heart was broken.

460
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,660
 I was not chosen.

461
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,520
 And it was just the Lord preparing me

462
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,880
 for a lot of heartbreak for the rest of my life.

463
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,000
 But we've all been through situations like that

464
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,560
 where we have not been chosen for something

465
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,240
 and it stings every time.

466
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,280
 And I did what anybody would do.

467
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,880
 You know, as I'm sitting there and I'm trying to think like,

468
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,800
 hey, why did she choose him and not me?

469
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,640
 Was it the hair?

470
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,760
 Is it that I don't skateboard?

471
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,320
 Is it that he plays baseball better?

472
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,160
 Like, what is it?

473
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,520
 And you just start comparing your life to somebody else

474
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,760
 or the one who was chosen.

475
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,860
 And you just start trying to think of all of this stuff

476
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,580
 that you need to change and you just, you lose.

477
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,040
 You play the game and you lose.

478
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,920
 And we've all been through that.

479
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,080
 Saul went through that and that's why we go through it.

480
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,840
 And in that, it's not trusting God.

481
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,400
 So we've been through situations like that

482
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
 where we haven't been chosen.

483
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,600
 And then there's other situations like what Saul was facing

484
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,600
 where we just think maybe something's better out there.

485
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,600
 Like maybe something is better.

486
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,000
 Like maybe that person's better

487
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,400
 and so I need to maybe try to be

488
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,360
 a little bit more like them.

489
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,240
 Or maybe there's something around the corner.

490
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,280
 Or if I dated that person or if I did that job

491
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,900
 or if I had that title or if I went over to that company,

492
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
 then that would be better.

493
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,740
 And you start comparing and getting your eyes

494
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,800
 looking everywhere and it just starts to drive you

495
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,480
 crazy 'cause you just think something

496
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,720
 might be better out there.

497
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,620
 And so you can't enjoy anything that's going on right now.

498
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,160
 I saw a great example of this.

499
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,000
 I've got a seven year old and a five year old little boy.

500
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,320
 And a seven year old boy a couple of weeks ago named Jake.

501
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,140
 It was spring break and got to spend most of a day with him.

502
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,440
 And so we did a couple of things that were fun that day.

503
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,200
 And one of the things we were gonna do at the end of the day

504
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,480
 is I was gonna take him to Target and we were gonna get,

505
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,940
 I was gonna buy him some baseball cards

506
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,960
 and some Pokemon cards 'cause that's what he's into.

507
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,200
 And I was just gonna do it, not because he deserved it.

508
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,560
 And I was just gonna bless him.

509
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,300
 He's my son and I was spending time with him.

510
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,860
 And I just wanted to bless him with something

511
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,160
 that would make him happy.

512
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,080
 And so we're walking into Target and I'm like,

513
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,920
 "Hey Jake, here's the deal.

514
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,960
 "I'll buy you maybe two packs of that or one pack of that.

515
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,900
 "I got about $10 that I'll spend on you.

516
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,740
 "That's what I wanna do."

517
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,560
 And he's like, "Okay."

518
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,920
 And he's like, "All right, so what racks?"

519
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,880
 And he starts looking at that rack and those cards.

520
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,840
 And then he's over there.

521
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,260
 And then his eyes dropped from what I told him

522
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,920
 I would buy him and then it went to the lower shelf.

523
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,760
 And his eyes moved from the $4 packs

524
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,240
 and it started to move to the $25 shiny box.

525
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,280
 He's like, "Hey, can I get this?"

526
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,880
 And I'm like, "No, bud, that's 25 bucks.

527
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,480
 "I wanna spend about 10.

528
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,360
 "Can you get something else?"

529
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,720
 And he sees this other box and he's like,

530
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,640
 "Hey, can I get this?"

531
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,040
 And, "No, man, that one's 35.

532
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,040
 "I wanna bless you.

533
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,800
 "I just wanna spend about 10, okay?"

534
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,680
 And he's going over here and he's like, "How about that?"

535
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,680
 "No, that one's 50."

536
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,240
 Which, that's cardboard.

537
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
 All right, $50.

538
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,680
 And so maybe that and we're back and forth and fine.

539
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,080
 He could not make up his mind.

540
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,200
 He literally could not look at those other cards.

541
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,760
 His eyes were just drawn to the better ones.

542
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,320
 And finally, I just had to get down on one knee

543
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,160
 and I'm looking at him, I'm like,

544
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,000
 "Jake, I think we need to go.

545
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,760
 "I brought you here and I did this

546
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,880
 "and I wanted just to bless you

547
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,440
 "'cause I wanted to give you something.

548
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,200
 "And it seems like you're just,

549
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,880
 "you're so focused on what you're not gonna get

550
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,600
 "that you can't enjoy what I'm willing to freely give you."

551
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,600
 And so he sat there and he took the cards

552
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,760
 and he just kind of begrudgingly,

553
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,160
 we went through the line and I paid for him

554
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,000
 and he opened them up

555
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,400
 and now I'm sure he can't even find them.

556
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,680
 And it just, it completely robbed

557
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,960
 any of that joy that he had.

558
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,200
 He was so focused on the better,

559
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,320
 so focused on that might be better,

560
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,000
 what's in that box might be better,

561
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,720
 that he didn't trust me

562
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,160
 and he couldn't even enjoy any of it.

563
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,520
 And so every single one of us,

564
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,280
 we've been through situations just like Saul.

565
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,240
 We've been through situations in our life

566
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,000
 where we were not chosen for something

567
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,160
 or we've been through situations in our life

568
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,040
 where we think that there's something better out there.

569
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,920
 And guys, when we face those situations,

570
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,360
 we have two choices to make, that's it.

571
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,560
 There's only two things we can do.

572
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,080
 There's not three, not four, not five.

573
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,840
 There are two things we can do.

574
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,560
 Option number one is we can end those situations

575
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,400
 when we're not chosen

576
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,800
 or we think there may be something better.

577
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,960
 Option number one is trust God, trust him.

578
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,560
 And look at these circumstances,

579
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,000
 not as things that we need to fix

580
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,840
 or something that maybe God is trying to hold back from us,

581
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,360
 but look at that and remind ourselves

582
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,240
 of what David says in Psalm 115, verse three,

583
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,800
 that our God is in heaven

584
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,160
 and he does whatever he pleases.

585
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,200
 And remind ourselves of what David's son Solomon

586
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,520
 ultimately said here in Proverbs 16, nine,

587
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,000
 "In their hearts, humans plan their course,

588
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,320
 "but the Lord, the Lord is the one

589
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,640
 "who establishes their steps."

590
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,120
 Remind ourselves of what Paul wrote

591
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,800
 and that you guys studied last week in Romans 8, 28.

592
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,000
 And we know that in all things,

593
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,280
 God works for the good of those who love him

594
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,400
 and who have been called according to his purposes.

595
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,880
 These situations that we face

596
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,640
 where somebody else is being chosen

597
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,800
 or we think there's someone

598
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,600
 or something else out there that's better,

599
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,000
 these are situations where we can trust God.

600
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,840
 That's what we can do.

601
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,040
 We can trust him and just recognize that he's in heaven.

602
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,400
 He's the one controlling all of these circumstances.

603
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,480
 That's one option.

604
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,240
 Well, the other option is play the game.

605
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,080
 That's it.

606
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,600
 Trust him or play the comparison game.

607
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,280
 And if you choose not to trust him in those situations,

608
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,960
 if you choose to play the comparison game,

609
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,320
 and here's what's gonna happen.

610
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,600
 And here's what's gonna happen.

611
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,200
 Things are not gonna get better.

612
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,440
 You're gonna become more controlling.

613
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,520
 You're gonna become more manipulative.

614
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,360
 You're gonna become more discontent.

615
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,400
 You're gonna become filled with jealousy

616
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,440
 and filled with envy.

617
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,640
 You're gonna become more neurotic.

618
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,120
 You're gonna become more narcissistic.

619
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,800
 You're gonna just become this like,

620
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,000
 just totally and completely focused on yourself.

621
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,440
 You'll be miserable and you won't win

622
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,480
 'cause nobody ever, ever, ever wins the comparison game.

623
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,920
 You trust him or you play.

624
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,200
 I mean, here's the fact of the matter, guys.

625
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,600
 If there's ever a time in our life

626
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,240
 where we feel like we're winning,

627
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,080
 where we feel like things are going our way,

628
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,560
 where we feel like, hey, the relationships are going well,

629
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,920
 the job's going well, the bank account's going well,

630
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,120
 I feel like I'm winning right now.

631
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,000
 What we need to remember,

632
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,200
 we need to remember in those situations in life

633
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,040
 when you and I, when we feel like we're winning,

634
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,200
 we generally take a lot more credit

635
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,400
 for those times in our life than we deserve.

636
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,320
 We generally take a lot more credit than we deserve.

637
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,840
 I think again about my brother.

638
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,760
 When I was growing up in Manassas, Virginia

639
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,440
 is where I spent my elementary school years.

640
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,480
 In Manassas, Virginia, one of my favorite restaurants

641
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,120
 or my parents' favorite restaurants

642
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,800
 that we went to all the time was this place called El Taco,

643
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,960
 which is Spanish for the taco.

644
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,160
 (congregation laughing)

645
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,760
 All right, so this was like this one Mexican restaurant

646
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,520
 in Manassas, Virginia,

647
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,840
 nowhere close to being as good as what we have

648
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,920
 up here in North Texas, praise the Lord.

649
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,480
 But this is what we had, all right?

650
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,120
 This is what we had in Manassas, Virginia.

651
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,600
 It was cheap and the kids kind of liked it

652
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,800
 and they were always friends there.

653
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,320
 And so we went to El Taco a lot.

654
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,240
 And so we showed up to El Taco

655
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,200
 and El Taco was in this strip center.

656
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,960
 And so there was no playground there.

657
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,040
 And so my little brother, my little brother,

658
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,080
 we'd walk into El Taco and my parents were like,

659
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,400
 "What do we do with a five-year-old?"

660
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,640
 And so my dad came up with this brilliant idea.

661
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,880
 He knew that there was an original Pac-Man machine

662
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,240
 and we didn't know it was original at that time.

663
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,120
 It was just Pac-Man.

664
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,960
 And so there was a Pac-Man machine right there, video game.

665
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,680
 And my dad would get one of those chairs

666
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,000
 and he would turn it around

667
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,760
 and he'd put it right in front of that Pac-Man machine.

668
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,120
 He'd pick my brother up and he'd say, "Play."

669
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,960
 And he'd walk away,

670
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,560
 would not put a quarter in the machine, all right?

671
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,840
 (congregation laughing)

672
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,160
 Would just tell my brother to play.

673
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,320
 And 'cause my dad, brilliant,

674
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,520
 he knew that like the computer would play

675
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,880
 the simulated game and he knew my brother

676
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,660
 was not at that time very smart.

677
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,280
 And so he would sit there and he'd be like, "Oh, yeah, yeah."

678
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
 And then my dad, he knows,

679
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,840
 eating burritos or whatever and come over

680
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,880
 and he'd be like, "How you doing?"

681
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,480
 "Doing better than last week, keep it up," right?

682
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,880
 And my brother would walk out of there going like,

683
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,560
 "I'm the man, I can play Pac-Man better than anybody."

684
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,800
 He was never playing the game, ever.

685
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,560
 He was taking way more credit

686
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,480
 than he deserved for all of that.

687
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,760
 And isn't that true?

688
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,580
 Isn't that what we do?

689
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,040
 When things in life, when it feels like we're winning,

690
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,440
 when the circumstances are working out,

691
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,640
 we generally, we're not winning.

692
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,360
 Like if those things are going like that,

693
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,320
 that's not, these are not rewards for being awesome.

694
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,600
 These are opportunities to be faithful,

695
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,340
 opportunities to steward.

696
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,880
 What God in His grace and His mercy and His sovereignty,

697
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,760
 as He's in heaven doing whatever He pleases,

698
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,760
 has decided to bring into our life.

699
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,360
 That's what's going on when it feels like we're winning,

700
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,000
 which means the opposite is true.

701
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,400
 If we feel like we're losing,

702
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,380
 if we feel like the circumstances in life

703
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,200
 are not comparing to our friends

704
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,260
 and it's just not adding up

705
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,520
 and we're starting to feel bad and sorry for ourselves,

706
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,600
 we're not losing in those situations.

707
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,440
 Most of the time,

708
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,680
 when those circumstances are not working out,

709
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,040
 we take way more blame on ourselves than we really deserve.

710
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,280
 'Cause here's the deal,

711
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,680
 if we start to compare and we start to think,

712
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,400
 oh, if I just changed the way I look,

713
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,520
 if I just looked this way,

714
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,680
 or if I just got that job,

715
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,640
 or if I just got this money,

716
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,640
 or I could just get into this relationship,

717
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,160
 or if this one would just work out,

718
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,720
 like if all of that stuff changed,

719
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,960
 that's not gonna make us more content.

720
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,520
 Those aren't circumstances that need to be manipulated

721
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,480
 and that need to be changed.

722
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,920
 Those are circumstances where we need to just trust.

723
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,800
 We need to trust.

724
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,320
 So this first King Saul,

725
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,240
 he reminds us that the reason you and I play this game

726
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,440
 that nobody wins

727
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,080
 is the exact same reason he played the game.

728
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,000
 And we play the game because we do not trust God.

729
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,080
 And Saul also stands as this tragic reminder

730
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,760
 of the consequences of playing that game.

731
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
 It does not go well.

732
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,440
 It ends up poorly for all of us

733
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,100
 because there is no win in the game of comparison.

734
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,760
 So let's look at the second King here.

735
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
 Let's look at David.

736
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,400
 So Saul, the end of chapter 31 in 1 Samuel,

737
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,760
 Saul died, David became the king.

738
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,400
 And it's really interesting.

739
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,680
 I mean, Saul's legacy was one of jealousy

740
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,040
 and being neurotic and narcissistic

741
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,640
 and being jealous and running after David.

742
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,760
 So that's Saul's legacy.

743
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,000
 What's really interesting

744
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,680
 is that's like the complete opposite of David's legacy.

745
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,600
 David became king.

746
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,840
 And what is the legacy that we know about David?

747
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,360
 We know that he was one of the greatest

748
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,400
 kings ever for the nation of Israel.

749
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,240
 It's not the greatest king ever for the nation of Israel.

750
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,600
 And the other thing we know about David

751
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,320
 is that his reputation was that he was a man

752
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,000
 after God's own heart.

753
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,280
 We know David was not perfect,

754
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,040
 but we know that even in his imperfection,

755
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,160
 he handled it in a way that still for us today is a model.

756
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,400
 And David left us this amazing gift.

757
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,680
 He left us the Psalms, his writings.

758
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,040
 It's almost like reading his journal,

759
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,800
 reading his innermost thoughts.

760
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,320
 And what you see is you can see

761
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,160
 his innermost thoughts.

762
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,000
 And what you see as you read through David's writings,

763
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,240
 as you read through the Psalms,

764
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,160
 you just get this glimpse into his heart

765
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,960
 and the way that he viewed the world.

766
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,520
 And you just get this sense

767
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,280
 that David had just decided and resolved in his heart

768
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,960
 that he was gonna do whatever he possibly could do

769
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,400
 to make sure that his eyes stayed on God.

770
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,320
 That his heart and his eyes and his affections

771
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,600
 were gonna remain as steadfast as possible on the Lord.

772
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,360
 And because he was so focused on God,

773
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,560
 and growing in his relationship with him and trusting him,

774
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,360
 because he was so focused on him,

775
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,640
 the thought of playing the comparison game

776
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,280
 never even seemed to cross his mind.

777
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:17,320
 So one of these stories is David was chasing after Saul.

778
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,560
 Excuse me, Saul was chasing after David.

779
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,480
 He was trying to kill him and David didn't wanna die.

780
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,440
 And so in 1 Samuel chapter 21,

781
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,040
 David flees where Saul is, flees the geographic area

782
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,560
 and goes to this town where he's a stranger,

783
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,440
 he's a foreigner, it's this town called Gath.

784
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,120
 And he shows up there and he's frustrated and he's upset.

785
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,360
 And he knows that Saul is coming after him.

786
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,040
 And you can imagine like if that was us,

787
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,640
 if somebody was coming after us,

788
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,880
 if we were innocent and somebody was coming after us

789
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,880
 and driving us and we knew that somebody was jealous of us

790
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,120
 and envious of us,

791
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,800
 and we were sitting there in the same situation

792
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,000
 that David was, that we would be sitting there

793
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,840
 and just go, you know what?

794
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,680
 I'm gonna play this game.

795
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,520
 I'm gonna fight.

796
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,640
 If he's gonna compete against me,

797
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,960
 then I'm gonna compete against him.

798
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,040
 If he's gonna come after me, then I'm gonna go after him.

799
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,480
 I'm not gonna let him ruin my life.

800
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,520
 If it's me, that's the way I would react.

801
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,760
 But that's not the way David reacted.

802
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,480
 So David gave us this gift in Psalm 56.

803
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,160
 And in here guys, in here,

804
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,680
 I think David gives us this indication

805
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,240
 like these really, really practical things

806
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,440
 that you and I can do to avoid playing that comparison game.

807
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,000
 So here he is, he's sitting in this town

808
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,840
 where he's a foreigner.

809
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
 He's got somebody coming after me

810
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,680
 and look at what he does here.

811
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,000
 First, Psalm 56, the first thing he does

812
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,880
 is he just confesses reality to God.

813
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,840
 Just confesses reality to God.

814
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
 He says, "God, be merciful."

815
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,080
 Verse one, "Be merciful to me, my God.

816
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,760
 "For my enemies are in hot pursuit.

817
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,920
 "All day long, they press their attack.

818
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,320
 "My adversaries pursue me all day long.

819
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,400
 "In their pride, many are attacking me."

820
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,600
 And so he started off just going,

821
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,880
 listen, God, they're coming after me.

822
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,840
 You know it, but I'm just confessing what reality is.

823
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,840
 My enemies are pressing in on me right now.

824
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,760
 And then skip on down to verse five.

825
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,600
 Look at what he does now.

826
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,200
 Now he just admits the way he feels about that.

827
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,840
 He doesn't hide it, he doesn't suppress it.

828
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,480
 He just says, "Hey, here's the reality, God.

829
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,960
 "I'm kind of afraid of this.

830
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,800
 "I'm not happy about the situation that I'm in right now."

831
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,640
 And so here's verse five.

832
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,600
 "All day long, they twist my words.

833
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,920
 "All their schemes are for my ruin.

834
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,200
 "They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps,

835
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,840
 "hoping to take my life.

836
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,000
 "Because of their wickedness, do not let them escape.

837
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,360
 "In your anger, God, bring the nations down."

838
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,560
 Look at this in verse eight.

839
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,120
 "Record my misery."

840
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,560
 He's just pleading with God.

841
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,440
 God, you know I'm miserable over this, record it.

842
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,800
 Do you see what's going on?

843
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,840
 Record my misery.

844
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,040
 List my tears, Lord, on your scroll.

845
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,440
 Are they not in your record?

846
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,000
 So he confesses reality.

847
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,640
 He just admits what he's feeling with all this,

848
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,680
 but then look at what he does here.

849
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,080
 Now he starts to remind himself of the truth.

850
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,360
 He starts to speak the truth.

851
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,680
 Look at here in verse nine.

852
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,720
 "Then my enemies will turn back when I call for help.

853
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,920
 "By this, I will know that God is for me.

854
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,680
 "By this, I will know that God is for me.

855
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,600
 "In God, whose word I praise.

856
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,080
 "In the Lord, whose word I praise.

857
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,800
 "In God, I trust.

858
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,160
 "And am not afraid."

859
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,240
 And then look at this question.

860
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,400
 Look at how honest, like here's truth.

861
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,160
 What can man do to me?

862
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,680
 He's, God, I'm confessing the situation is not what I like.

863
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,840
 And God, I'm not feeling great about this,

864
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,480
 but God, I trust you.

865
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,680
 What can these guys, what can they do to me?

866
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,880
 And then look at how he wraps this off.

867
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,520
 He doesn't stop there, which is speaking the truth.

868
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,360
 And then he just reminds himself and he's grateful.

869
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
 He's thankful.

870
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,480
 Verse 12.

871
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,000
 "And I am under vows to you, my God,

872
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,680
 "and I will present my thank offerings to you,

873
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,080
 "for you've delivered me from death

874
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,320
 "and my feet from stumbling,

875
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,560
 "that I may walk before God in the light of life."

876
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,640
 And so here's what David has reminded us of,

877
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,200
 is that in those situations,

878
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,400
 in those situations when we are tempted to compare,

879
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,320
 what we need to be able to do is we need to be sure

880
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,560
 that we are casting our eyes on God.

881
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,320
 Casting our eyes on God and confessing the reality

882
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,420
 of what we're feeling,

883
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,720
 admitting what's going on, that we're not okay with it.

884
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,360
 Like emotionally, we're afraid or we're scared

885
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,760
 or we're frustrated by that.

886
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,960
 But then we speak the truth and remind ourself

887
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,720
 of who God is.

888
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,080
 And we're grateful, we're thankful.

889
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,280
 So it's God, hey, God, I did not get that promotion.

890
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,500
 They chose somebody else.

891
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,040
 God, my roommate from college is now having

892
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,120
 their second child and I am still single.

893
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,960
 I'm not okay with that.

894
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,160
 God, it seems like they're the ones always having fun.

895
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,120
 It seems like things are just going better

896
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,080
 for them right now.

897
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,080
 And I just wanna confess this reality to you.

898
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,420
 And I just wanna admit,

899
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,920
 I just wanna admit I'm not okay with it.

900
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,240
 Like this hurts, this stings, this is frustrating.

901
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,480
 I'm afraid.

902
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,400
 I'm afraid I'm never gonna get that promotion.

903
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,000
 I'm afraid that I'm always gonna be

904
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,280
 in this relational situation.

905
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,160
 I'm afraid that there's something wrong with me.

906
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,900
 And that's why other people are always being asked

907
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,920
 to go places and I'm not.

908
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,660
 I'm afraid of all of this.

909
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,300
 But God, I'm gonna remind myself of truth right now.

910
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,700
 I'm gonna remind myself, God, that you're good.

911
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,860
 That when I ask for bread, you don't give a stone.

912
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,860
 That you are a good father and you only know

913
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,820
 how to give good gifts.

914
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,420
 That you are in heaven and I am not.

915
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,740
 And you are in heaven and you are the one

916
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,420
 who does whatever you please.

917
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,940
 And I've got plans in my heart right now,

918
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,620
 but I want you to be the one to direct my steps.

919
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,380
 I wanna be reminded of your truth, Lord.

920
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,740
 And I wanna be thankful.

921
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:51,140
 Thankful that you hear me.

922
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,740
 Thankful that I'm not alone right now.

923
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,580
 And thankful that I can come to you.

924
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,660
 And thankful that I don't have to play that game

925
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,180
 that I'm so tempted to play right now.

926
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,820
 And I know, 'cause I know that's gonna make me miserable.

927
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:08,140
 And so Saul, he stood as this reminder

928
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,020
 of what happens if we play the comparison game.

929
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,220
 And he stood as this reminder to us

930
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,980
 as to why we play that game.

931
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,180
 And David is this reminder to us of how we can avoid it.

932
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,100
 And here's the deal, guys.

933
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,700
 When we are tempted to compare,

934
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,780
 then what we need to do is we need to be very careful

935
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,980
 where we start to stare.

936
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,500
 We need to do whatever we can to cast our eyes on God,

937
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,260
 to stay focused on Him.

938
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,420
 Because if we play that game,

939
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,540
 if our eyes start going down and start focusing

940
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,900
 on all the things that we don't have,

941
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,580
 if we do that, if we play that game, we will not win.

942
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,260
 Nobody ever wins that game.

943
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,860
 And so I'll close with this tonight

944
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,740
 and just talk a little bit about

945
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,620
 how this kind of invades some of my life right now,

946
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,420
 how I can be tempted to compare.

947
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,700
 And I'll talk about a coworker of mine.

948
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,020
 So it's a coworker of mine that I have here at Watermark

949
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,780
 and that you guys all know, and this coworker is JP.

950
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:07,020
 And so if I compare my life to JP,

951
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,500
 there's a lot on the surface that would look like

952
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,220
 things are different between he and I.

953
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,900
 Just kind of personally, between me and JP,

954
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,020
 he's a lot taller, a little better looking,

955
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:24,180
 dresses a little different, better hair product, right?

956
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,220
 Drives a cooler truck, I don't even have a truck, right?

957
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,620
 So there's some personal things there

958
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,180
 that on the surface would look like,

959
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,380
 hey, things are a little bit different.

960
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,540
 They're professionally, professionally in our world,

961
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,180
 you know, as pastors, you kind of sometimes

962
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,620
 will judge success by stages that you can stand on

963
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,500
 and how often you get to put on a microphone

964
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,820
 and the size of the crowd that you get to speak to

965
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,900
 or the size of the ministry that you get to lead.

966
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,180
 And JP leads one of the largest ministries

967
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,860
 here at Watermark on a weekly basis.

968
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,660
 He gets to stand in front of thousands

969
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,900
 and thousands of people.

970
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:05,500
 His inbox is full of people who want his time,

971
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
 want his thoughts, want his counsel.

972
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,180
 There's often requests coming in,

973
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,340
 because people wanna hear JP teach the Bible.

974
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,580
 They wanna be inspired by him as he stewards

975
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,460
 and uses his gifts that God has given him

976
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,420
 to stand on platforms with microphones

977
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,420
 and to encourage and challenge and equip the church.

978
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,420
 And his inbox gets a lot more of those requests

979
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,060
 than I tend to get.

980
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,780
 I lead the college ministry here at Watermark

981
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,220
 and sometimes I get to stand on stage with a microphone,

982
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,180
 but numbers wise, he stands in front of 3,500.

983
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,940
 I stand in front of 70 on a regular basis.

984
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,300
 (congregation laughing)

985
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,140
 And so you would look at all of that

986
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,380
 and you would say, "Hey, you know,

987
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,340
 "it doesn't really seem like it compares."

988
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,100
 And then on top of all of that,

989
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,500
 JP isn't just my coworker, he's actually my boss.

990
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,820
 And then on top of all of that,

991
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,980
 he's five and a half years younger than me.

992
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:04,340
 When I was a freshman in college, he was in eighth grade.

993
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,420
 And people would maybe look at that

994
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,820
 or there would be this temptation

995
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,900
 or the world would just go, "Hey, on the surface, Adam,

996
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,420
 "it looks like he's winning and you're not."

997
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,740
 And there would be this temptation to try to, you know,

998
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,540
 look at his life and compare myself to his life,

999
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,820
 but I don't compare my life to his life.

1000
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,260
 And the number one reason I don't compare my life

1001
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,220
 to his life is because I love that guy.

1002
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,540
 He's been one of the greatest friends that I've had

1003
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,140
 since I've been here on staff.

1004
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,700
 He has been such a help to me and to my family.

1005
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,980
 And he is one of the most amazing bosses

1006
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,140
 that I probably will ever have.

1007
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,340
 I know that guy loves me.

1008
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,860
 I know that he is for me.

1009
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,580
 And I just know the affections that he has for me

1010
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,900
 and I love him.

1011
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,540
 And so I do not want to compare my life to him.

1012
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,780
 So that's one reason why I'm not gonna play that game

1013
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,620
 when it comes to JP.

1014
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,220
 But the other reason I'm not gonna play that game

1015
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,580
 is because he's not winning and I'm not losing.

1016
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,420
 Because you don't win and lose by stages that you stand on

1017
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,860
 or people that are asking for your attention

1018
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,540
 or crowds that you get to speak to.

1019
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,820
 That's not winning or losing.

1020
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,660
 You know what?

1021
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,940
 He and I actually have the exact same job.

1022
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,300
 Every morning he has the exact same job that I have.

1023
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,620
 And the job that he has and the job that I have

1024
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,820
 is the exact same job every single one of us

1025
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,420
 has in this room.

1026
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,140
 And that is to wake up every single morning

1027
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,660
 and be faithful with whatever it is

1028
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,300
 that God has put in front of you.

1029
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,380
 If you wake up every morning and you're faithful

1030
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,980
 with whatever circumstances that God who is in heaven

1031
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,020
 doing what he pleases, whatever relational circumstances,

1032
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,980
 whatever financial circumstances,

1033
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,540
 whatever job circumstances, whatever your title is,

1034
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,660
 if you wake up every single morning

1035
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,740
 and you don't play the comparison game,

1036
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,480
 you just go, Lord, you are in heaven.

1037
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,100
 You do as you please and you are good.

1038
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,340
 And I'm gonna be faithful

1039
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,420
 with what's right here in front of me.

1040
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,860
 You do that, I'm telling you guys, you don't lose.

1041
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,540
 When JP wakes up every morning, he's gotta be faithful.

1042
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,560
 And when I wake up every morning, I've gotta be faithful.

1043
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,180
 We all have things that we need to steward

1044
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,340
 and be faithful with every single day.

1045
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,860
 And when you do that, you don't lose

1046
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,380
 because you don't play the game

1047
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,180
 'cause nobody ever, ever wins that game.

1048
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,540
 And so we trust him.

1049
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:32,020
 We keep our eyes on him.

1050
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:37,380
 We pursue after him and we be faithful.

1051
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,340
 That's how you avoid the game, amen?

1052
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,260
 Amen, let me pray for us.

1053
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:45,700
 God, thank you so much for just your word.

1054
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,580
 Thank you for our friend JP, Lord,

1055
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,220
 just what a blessing he is to all of us in this room.

1056
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,300
 I know I'm not the only coworker on this staff

1057
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,540
 that would just celebrate him and thank you for him

1058
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,700
 and what he does in our life.

1059
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,820
 And I'm just grateful for him, God.

1060
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,540
 I'm grateful, Lord, that for David and his message to us,

1061
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,180
 that we can confess reality,

1062
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,300
 that we can be honest and truthful, Lord,

1063
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,500
 with what we're feeling.

1064
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,140
 But you've given us a lot of truth to speak to ourselves

1065
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,100
 and to share with others.

1066
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,340
 And God, we can be grateful.

1067
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:25,580
 And so here's the deal, God, we don't wanna play the game.

1068
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,740
 We don't wanna compare.

1069
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,640
 We don't wanna be like Saul.

1070
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,820
 We wanna be like David.

1071
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,160
 And we can't do it on our own, Lord.

1072
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,600
 We need you to help us to keep our eyes focused on you.

1073
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,280
 We wanna be grateful for all the amazing things

1074
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,840
 you as our father have given us.

1075
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,960
 We don't wanna start looking around

1076
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,160
 at what you haven't given us

1077
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,600
 and start becoming discontent with that.

1078
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,700
 And we need your help.

1079
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:53,760
 And so God, will you help us to trust you,

1080
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,620
 to keep our eyes on you and to be faithful?

1081
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,480
 And that's what we pray in the name of Jesus, amen.

1082
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,660
 - All of one more truth

1083
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,300
 as we've been talking about this tonight, Ephesians 1.

1084
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,700
 Let's look at what Paul says.

1085
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:11,380
 He reminds us here, he says this, he says,

1086
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:15,420
 "For he," talking about God, "chose us.

1087
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:22,260
 "For God chose us in him before the creation of the world.

1088
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,980
 "Before we were a thought in our parents' mind,

1089
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,040
 "the sovereign God of the universe, he chose us.

1090
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,660
 "He set his affections on us.

1091
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,460
 "And he chose us to be holy and blameless in his sight.

1092
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,080
 "And he did this, he did this in love.

1093
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,800
 "In love, he predestined us for adoption of sonship

1094
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,100
 "through Jesus Christ,

1095
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,700
 "in accordance with the pleasure of his will."

1096
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,840
 So maybe for some of us in here tonight,

1097
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,180
 just what we need to be reminded of as we walk out of here

1098
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,080
 is just remembering,

1099
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:03,960
 just remembering that maybe in our past,

1100
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,040
 we weren't chosen by the guy in high school.

1101
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,500
 We weren't chosen by the girl in college.

1102
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,840
 We weren't chosen by the employer.

1103
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,040
 We still feel like we're not being chosen now.

1104
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,440
 There's all these people that have not chosen us.

1105
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,360
 And may we never forget

1106
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,400
 that the sovereign God of the universe,

1107
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,400
 the creator of all of it, he chose us.

1108
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,820
 And he set his affections on us,

1109
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,980
 and he showed us his love

1110
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,780
 in sending Jesus to die on the cross for us.

1111
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:37,580
 And if we know that, if you're in here and you know that,

1112
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:41,180
 you've placed your faith in Jesus, you walk out of here,

1113
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,300
 never, ever, ever happen to play the comparison game again,

1114
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,660
 because the only one who matters, he chose you,

1115
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,460
 and he loves you.

1116
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,560
 And there's some of you in a room,

1117
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,780
 I'm sure with this many people in the room,

1118
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,660
 that don't know who this Jesus is.

1119
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,920
 You don't know who God is.

1120
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,360
 And if that's you, if you would like to hear more

1121
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,440
 about this God of the universe who chooses people,

1122
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,040
 this God of the universe that sets his affections on people,

1123
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,940
 this God of the universe that sent his son to die

1124
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:12,140
 so that he could be in a relationship with you,

1125
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,820
 we would love to tell you more about that.

1126
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,780
 There'll be some people up here.

1127
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,620
 I'll be up here.

1128
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,500
 David will be up here afterwards.

1129
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,680
 We'd love to talk to you and tell you more

1130
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,140
 about this amazing God that we sing to and that we worship.

1131
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,220
 If you're here and you're just trying to get connected

1132
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,140
 and you want some opportunities maybe to meet

1133
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,540
 some other guys or some other girls,

1134
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,820
 guys, if you wanna meet some other guys,

1135
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,420
 they'll be right out here in the South Community Room.

1136
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,780
 You can meet some other guys and girls right out there

1137
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,900
 in that North Community Room.

1138
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,460
 You can go out there and meet some others.

1139
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,940
 A bunch of people will be hanging out afterwards

1140
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,860
 here tonight as well.

1141
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,560
 We thank you guys for coming and trusting us

1142
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,060
 with some of your time tonight,

1143
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,340
 and we will be back next week.

1144
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,820
 You guys have an awesome week.

1145
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,660
 Take care.
