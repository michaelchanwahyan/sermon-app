1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,800
 - All right, what's up everybody in the room,

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,320
 everybody joining us online.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,200
 We are continuing this series, The Book of Ephesians,

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,840
 and I wanna welcome PortsLive Locations Midland,

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,200
 PortsLive, Boise, Scottsdale, Greater Lafayette, North Houston,

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,400
 Tulsa, all of the different locations joining us

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
 from around the country.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,400
 Let me start by telling you guys about yesterday in my life.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,760
 It was a day that I did not see coming once upon a time,

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,320
 specifically when I was younger, dating my wife,

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,300
 early in marriage, sitting in rooms like this,

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,720
 listening to people long ago,

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,440
 and it was the day when my wife and I went to go

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,060
 purchase a minivan.

16
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:08,400
 And I'm gonna be honest, I didn't see this coming.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,600
 People would sit there and talk about their family

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,920
 and the minivan and we loaded them all up

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,600
 and I would sit there when I'm dating my wife

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,800
 or early in marriage and they would share that

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,920
 and I'd always be like, that's not us, babe,

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,460
 we are not minivan people, we are Tahoe,

23
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,860
 we are Tahoe people.

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
 And then, yeah.

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,240
 (audience laughing)

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,900
 And then the day came and after months and months

27
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,760
 of my wife wanting a minivan more than anything else

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,280
 in the world and you know, just things change,

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,720
 people change, it's very practical,

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,720
 it's a very practical car, we went to go buy a minivan.

31
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,520
 Now long story short, we went there and we got there

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,920
 and we checked it out and it didn't work out

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,120
 and so we are still on the hunt, so to speak.

34
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,800
 But even the fact that we're in the hunt,

35
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,800
 just something I did not see being a part of my story

36
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,880
 sitting here.

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,360
 But while I was at the dealership,

38
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,260
 they needed my license to do some different paperwork

39
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,920
 and so we gave it to them and we looked at the car

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,360
 and it just didn't make sense and we decided,

41
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,440
 hey, we're not gonna buy this one and we took off.

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,360
 I get 30 minutes away from the dealership,

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,000
 headed back to our house and I get a phone call

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,040
 and he says, hey, your driver's license is still here.

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,920
 And so this, you know, long story short,

46
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,520
 just became like, oh, this is such a mess,

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,600
 we just wasted three hours, now I gotta go back

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,960
 and get my driver's license

49
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,720
 and this little piece of identification.

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,000
 Now I say all that to really lead up

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,080
 to the driver's license.

52
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,320
 When you think about a driver's license,

53
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,840
 it is something that doesn't determine or define

54
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,560
 who you are but it describes who you are

55
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,960
 and it describes, in particular, a few things about you.

56
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,560
 It determines who you are, it tells you your name.

57
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,820
 Everybody who's got a driver's license in the room

58
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,660
 has their name on it.

59
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,040
 It tells you where you live, so it tells you who,

60
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,920
 it tells you where, it tells you what year you were born.

61
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,920
 So who, where, what, tells you what height you are

62
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,640
 and when you were born, so who, what, where.

63
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,800
 And tonight, we're gonna look at a passage in scripture

64
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,240
 where the Apostle Paul is going to give us, so to speak,

65
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,240
 another document that defines, or sorry,

66
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,400
 describes who you are, where you will spend eternity.

67
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,600
 When you will change, what you have in Christ,

68
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
 what you need most in this life.

69
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,040
 And he's gonna say, 'cause we're in the series,

70
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,540
 Ephesians, Introducing the New You,

71
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,240
 we're gonna be at Ephesians chapter one,

72
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,720
 and he's gonna lay out the who, what, why, where, and when

73
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,040
 of your new identity in Christ.

74
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,320
 And what I wanna answer as we walk through

75
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,640
 who you are in Christ, what you need most,

76
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,640
 and when you will change, so the who, what, and when,

77
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,840
 is the question of where you will spend eternity

78
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,120
 and why you will spend it there.

79
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,200
 Where you will spend eternity,

80
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,560
 either with God in heaven forever

81
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,560
 or in hell apart from him, and why that will be the case.

82
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,200
 As we look at those three different questions,

83
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,980
 and I can't think of a more important message

84
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,120
 that you can answer, 'cause here's the deal,

85
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,480
 you come every week, or a lot of you guys come every week,

86
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,640
 and people listen online, and we hope that you have,

87
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,600
 man, an amazing career, hope you have an amazing marriage,

88
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,140
 hope that you raise kids that love you and that you love,

89
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,160
 and God just blesses you in every way,

90
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,000
 but not if you don't know Jesus,

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,200
 or not at the expense of you not knowing Jesus

92
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,880
 and spending eternity apart from him in hell.

93
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,560
 In other words, you can listen to our dating messages,

94
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,020
 you can listen to how to fight anxiety,

95
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,220
 but if you don't know Jesus,

96
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,760
 if you're not gonna spend eternity with God,

97
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,120
 that is a waste, and I wanna start tonight,

98
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,360
 and as we journey through this passage,

99
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,280
 give as much clarity to how you can know

100
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,800
 where you will spend eternity

101
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,040
 and why you will spend it there.

102
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,740
 And so we're gonna be at Ephesians chapter one,

103
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,400
 we're looking at who you are in Christ.

104
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,860
 This follower, believer of Jesus, this is who you are.

105
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,100
 Paul's laying out to the church in Ephesus,

106
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,820
 and as a reminder, if you missed last week,

107
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,260
 the letter Ephesians was written to the church in Ephesus,

108
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,420
 young church that Paul loved this city,

109
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,860
 and Ephesus is still a town that exists today,

110
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,900
 you can get on a plane and you can go fly and go see it

111
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,460
 today and go see the beautiful port city that is Ephesus.

112
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,400
 And this, 2,000 years ago, was a place

113
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,040
 that didn't look like it had boats coming through it,

114
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,320
 it didn't look like a port would today,

115
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,260
 but a place that the apostle Paul just loved,

116
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,520
 and so he writes and he launches in and says,

117
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
 "This is who you are, the new reality

118
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,460
 "of who you are in Christ.

119
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,600
 "This is what I'm praying for you,

120
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
 "'cause it's what you need more than anything else,

121
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,000
 "and this is when you will change

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,120
 "and what you have access to in Christ."

123
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,840
 So I'm gonna start in verse three of chapter one,

124
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,280
 it'll be up on the screens.

125
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,560
 If you don't have a Bible, it'll be up there.

126
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,880
 Additionally, if you don't have a Bible,

127
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,500
 we have a Bible for you, we'd love to give you as a gift

128
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,860
 in the Welcome Center right out here.

129
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,860
 So verse three, answering who you are in Christ,

130
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,320
 the first point, and in verses three through 14,

131
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,480
 the apostle Paul gives the longest single run-on sentence

132
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,100
 in the entire Bible.

133
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,420
 I mean, it's literally a single sentence in the Greek.

134
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,060
 It would get butchered in your high school English class

135
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,220
 back in the day, but it's just him overwhelmed.

136
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,660
 It's a little bit like, I don't know,

137
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,540
 like my sister, when she would tell stories,

138
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,380
 she would just go and go and go,

139
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,220
 and she was like, "And today was great,

140
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,060
 "and I was at school."

141
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,020
 And then all of a sudden, Bob came out,

142
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,220
 and Bob was like, "Oh, this is so great."

143
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,300
 And Bob didn't bring his lunch,

144
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,340
 so I was like, "Bob, you can have some of my lunch."

145
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,440
 And all of a sudden, out of nowhere,

146
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,460
 comes Steve, and Steve was like,

147
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,380
 "And you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa."

148
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,140
 And Paul is just caught up in the emotion and passion

149
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,500
 of what God has done in Christ.

150
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,200
 And so he just goes in, starting in verse three.

151
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,660
 I'm gonna try to get through it in a single breath.

152
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,720
 13 verses, here we go.

153
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,260
 All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

154
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,820
 who has blessed you with every spiritual blessing

155
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,660
 in the heavenly realms,

156
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,560
 because we are united with Christ.

157
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,880
 Even before he made the world,

158
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,780
 God loved us and chose us in Christ

159
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,860
 to be holy without fault in his eyes.

160
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,060
 God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family,

161
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,460
 bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ.

162
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,780
 This is what he wanted to do,

163
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,180
 and he gave him great pleasure.

164
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,020
 So we praise God for the glorious grace

165
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,340
 he has poured onto us, who belong to his dear son.

166
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,300
 He is so, oh man, I didn't make it.

167
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,620
 He's so rich in, (audience laughing)

168
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,980
 I feel like I'm rapping or something.

169
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,560
 He's so rich in kindness, his grace,

170
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,980
 that has been purchased, that has purchased our freedom

171
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,260
 with his blood of his son, and he forgave our sins.

172
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,060
 He has showered his kindness on us,

173
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,740
 along with all wisdom and understanding.

174
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,540
 God has now revealed his mysterious plan regarding Christ,

175
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,180
 a plan to fulfill his own good pleasure.

176
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,660
 And this is the plan, at the right time,

177
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,220
 he will bring everything together

178
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,580
 under the authority of Christ,

179
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,980
 everything in heaven and on earth.

180
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,900
 Furthermore, because we are united with Christ,

181
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,100
 we have received an inheritance from God,

182
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,660
 for he chose us in advance,

183
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,900
 and he makes everything work according to his plan.

184
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,660
 God's purpose was that we Jews,

185
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,400
 who were the first to trust in Christ,

186
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,420
 would bring praise and glory to God.

187
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,360
 And now you Gentiles, who have also heard the truth,

188
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,220
 that God saves you, and when you believed in Christ,

189
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,680
 he identified you as his own,

190
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,540
 by giving you the Holy Spirit, whom he promised long ago.

191
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,980
 The Spirit is God's guarantee

192
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:19,120
 that he will give us an inheritance he promised,

193
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,780
 that he has purchased us to be his own people.

194
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,860
 He did this so we would praise and glorify him.

195
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,340
 The first question I wanna answer

196
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,740
 is the Apostle Paul goes through,

197
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,460
 he says, this is who you are.

198
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,540
 When you trusted in Jesus, when you said,

199
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,420
 I'm no longer believing that my good works,

200
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,340
 or myself, will earn eternal life,

201
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,540
 and get me good standing, or get me right with God.

202
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,900
 When you put your faith in Christ

203
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,940
 as the payment for your sin on the cross,

204
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,380
 his death and his resurrection as proof of that payment,

205
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,580
 a few things happened,

206
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,580
 and you receive the fact that you were chosen by God.

207
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,420
 So who are you?

208
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,860
 You are chosen by God.

209
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,540
 And he says, before the foundation of the world,

210
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,900
 God chose you.

211
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,740
 Your father in heaven, and he walks through

212
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,420
 with the father did, the son did, and the spirit did.

213
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,180
 He said, your father in heaven

214
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,400
 chose you before creation ever happened.

215
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,860
 That there has never been a moment you have existed

216
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,560
 where if you are in Christ,

217
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,560
 you were not chosen and loved by God.

218
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,080
 From the very first breath you ever took

219
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,480
 to even before that, he says,

220
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,620
 before anything in creation, God chose you.

221
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,620
 Says that he's blessed us in the heavenly realms,

222
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,700
 as in spiritual, eternal blessings,

223
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,900
 that we won't even fully experience or realize

224
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,340
 until we're in heaven.

225
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,580
 And that he destined us for adoption, that he chose.

226
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,020
 The word adoption, as I've said before,

227
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,260
 and a couple of weeks ago we talked about this,

228
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,980
 wasn't a word that was synonymous

229
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,300
 with what we think of adoption.

230
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,180
 Adoption, in other words, when we think adoption,

231
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,100
 we think, oh, like a child, like a baby.

232
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,400
 In the Roman world, that wasn't what people thought of

233
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,260
 when they thought of adoption.

234
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,820
 They thought of adopting an adult, and here's what I mean.

235
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,500
 In other words, that's pretty bizarre.

236
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,980
 If somebody said in your life,

237
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,220
 hey, we're gonna adopt someone,

238
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,460
 and then the person that they adopted showed up

239
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,260
 and he was a 40-year-old man, you'd go,

240
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,660
 wait a second, what?

241
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,500
 But that's exactly what would happen over and over.

242
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,260
 The most common form of adoption

243
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,340
 was a means by which you would pass on your inheritance

244
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,940
 to someone you selected.

245
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,520
 In other words, the vast majority,

246
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,220
 almost all of the Roman emperors,

247
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,900
 the king of the land, was adopted,

248
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,560
 chosen by the emperor of the time.

249
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,100
 Very few, only three, had any blood relationship

250
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,660
 with the person that came before them.

251
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,020
 So they thought adoption was something

252
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,820
 where you would look and you would select,

253
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,620
 and in that day and age, they would look and they'd select,

254
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,180
 hey, based on certain qualities,

255
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,660
 hey, you fit, and you fit,

256
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,580
 and no, definitely not passing it over to you,

257
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,220
 and they would choose who would be a good fit.

258
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,220
 Paul says, God looked and he knew

259
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,440
 everything you would ever do,

260
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,540
 every sin you'd ever commit,

261
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,460
 everything wrong inside of your heart and your life,

262
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,060
 and despite all of that, he said, I choose you.

263
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,840
 He sees your worst moment,

264
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,480
 and before you ever live that out,

265
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,600
 he sees every sin you're gonna commit in your life,

266
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,520
 sins you don't even know you're gonna do,

267
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,520
 and 2037, on a Thursday, he saw, he sees,

268
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,320
 and he chose you, not because of you, in spite of you,

269
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,440
 just because of his grace, we're gonna see in a second.

270
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,560
 He sees your worst and says, I choose you.

271
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,800
 It's not dissimilar to this, or similar to this.

272
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,880
 In the past decade of doing young adult ministry,

273
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,940
 I've gotten to do a lot of weddings,

274
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,140
 and something really interesting happens in that moment.

275
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,620
 It's a day where the bride will go through

276
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,420
 just hours and hours of renovation process

277
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,420
 in order to get ready for this moment.

278
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,680
 I mean, the guys are out playing golf that morning,

279
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,100
 and then they're like, do I need to shave,

280
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,140
 and then they're getting their suit on,

281
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,420
 and the girls, from Tuesday at four 'til Saturday at four,

282
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,020
 are just going to work.

283
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,500
 They're busting out a tackle box

284
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,340
 full of makeup and painting things,

285
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,980
 tying hair, putting hair that didn't even exist

286
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,860
 before attaching it, eyelashes.

287
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,180
 I mean, they're just going full sin, spray tan,

288
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,660
 in the middle of December,

289
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,440
 looking like they've been on a beach for the last 18 months,

290
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,760
 and they just get so ready, and it's the moment

291
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,360
 where they look better than they've ever looked

292
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,860
 or will ever look in the rest of their life,

293
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,640
 and it's kind of their day.

294
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,840
 And the guy is looking at her in her best moment

295
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,760
 and saying, hey, I choose you.

296
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,700
 See, in the best moment here,

297
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,540
 and he's seeing her and chooses her.

298
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,080
 In other words, I've done weddings,

299
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,580
 and I've never been standing next to the groom,

300
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:35,580
 and doors open, and see the groom go,

301
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,660
 ah, man, I don't know.

302
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,840
 Ah. (audience laughing)

303
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,360
 I feel like whatever renovation happened

304
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,620
 is maybe less likely to choose.

305
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,440
 He's going, man, this is the most beautiful

306
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,660
 I've ever seen her.

307
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,920
 And he's choosing her at her best,

308
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,260
 and the scriptures say that God looked at you and I,

309
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,740
 and he chose us at our worst.

310
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,260
 And he makes the decision, man, I chose you,

311
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,740
 and before the foundation of the world,

312
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,580
 before all of that, in spite of you, I chose you.

313
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,020
 And then he says, the son, and the son purchased us,

314
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,420
 so you are chosen in Christ.

315
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,620
 You have been purchased.

316
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,020
 It's the same word for redeemed.

317
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,860
 What's redeemed?

318
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,740
 Just like if you go redeem a coupon or something,

319
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,140
 you're exchanging it and getting something in return.

320
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,940
 And the message of Christianity is Jesus said,

321
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,780
 I will give my life in return for yours.

322
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,140
 I will take your place and die the death you deserve

323
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,460
 so you can have the standing and relationship with God

324
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,860
 that only I deserve.

325
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,020
 Why did he do this?

326
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,560
 Is it because he knew you're a great person

327
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,620
 or you're not as bad as the other people?

328
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,460
 No.

329
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:41,020
 Completely because of his riches in grace, the verse says.

330
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,500
 That he is rich in grace.

331
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,340
 What's that mean?

332
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,460
 The word grace is the word for undeserved favor.

333
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,220
 That has nothing to do with anything

334
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,180
 that is deserved or merited.

335
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,020
 And God is a God who's rich in grace.

336
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,740
 Grace, I've tried to teach my kids,

337
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,780
 it's not just you don't get punished.

338
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,380
 You were speeding and you should have got a ticket.

339
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,220
 I'm gonna let you go.

340
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,040
 That's mercy.

341
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,700
 Grace is you were speeding and you should have got a ticket

342
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,340
 and I'm gonna give you a new car.

343
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,220
 That's what grace is.

344
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,500
 In fact, I was trying to explain this

345
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,500
 to my six-year-old at the time he was four.

346
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,680
 And I was like, man, this is gonna be

347
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,220
 just a brilliant parenting move.

348
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,340
 And so he had acted up, hit his sister or something,

349
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,020
 you get in a spanking, take him to the back room,

350
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,300
 sit in there and I'm like, hey, do you know what you did?

351
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,740
 And of course, after like five minutes of negotiating

352
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,740
 of no, okay, you hit your sister and you deserve a spanking.

353
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,660
 But you know what you're gonna get?

354
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,220
 A piece of candy.

355
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,100
 And I'm gonna take the spanking.

356
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,820
 And I like hit myself.

357
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,220
 (congregation laughing)

358
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,780
 Which feels a lot less weird when you're not telling it

359
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,220
 to a room of thousand people.

360
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,140
 And ever since that moment, every time he gets in trouble,

361
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,060
 I'm like, you're getting a spanking.

362
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,120
 He's like, I want grace, I want grace, please.

363
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,120
 Spank mommy, spank mommy.

364
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,620
 I'm like, oh man, this message was not delivered.

365
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:13,740
 But that's in essence in a far greater reality, real way,

366
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,900
 he took what we deserved and he gave us

367
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,440
 what we could never ever get on our own.

368
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,700
 And he purchased us and made us adopted into his family.

369
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,180
 And then it says the spirit of God has now sealed you

370
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,660
 or confirmed and guaranteed that God has made a promise

371
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,700
 and that good work he will bring to completion.

372
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,460
 You didn't get yourself in based on how good you were,

373
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,500
 which means you can't get yourself out

374
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,960
 based on how bad you are.

375
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,500
 The spirit has sealed it.

376
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,940
 It's done, sign sealed, it will be delivered

377
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,440
 to God for all of eternity.

378
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,500
 And he uses the language of the spirit.

379
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,700
 He's now sent and begins to come into our life

380
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,740
 and begin to transform us and convict us.

381
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,640
 And it says, it's like the deposit.

382
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,680
 What's a deposit?

383
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,900
 Well, when we were looking to buy that car,

384
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,520
 if I'm gonna buy that car, I put down a down payment

385
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,820
 or a deposit, which says, hey, here's some of it.

386
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,080
 And it's a promise for more to come.

387
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,700
 And the Bible says, man, that spirit inside of you

388
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,780
 is a promise from God sealing you,

389
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,780
 that there is more to come, eternal life to come,

390
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,540
 transformation to come, the new you is beginning

391
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,320
 and it is a guaranteed sure thing.

392
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,320
 And now the spirit is beginning to bring about

393
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,200
 and transform.

394
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,400
 Now, how do you know if you have the spirit?

395
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:46,460
 If you can't think of a time where the spirit of God

396
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:54,500
 and the word of God began to direct your life

397
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,500
 and call you to do something that on your own,

398
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,940
 you wouldn't wanna do, you wouldn't wanna confess that,

399
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,840
 you wouldn't wanna share that,

400
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,380
 you wouldn't wanna be generous like that,

401
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,300
 you wouldn't wanna share your faith at work like that,

402
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,580
 you wouldn't wanna go back and ask for forgiveness

403
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,300
 like that, you wouldn't wanna say, man,

404
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,100
 I think I've messed up in this relationship

405
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,620
 and I have dishonored you and God.

406
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,140
 If you can't think of any moment in your life

407
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,420
 where you decided to do something,

408
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,660
 not because it felt right or you wanted to,

409
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,060
 but because you knew and felt like the spirit

410
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,900
 was convicting you or moving you to,

411
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,300
 then you may not have the spirit of God.

412
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,860
 'Cause the Bible says all who are led by the spirit of God

413
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,460
 are children of God, Romans chapter eight,

414
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,760
 that he begins to come and he doesn't bring perfection

415
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,820
 overnight and none of us are and all of us

416
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,420
 are in need of a savior, but he begins to just bring about

417
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,660
 in our life and things that used to just be,

418
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,500
 man, this is normal and I do whatever I want,

419
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,860
 all of a sudden, it's like he just begins to move in

420
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,740
 and bring transformation.

421
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,820
 Now, the most challenging part of that whole passage

422
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,580
 is like, wait, he just said you chose, God chose me,

423
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,300
 wait, I thought I chose God whenever I trusted in him.

424
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,960
 Did he choose me or did I choose him?

425
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,900
 Yes.

426
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,520
 In other words, this is a tension the Bible presents

427
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,080
 of God wants every person on the planet to know him

428
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,960
 and yet he knows in advance every person

429
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,260
 that will accept him.

430
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,080
 And in a way that none of us will be able

431
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,480
 to fully understand, there is free will

432
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,460
 and yet God is sovereign and he has chosen

433
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,400
 and has known you if you are in Christ

434
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,480
 from the foundation of the world.

435
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,400
 Now, if you're going, wait, but I'm not a believer,

436
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,560
 what about my family, how do I know if he's chosen them?

437
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,740
 You don't, but you know that he has chosen people

438
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,380
 everywhere, which moves us to share the gospel with people

439
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,440
 'cause there are people out there who are going

440
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,900
 to make that decision, they're going to accept Jesus.

441
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,860
 Not a motivation against it, it's a motivation for it.

442
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,280
 And if you're in the room and maybe you're like,

443
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,040
 man, I don't even know where I stand on all this,

444
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,860
 could I suggest that maybe even the fact

445
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,020
 that you're here right now is a reflection

446
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,500
 of the fact that God is after you,

447
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,760
 not to rip you off, but because he's a God who loves you,

448
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,880
 gave his life for you, wants you to experience

449
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,360
 good things inside of life.

450
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,200
 And you're in a church on a Tuesday night at eight o'clock,

451
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,240
 you could be at some happy hour.

452
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,440
 And could it be that God is pursuing you?

453
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,360
 'Cause he wants you to be among those who are chosen.

454
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,600
 So Paul launches in, you can just see the passion,

455
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,480
 I just see Paul just going off 'cause he's so excited

456
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,580
 about what God has done, sealing and giving security

457
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,620
 for the rest of their life, and then he launches

458
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,940
 in verse 15 into a prayer, and in that prayer,

459
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,220
 he asks for something really interesting for them.

460
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,780
 He says, I'm praying for you guys, and here's what he says.

461
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,060
 Ever since I heard of your strong faith in the Lord Jesus

462
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,780
 and your love for God's people everywhere,

463
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,980
 I've not stopped thanking God for you.

464
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,300
 I pray for you constantly, asking God,

465
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,280
 the glorious Father of our Lord Jesus,

466
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,400
 and here's what I'm asking him,

467
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,440
 to give you spiritual wisdom and insight

468
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,720
 so that you might grow in your knowledge of God.

469
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,600
 I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light

470
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,840
 so that you can understand the confident hope

471
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,400
 he's given us to those who he has called,

472
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,760
 his holy people who are his rich and glorious inheritance.

473
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,880
 So Paul launches in, and the first thing that he prays

474
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,540
 is say, I'm praying to God, praying about you guys

475
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,460
 constantly, woken in the morning, thinking about you,

476
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,020
 here's what I prayed.

477
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,040
 Going to bed at night, thinking about you guys,

478
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,100
 here's what I prayed.

479
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,520
 And what he prayed specifically is,

480
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,520
 God, will you give them spiritual wisdom and insight

481
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,140
 so that they might grow in their knowledge of God?

482
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,500
 Now, when you read the Bible, you're like,

483
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,360
 man, that's so poetic and it's so beautiful,

484
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,000
 but it's kind of a funny thing to pray.

485
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,980
 In other words, with everything that got going on in life,

486
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,260
 with all the different ways that life was difficult

487
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,820
 and challenges they were facing,

488
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,260
 why would you choose that, Paul?

489
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,420
 When you think about your life,

490
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,900
 instead of a room like this, you don't pick any one of us,

491
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,620
 and you think about all the different challenges

492
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,940
 that are faced, the job that you didn't get

493
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,620
 or you did get or the boss you don't like

494
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,700
 or the dating relationship that you're not sure

495
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,820
 is gonna make it or even should or is even on the radar,

496
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,940
 and all the different things that are difficult

497
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,880
 in your life, and let's say one of the friends

498
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,900
 around you, tomorrow morning, they send you a text

499
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,020
 and they just said, hey, just want you to know

500
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,620
 I'm praying for you, and I'm praying

501
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,020
 that God would give you spiritual wisdom

502
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,700
 and insight into the knowledge of God.

503
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,660
 You would go, what?

504
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,460
 What does that even mean?

505
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,980
 You'd probably hit the like button,

506
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,300
 and you know, not sure I understand.

507
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,260
 They'd say, I'm not either, just read it this morning

508
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,100
 in Ephesians, what is he saying?

509
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,640
 Well, it's pretty profound, basically he's saying,

510
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,440
 I'm praying that God would give you

511
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,820
 a greater understanding and knowledge of him.

512
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:04,060
 I'm praying that you would know God more.

513
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,400
 The second question I wanna answer

514
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,560
 is something that Paul is asking God for

515
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,880
 'cause he knows that above everything else I could pray,

516
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,480
 the thing that you need, Ephesians,

517
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,840
 and you need, David, and you need, fill in the blank,

518
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,380
 more than anything else in life, is to know God more,

519
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,700
 to know who he is, who you are in light of that,

520
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,460
 what he has promised you in Christ, what you have,

521
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,180
 and he's saying, hey, what do you need most?

522
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,980
 The thing that you and every person out here,

523
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,420
 and you're not gonna think of it this way

524
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,660
 and have probably never even articulated it this way,

525
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,900
 but he's saying, you know what?

526
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,660
 Of all the things I could ask God for,

527
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,740
 the promotion, car, house, prosperity

528
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,600
 and financial blessing in your life,

529
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,700
 marriage, kids, I'm praying that you would know God more

530
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:57,860
 and that you would have a deeper understanding

531
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,460
 of who he is, his love for you,

532
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,300
 his control in the world around you,

533
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:07,020
 and that you would have a death grip

534
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,480
 on the hope you have in heaven.

535
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,880
 The hope we have in Christ,

536
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,180
 and he says the confident hope,

537
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,420
 because he's telling them, no matter what you face in life,

538
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,100
 because you're in Christ, you have a confident hope,

539
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,580
 you know who wins.

540
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,140
 I'm praying that God would allow you to know him more

541
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,460
 and to know the depths of the hope that you have,

542
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,380
 'cause no matter what you face in life,

543
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,500
 no matter if you die in the next four months,

544
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,420
 four minutes, or 40 years,

545
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,300
 you can rest with a confidence you know who wins

546
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,340
 and how this thing ends,

547
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,760
 and you know where you're gonna spend eternity,

548
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,400
 forever and ever and ever,

549
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,520
 and I'm praying that that would become a reality

550
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,920
 in your life, 'cause the more that becomes a reality

551
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,040
 of man, I just know, no matter what I face,

552
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,480
 I know how this ends, I know my God wins,

553
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,240
 it'll change your moments.

554
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,800
 Why do I say that?

555
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,680
 From time to time, I'll record a sports game

556
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,160
 when I'm at like, you know, tonight,

557
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,680
 or I'm out doing something or speaking somewhere,

558
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,120
 and I can't watch in a person, so I do what we all do,

559
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,620
 just record it so that I can go watch it later,

560
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,960
 and I will do my best to go, if it's the Mavs,

561
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,700
 or it's whoever, if I'm around people,

562
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,140
 hey, don't tell me the score, don't tell me the score,

563
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,500
 just wanna go watch the game,

564
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,300
 and I'll show up and just volunteer, hey, good to see you,

565
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,900
 hey, if you've seen the Mavs, Aggies, whatever,

566
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,980
 don't tell me the score, okay?

567
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,700
 Inevitably, though, somebody ends up being like,

568
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,900
 oh my gosh, did you see Luka?

569
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,500
 He just went off in that quarter,

570
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,020
 I cannot believe we're advancing,

571
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,560
 and you're like, ah, so I go watch the game,

572
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,800
 and now I'm watching it in an entirely different way

573
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,240
 'cause I know what happens, and so whatever,

574
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,160
 you know, there's a fumble on the opposite side of the game,

575
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,460
 the team that I want not to win,

576
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,460
 but I know is gonna lose anyways,

577
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,960
 I'm like, it's all right, I know who wins, or girls.

578
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,480
 I've lost everybody with the sports thing,

579
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,920
 imagine The Bachelor, and you know who he picks at the end,

580
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,780
 or the girl, or whichever one,

581
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,060
 and you're like, oh no, they had a fight,

582
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,940
 but I know that he ends up with her,

583
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,780
 so it's all gonna be fine, I mean, it's the exact same thing,

584
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,620
 and Paul is saying, hey, when you know what is coming,

585
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,540
 what's ahead, who wins, it allows you,

586
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,260
 when things don't go how you wish that they would,

587
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:27,260
 to go, I know how this ends, and I have hope,

588
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,500
 and Paul is saying, man, I am praying

589
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,020
 he would deepen his knowledge,

590
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,140
 your understanding of who he is,

591
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,900
 and the hope that you have in Christ.

592
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:43,160
 And that you would know how loved you are.

593
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,000
 Verse 18, he says, he calls the people of God,

594
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 God's holy people, his rich and glorious inheritance.

595
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,680
 Now he just said, God's inheritance is you.

596
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,360
 That's a funny thing.

597
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,600
 Why do I say that?

598
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,120
 Inheritance is something, it's a reward,

599
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,800
 it's something you get, it's something that,

600
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,720
 eventually, you're going to receive.

601
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,000
 And God, who owns and controls everything,

602
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,520
 created everything, everything has been made by and for,

603
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,100
 looked at you, and despite having all of that,

604
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,880
 says, that is my great inheritance.

605
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,240
 I mean, it's like, what do you give Elon Musk,

606
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,840
 or Bill Gates, who own so much,

607
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,320
 and could buy anything for themselves,

608
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,080
 what do you give them at Christmas?

609
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,840
 I mean, truly, it's like, man, you could buy,

610
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,520
 here's some socks, and if you wear them,

611
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,960
 the socks are gonna go through the roof,

612
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,440
 and we'll be quadrillionaires, 'cause they have everything.

613
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,120
 And yet, despite the fact, God,

614
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,160
 there's not a single inch on the planet,

615
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,940
 or in the universe, that is not his.

616
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,920
 Bible just said, man, you are his chosen possession,

617
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,440
 his inheritance.

618
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,040
 That there's never been a moment

619
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,520
 you have not been loved, wanted, chosen by God.

620
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,200
 But the deepest thing is, Paul is saying,

621
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,800
 oh man, I'm praying for you to know that,

622
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,160
 and for you to know him,

623
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,560
 for you to have a deeper understanding of him,

624
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,080
 above anything else he could give you,

625
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,680
 I'm asking him to give you that.

626
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,880
 When 10 years ago this month,

627
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,560
 or a couple months ago, 10 years ago,

628
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,000
 my wife and I got engaged, and whenever you get engaged,

629
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,080
 you get to go through what's called the wedding registry,

630
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,800
 which I've just shared before,

631
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,700
 it's like the greatest thing ever,

632
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,640
 because it's the only time in your life

633
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,160
 you get to go around and pick out a bunch of gifts,

634
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,960
 and then in a way that society accepts,

635
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,200
 send out paperwork to people going,

636
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,720
 hey, we know you're gonna get us gifts,

637
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,480
 if you do, we'd like it to be one of these, okay?

638
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,620
 And so you just go around and you get to register,

639
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,820
 and pick out at Bed, Bath, and Beyond,

640
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,160
 or wherever, Crate and Barrel,

641
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,680
 all the different things you want people to buy you.

642
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,020
 And that's awesome.

643
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,120
 What is a far greater gift in marriage

644
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,900
 than the toaster and the spatula is the spouse?

645
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,760
 And it would be insane for if you were catching up

646
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,400
 with a friend who'd recently gotten married,

647
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,640
 and you were like, man, how is it?

648
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,400
 And they were like, it's unbelievable.

649
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,600
 I gotta show you this toaster.

650
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,960
 We got four lanes here for four pieces of bread,

651
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,000
 and let me show you the spatula over here.

652
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,960
 And you're like, no, but how's marriage?

653
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,080
 I just told you.

654
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,160
 You wanna see the bread?

655
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,560
 You'd be like, well, but how's your wife?

656
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,280
 I actually haven't seen her in a while.

657
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,520
 Let's go back to the spatula.

658
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,280
 You'd be like, you have missed the forest for the trees.

659
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,920
 You are obsessed with the things and the gifts

660
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,640
 that came with it, not the person, the relationship.

661
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,040
 That's essentially what Paul's saying.

662
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,280
 And candidly, the older I get,

663
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,920
 the more that I just walk with Jesus,

664
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,040
 and I see men in my life, and I see women in my life

665
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,640
 who just continue to walk with Jesus,

666
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,400
 this shift begins to happen,

667
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,960
 where it's not that God's against stuff,

668
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,680
 or having a car, or having nice things,

669
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,160
 or having a house, or whatever it is,

670
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,800
 but more than he wants you to know any of that,

671
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,920
 or have any of that, he wants you to know him.

672
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,680
 And more and more, I just see people who,

673
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,880
 man, they may even drive the car,

674
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,280
 they may even have the house, but it's like, man,

675
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,040
 all that's fine,

676
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,600
 but not if it gets in the way of me knowing Jesus.

677
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,900
 I mean, there's plenty of people on the planet

678
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,480
 that have everything that you would want in life,

679
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,840
 but they don't know Jesus, and they're miserable,

680
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,400
 and sadly, they're going to hell if that stays the case.

681
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,520
 And Paul is saying, more than anything else,

682
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,380
 what will endure longer than anything

683
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,920
 that God could bring into your life

684
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,840
 is gonna be a relationship with him,

685
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,400
 and I'm asking that he would give you more of that.

686
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:48,480
 And then he finally answers the question of when we change,

687
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,400
 and it's inside of the prayer,

688
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,840
 and he brings something else up, and here's what he says.

689
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,000
 "I also pray that you will understand

690
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,200
 "the incredible greatness of God's power

691
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,720
 "for us who believe him,

692
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,060
 "the same power that God has towards us and works in us,

693
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:11,280
 "the same power that raised Christ from the dead

694
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,080
 "and seated him in the place of honor

695
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,600
 "at God's right hand in the heavenly realms.

696
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,520
 "And now he's far above any ruler or authority

697
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,000
 "or power or leader or anything else,

698
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,640
 "not only in this world, but in the one to come.

699
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,480
 "God put all things under his authority.

700
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,040
 "He made him head over all things

701
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,480
 "for the sake of the church, and the church is his body.

702
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,520
 "It is made full and complete by Christ

703
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,640
 "who fills all things everywhere with himself."

704
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,960
 That Paul just said, hey, I'm praying

705
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,720
 that you have an understanding

706
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,760
 of the access you have to the power of God in your life.

707
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,320
 The answer to the question of when you will change

708
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,480
 is when the power of God becomes something

709
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,320
 that you begin to surrender to and let work in your life.

710
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,600
 'Cause here's what he just said.

711
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,600
 The same power that raised Christ's dead,

712
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,720
 bleeding, bled out body, and brought life back into it

713
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,040
 is now at work in those of us who believe.

714
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,740
 And he brings up there is resurrection power

715
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,600
 that you and I have access to in Jesus.

716
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,840
 And this is how people change.

717
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,120
 This is how Christians change.

718
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,960
 It's not that they come in and they hear a bunch of rules

719
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,720
 and they're told you need to do something different

720
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
 or you need to act a certain different way

721
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,800
 and they just walk out of here

722
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,960
 and bootstrap and try harder.

723
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,800
 No, the power of God comes into the life

724
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,640
 and begins to transform them

725
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,720
 and do what the resurrection power of God does.

726
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,160
 It takes dead things and brings life into them.

727
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,800
 And there's no greater force or power in existence.

728
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,200
 I mean, you think about God creating the world,

729
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,040
 everything in a moment with a word.

730
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,320
 That's impressive.

731
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,080
 But creation power is creating something from nothing.

732
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,320
 Resurrection power is God creating something alive

733
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,680
 from something dead.

734
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,720
 He doesn't just have the ability

735
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,560
 to make something beautiful out of nothing.

736
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,240
 He has the ability to make something beautiful

737
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,720
 out of something bad.

738
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,240
 And this is where as Christians,

739
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,240
 we have to have an understanding of how you change.

740
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,120
 It's not you deciding on your own.

741
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:19,960
 You know what?

742
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,780
 I can do it.

743
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,080
 I've got what it takes.

744
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,320
 It's by surrendering and walking and accessing.

745
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,680
 I'm dependent on you, God.

746
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,960
 Apart from you, there's no power in my life.

747
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,240
 There's no power in your life.

748
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,440
 You don't have the ability to conquer anxiety.

749
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,960
 You don't have the ability to conquer depression.

750
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,400
 If you did, you would have done it already.

751
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,000
 You think you have a match for lust,

752
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,120
 the pornography you've had for a decade?

753
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,480
 And could it be that maybe you think the problem is,

754
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,160
 man, I just need to try harder and work harder.

755
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,920
 And Paul is saying,

756
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,500
 "There's no power in you all by yourself,

757
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:58,000
 but you have access to the resurrecting power of God

758
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,280
 that takes dead and broken, messed up things,

759
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,160
 and he brings life into them."

760
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,400
 And I wanna answer the question as we close here in a second

761
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,840
 of how you and I do that

762
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,440
 and how Christians experience that change.

763
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
 But it's not by deciding,

764
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,940
 man, I'm just gonna work harder.

765
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,960
 It is by accessing the resurrection.

766
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,280
 This is why people and how people

767
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,760
 begin to experience change.

768
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,720
 This is why people make the decision,

769
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,700
 man, I'm walking in step with the Spirit.

770
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,640
 I'm walking in step with God.

771
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,080
 I need to forgive my father.

772
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,480
 I never thought I could.

773
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,120
 After all the pain, all the hurt, all the abuse,

774
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,660
 and I need to forgive him.

775
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,000
 It's how people, like I've already shared even my own story

776
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,560
 of pornography for years,

777
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,400
 and God, through the Spirit of God and the Word of God

778
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,800
 and people of God moves you to go,

779
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,280
 man, God, I'm totally dependent on you.

780
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,760
 If this is gonna be anything I experience victory in,

781
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,880
 it's gonna be not by my strength or my might,

782
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,320
 but by you and by you alone.

783
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,480
 And so God, I am surrendering.

784
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,120
 I'm walking in step with you, your Word, your people.

785
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,760
 And God begins to bring change.

786
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,280
 And let me answer the question, how does that happen?

787
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,640
 Two weeks ago, I was in California.

788
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,080
 My family went with my wife's family.

789
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,920
 We were on a beach.

790
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,840
 It was amazing.

791
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,680
 It was beautiful.

792
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,680
 And I was up one morning

793
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,780
 and I was watching out in the distance the Pacific Ocean.

794
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,880
 And this sailboat was sailing by.

795
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,200
 And I was watching it.

796
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,720
 And a few minutes later, I went in and just grabbed coffee

797
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,360
 and I came back out and it was completely still.

798
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,880
 This thing that had been moving at a significant pace

799
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,760
 was all of a sudden just stopped in the water.

800
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,360
 And the sail was down.

801
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:45,560
 Sailboat can't move without the sail being up

802
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,360
 and the wind pushing it in a specific direction.

803
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,600
 Apart from that, it is incapable of moving

804
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,560
 in any direction all on its own.

805
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,320
 Or it is entirely at the whim of the waves around it.

806
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,520
 And this is the Christian life.

807
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,320
 The Christian life is that you and I are incapable

808
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,840
 of becoming more and more like Jesus.

809
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,640
 We are incapable of being and living the new you.

810
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,680
 And our role, just like a sailboat, is to spread the sail.

811
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,520
 What does that look like?

812
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,600
 It means, God, I am surrendered to you.

813
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,720
 I am trusting in you.

814
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,360
 I am incapable on my own of having the type

815
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,320
 of dating relationships that you call me to.

816
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,640
 I can't, but you can.

817
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,800
 And so I'm inviting you in.

818
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,880
 God, I am trusting you.

819
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,480
 I am opening my life and saying,

820
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,120
 God, you direct it wherever you will.

821
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,320
 I am surrendered to you.

822
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,440
 And when you begin to do that,

823
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,500
 it's like the spirit of God fills the sail of your soul

824
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,760
 and he begins to direct and he begins to guide.

825
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,160
 But it doesn't happen on your own,

826
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,800
 but it happens in story after story

827
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,760
 of people sitting around you who have experienced

828
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,480
 the power of God in their life.

829
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,200
 The same power that raised Christ from the dead.

830
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,520
 Working in their life and bringing and healing

831
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,080
 all the different places that you think,

832
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,920
 man, that's too far.

833
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,960
 And Paul would say, you have access

834
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,480
 to the most powerful thing that has ever existed.

835
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,600
 And the spirit of God inside of your life.

836
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,200
 And that's when you would change.

837
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,600
 So where will you spend eternity?

838
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,920
 Well, it comes back to the why.

839
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,520
 How do you put your faith and trust in Jesus

840
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,560
 as the payment for your sin?

841
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,700
 'Cause if so, you are chosen, you are forgiven,

842
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,120
 you are sealed, you were purchased.

843
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,880
 And the greatest thing any of us need in this life

844
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,760
 is more of God.

845
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,440
 And the way that we experience change in our life

846
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,120
 is not by trying harder or by doing more things.

847
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,680
 It is by, God, I am dependent and surrendered to you.

848
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,320
 You bring change.

849
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,000
 I'm opening the sail of my life and you direct.

850
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,200
 And I trust you.

851
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,000
 And that person will spend eternity with God in heaven,

852
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,440
 not because of anything they've done,

853
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,440
 but because of Christ, because they are the new creation.

854
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,600
 And that same extension is offered by God to you tonight.

855
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,040
 And just the last thing I would say,

856
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,320
 man, if you've never made that decision,

857
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,040
 tonight is your night.

858
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,800
 And God, he's not angry at you, he's crazy about you.

859
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,000
 He gave his life for you

860
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 so that you could experience a new life in him.

861
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,000
 Let me pray.

862
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Father, I thank you that you are at work in our lives.

863
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,040
 I thank you for the ways you are bringing resurrection power

864
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,960
 and taking areas of our soul and our life and ourself

865
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,040
 that are dead and you're bringing life.

866
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,540
 And so would you help us, God, to be surrendered,

867
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,040
 to be open to you, to be led by you,

868
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,240
 to walk just dependent on you.

869
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,520
 God, we can't change ourself.

870
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,080
 We can't conquer anything,

871
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,520
 but you can conquer everything.

872
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,760
 And so God, we ask for your help

873
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,480
 to walk in dependence on you.

874
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,960
 I pray for anyone who has never trusted in you tonight

875
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,200
 that would change.

876
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,280
 And in their heart and where they're sitting

877
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,160
 or in the moments that we're having ahead,

878
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,000
 that they would come to a place

879
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,200
 where they realize and accept that

880
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,120
 they are chosen.

881
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,960
 They are loved.

882
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,040
 They have been purchased by Jesus's life

883
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,240
 and they are sealed.

884
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,200
 And that is a deposit of what is to come.

885
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,280
 We worship you now in song.

886
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,120
 Amen.

887
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,120
 We worship you now in song. Amen.
