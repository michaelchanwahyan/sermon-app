[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:25.160]   >> Dude, that is amazing.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.040]   That is the best bumper we've ever made.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.240]   Hey, welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.000]   friends in Fort Worth and in Plano,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.360]   and those tuning in and joining us around.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.760]   I'm gonna read the passage that we're gonna be in tonight
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.800]   as we continue the series,
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.720]   Thou Shalt and Look at the Ten Commandments.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.600]   So we're gonna be Exodus chapter 20.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.840]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.440]   If not, it'll be on the screens
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.280]   and on these large screens here.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.560]   And I'm gonna start in verse 12 of chapter 20,
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.080]   and we will read through verse 17.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.000]   So it says this,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.560]   honor your father and your mother
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.200]   so that you may live long in the land
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.400]   the Lord your God is giving you.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.240]   You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery,
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.020]   you shall not steal,
[00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.120]   you shall not give false testimony against your neighbor,
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.920]   you shall not covet your neighbor's house,
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.040]   you shall not covet your neighbor's wife
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.620]   or his male or female servant or his ox or his donkey
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.520]   or anything that belongs to him.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.320]   Let me pray and then we'll dive in.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.160]   Father, we pray that you would instruct our hearts
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.680]   and teach us from your ancient scriptures
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.720]   and that these words that were given long ago
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.300]   to the nation of Israel,
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.760]   that were given to lead them to life,
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.560]   would do so tonight in the hearts of your people.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.860]   Would you teach us, strengthen us, help us to see Jesus.
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.560]   Pray all this in his name, amen.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.800]   Well, in my house,
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.040]   we've been talking a lot about discipline lately
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.080]   because my wife and I have a son
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.640]   who is kind of around the age of two
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.040]   and he's at this weird age where we're trying to figure out,
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.120]   you know, will spanking work?
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.960]   'Cause up to this point,
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.040]   anytime he gets spanked, he doesn't totally understand it.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.040]   So he thinks it's a game.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.440]   So he'll either just laugh or he'll hit you back
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.120]   and be like, hey, two can play this one.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.120]   And he just doesn't totally get it.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.260]   And we can't do timeout yet because he's two.
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.160]   So timeout, he'll like just start tearing down the dresser
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.080]   and break something or break him.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.640]   And so we're kind of caught in this middle stage.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.000]   And I don't know where you grew up,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.960]   but when I grew up, when I grew up,
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.180]   the spanking thing, especially at an early age,
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.560]   was not something that, hey, we kind of thought about.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.520]   We believed in laying on of hands in my family.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.040]   And you got spanked if you misbehaved,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.040]   and especially early on.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.720]   Now, as you got older and, you know,
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.160]   your size and you get bigger,
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.320]   all of a sudden you kind of transition
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.720]   to the grounding phase and you leave out the spanking thing.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.860]   But it was always worse, or if you remember,
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.240]   that experience of whenever you switched over
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.800]   to no longer being spanked, and yes,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.280]   I can't believe I'm opening with this right now.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.800]   But whenever that happened, you always longed for like,
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.600]   oh man, I just wish that I could go back to the spanking,
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.820]   not be grounded and have to miss out
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.760]   on the party on Friday night.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.520]   You seriously have to be home by the streetlights.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.600]   Come on, can't we just go back to kind of the old system
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.640]   that you punished there?
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.480]   And because it only lasted a moment
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.840]   and went nearly as bad as being grounded
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.000]   or restricted from leaving the home,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.600]   cut off from all your friends.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.200]   And as I thought about that this week,
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.840]   really, when you think about discipline,
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.200]   like the worst disciplines that people normally give
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.960]   or worst punishments that people give
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.760]   in all these different contexts have to do
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.120]   with being cut off or being separated
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.320]   from other people or relationships.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.180]   Like think about it inside of your home
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.920]   where you get grounded, hey, you can't go out
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.760]   with your friends.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.000]   At school, if you were part of the public school system,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.320]   if you misbehaved or someone you knew misbehaved,
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.520]   they got in a fight in class or something happened,
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.960]   they would be set aside or cut off
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.400]   from the rest of the class in detention.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.600]   And then if they continued to misbehave,
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.360]   continued to act out, they would be cut off
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.880]   where they'd say, hey, you can't come here
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.960]   for the next few days, you are suspended.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.000]   And then if it got really bad, they would be what?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.880]   Expelled.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.020]   And they would be, hey, you can no longer come here
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.320]   ever again, good luck out there, get your GED.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.880]   And they would totally remove you.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.440]   And not only does it happen in the education system,
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.000]   think about the prison or the criminal system.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.760]   Like the justice system is built on prison
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.240]   is essentially the government saying,
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.560]   hey, you broke society's law,
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.560]   we're gonna give you a time out.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.160]   And you're gonna be set aside for a year, two years,
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.200]   six months life at some amount of time.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.600]   Where the punishment given there is,
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.820]   hey, we're gonna cut you off from society,
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.120]   from relationships.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.520]   And then further, if you think about it,
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.800]   if you break the prison's law,
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.980]   there's an even worse punishment,
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.080]   the worst living punishment that we have
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.280]   comes for those who can't abide by
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.360]   or keep the prison's law,
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.240]   something called solitary confinement,
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.360]   which is total removal of any relationships
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.400]   or any other humans inside of your life.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.760]   I mean, literally, it is the worst punishment
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.140]   that we have in our system,
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.680]   the worst living punishment that we have in our system.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.520]   And it's simply this,
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.100]   we're gonna cut you off entirely
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.600]   from any sort of human interaction
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.320]   in any sort of human life.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.960]   I mean, it's such a, it does such damage
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.460]   in a lot of the people who have solitary confinement
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.980]   that it's constantly being evaluated of like,
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.140]   man, is this a violation of human rights?
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.860]   Think about that, like that's crazy.
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.100]   Because there's something inside of all of us
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.260]   where what we discover is when someone
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.580]   is put in solitary confinement,
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.500]   like they psychologically begin to break down.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.100]   They begin to come like less than human.
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.940]   Like there's something inside of you
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.140]   and something inside of me that can't function
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.140]   if we're totally cut off from other people.
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.540]   We weren't made to be cut off from other people.
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.460]   And the reason I start there
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.780]   is because in the same way that you and I share
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.100]   this deep need to have human relationships
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.940]   with other people,
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.660]   we also share this thing inside of us called sin nature
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.460]   or something broken where we,
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.500]   though we have a need to have human relationships,
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.220]   constantly sabotage our relationships
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.340]   by our own sin or our own decisions,
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.420]   our own, you know, the ways that we fail to,
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.060]   you know, follow God's law
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.660]   or just do what the right thing is,
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.620]   fail to tell the truth, you know,
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.260]   keep our word, fail to care for people.
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.920]   It's the reason why 50% of marriages end in divorce
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.700]   because though people have a desperate need
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.040]   for relationship, we all have that.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.100]   It's clear to see people also have something inside of them
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.580]   that makes it hard for them
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.840]   to function in those relationships.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.660]   And this isn't a modern day problem exclusively.
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.300]   It's a problem that has existed for a long time.
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.260]   It's a problem that when God looked down
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.300]   at the nation of Israel, he said,
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.780]   "Look, I don't want you to live in solitary confinement,
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.360]   "isolated from one another,
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.460]   "not because of a prison cell,
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.620]   "but in your own mind,
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.420]   "you have created solitary confinement
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.860]   "because the decisions you made have cut you off
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.800]   "from being able to have healthy relationships
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.640]   "with other people."
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.980]   So he looked down at the nation, he said,
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.620]   "I'm gonna give you rules to follow
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.580]   "so that you don't, because of your sin nature,
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.960]   "cut yourself off from other people.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.620]   "And I'm gonna give you laws
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.100]   "that will tell you how to live amongst one another."
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.620]   So tonight, we're gonna look at commands five through 10
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.340]   of the 10 commandments where God essentially says
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.160]   to the nation, "Hey, I wanna give you instructions
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.980]   "on how you are to relate to one another,
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.660]   "how you are to treat one another,
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.240]   "how you can live in society together,
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.820]   "'cause I'm a God who loves you.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.620]   "I don't want you to be cut off.
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.160]   "I don't want you to go through life,
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.700]   "and because of the broken part of you,
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:31.940]   "experience separation in your relationships."
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:32.780]   And so we're gonna pick it up
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.460]   in the fifth command tonight as we explore
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.900]   just these commands that have really everything to do
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.740]   with relationships with one another.
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.460]   In other words, Jesus was asked one day,
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.540]   "Hey, sum up the entire law and the commands."
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.940]   And Jesus was like, "All right, you want me to do it
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:46.860]   "in like tweetable form?
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.680]   "Here's how I would tweet the 10 commandments.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.140]   "Love God, love people."
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.900]   And so inside the 10 commandments,
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.500]   first four are about loving God,
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.020]   and the last six are about loving people.
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.380]   We're gonna look at those six
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.940]   and dive in to God's instructions to the nation of Israel,
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.180]   how they are to relate to one another.
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.580]   If you're just catching up with us,
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.140]   10 commandments were these laws given to the people
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.380]   of this nation of Israel that were given to this people
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.080]   who had just essentially gotten on their feet as a nation.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.220]   They didn't know how to live.
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.940]   God, through Moses, says, "Hey, I'm gonna have you
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.480]   "instruct the people and tell them
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.020]   "how I can lead them to life."
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.820]   Or if they follow these laws, it will lead them to life,
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.340]   and this is how they are to govern one another.
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.420]   If you've missed the last couple weeks,
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.380]   you can go find all the messages that we have on this
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.540]   on the PORCH app, as always, or on the podcast,
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.380]   and we can go from there.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.020]   So we're gonna pick it up in verse 12
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.260]   as we explore these six ideas.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.820]   Normally, we do three kinda breakdowns in the text.
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.100]   We're gonna look at six tonight of these six instructions
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.980]   God gives to the people in the nation of Israel.
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.820]   Here's what he says.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.900]   "Honor your father and your mother."
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.300]   The word honor is essentially ascribe importance
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.580]   or value to, treat as important or valuable
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.500]   your father and your mother,
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.660]   "so that you may live long in the land your Lord,
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.580]   "the Lord your God has given you."
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.700]   If you read this and you're like me, you think,
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.940]   man, God, you're giving insight of your Big Ten, really?
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.260]   Number five is gonna be how you treat your parents?
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.780]   We're really gonna waste time on this?
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.700]   And you're gonna put it above murder and adultery
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.540]   and all that stuff?
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.380]   Really, you're gonna tell us
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.580]   how to interact with our parents?
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.740]   And God, over and over inside of the scriptures,
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.740]   says honor to me is a big deal.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.260]   Our first idea that's right from the text
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.340]   is that you and I, if we were to have healthy
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.460]   or functioning relationships,
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.740]   God would say you have to honor your parents.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.940]   You have to live in a way that treats your parents
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.060]   with the importance that their position,
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.020]   not their behavior, gives them.
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.740]   I am commanding and calling my people,
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.780]   they are to treat their parents with importance.
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.140]   You are to honor your parents.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.580]   Paul picked up on this verse and said that you and I
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.940]   are to honor, in Ephesians chapter six, verse two and three,
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.100]   he says, "You and I honor your father and your mother."
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.500]   So in case you're like, isn't that the Old Testament?
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.340]   What about the New?
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.500]   Paul says, "You are to honor your father and your mother,"
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.980]   which is the first commandment with a promise,
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.300]   so that it may go well with you
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.220]   and you may enjoy long life on the earth.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.900]   So he connects the idea that the only command we're told
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.140]   with that promise is the fifth one, where God says,
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.420]   hey, I want you to honor your father and your mother
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.300]   so much so that if you don't, you are not going to live long
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.580]   in the land that your God is giving you,
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.980]   that I take it very, very seriously.
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.540]   I want you to honor.
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.780]   Honor all throughout the Bible is a big deal to God.
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.740]   I mean, he cares about honoring older people.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.180]   We see that in another place, Leviticus chapter 20,
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.060]   where God says, hey, when you're around people
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.860]   who are your elders, they enter the room,
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.860]   you should stand up.
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:28.700]   Think about that.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.500]   Honor, he talks about honoring the government
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.340]   or honoring the emperor.
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:36.100]   God is all about honor, which I think is hard as Americans
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.180]   for us to really get our arms around
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.220]   'cause we're kind of this individualistic,
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.620]   hey, I don't need to honor anybody, we're all equal.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.100]   Hey, I don't need to stand for anything,
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.260]   and there's part of that that overflows
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.540]   from a freedom that we have, but there's part of it
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.820]   that sets us up to not be able to follow what God says.
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.500]   You and I are called to honor your parents,
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.540]   not because of their behavior,
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.620]   whether or not you think they earned it.
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.940]   But because you're commanded to.
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.020]   In other words, honor is something that's given, not earned.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.140]   And I know this is hard for all of us, myself included,
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.380]   'cause there's this thing where we think like,
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.300]   man, I would honor someone if they deserve it.
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.140]   I mean, you can look around
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.460]   and look at any social media or news.
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.900]   It's not hard to see that in the political climate
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.580]   that we're in, there's just blatant disrespect
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.860]   and dishonor that goes to the government.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.620]   If you're a Christian, that is wrong.
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.940]   And let me play all my cards.
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:28.780]   There's a lot of things.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.580]   I disagree with President Trump.
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.180]   But if you're a follower of Christ,
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.660]   you and I are called to honor the government
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.940]   or the emperor, Paul says in Romans 13.
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.260]   And you may be like, yeah, but you know how bad Trump is.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.900]   He was talking about Nero,
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.500]   who was literally having Christians killed and beheaded.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.660]   And he says, honor that guy.
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.140]   He's a little, he's all kinds, he's cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs,
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.580]   which is what Nero was.
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.580]   He's crazy, but we honor him.
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.900]   God would say, hey, you're supposed to honor.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.700]   Honor's a big deal to God.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.860]   And when it comes to your parents, he says,
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.780]   you and I are called to honor our parents,
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.420]   whether or not we think that they've earned it.
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.940]   Honor's not earned, it's given.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.380]   Inside of a room like this, you may share stories like mine,
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.460]   where hey, my family, I come from a broken home,
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.900]   or my father, I would say, did not earn,
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.540]   or I don't feel like, oh man, he definitely earned honor.
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.180]   It doesn't matter.
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.740]   In my interactions with him, God would say,
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.860]   you're to honor your father and your mother,
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.340]   just like with you.
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.780]   This week at Thanksgiving, you are called,
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.620]   when you sit around the table with your parents,
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.580]   and all the ways that they have, as every parent does
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:39.500]   and will, failed to be God's best as a father and a mother,
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.980]   you are called to honor your father and mother.
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.660]   What does it look like to honor your parents?
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.780]   It doesn't mean that you just don't have boundaries,
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.900]   or you continue to let your parents just hurt you
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.740]   and drive your life.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.820]   It doesn't mean you have to worship
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.540]   the same God that they do.
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.060]   It doesn't mean that you just take abuse and you accept it,
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.060]   but it does mean that you're respectful.
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.540]   That when you interact this week,
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.660]   when you enter back in, maybe you're coming back,
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.700]   you're coming to your home for Thanksgiving,
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.700]   and you're about to step back into where you grew up,
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:10.660]   or where your parents lived.
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.580]   When you step back into that home,
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.220]   you honor, you're respectful of your parents.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.540]   When you engage in the conversation,
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.980]   you don't just blow up at your parents.
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.500]   That you honor and speak respectfully,
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.820]   act respectfully to your parents.
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:25.460]   God would say, out of the 10 commands I could give any,
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.300]   and one of them, number five, I want you to know,
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.980]   it is important that you honor your parents.
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.140]   If they were mean and terrible for me, to me,
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.380]   or mean and terrible to you,
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.420]   do I still have to honor them?
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.460]   Yes, I mean, if for no other reason
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:41.140]   than the very fact that you're here, they played a role in.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.900]   And so there's at least something at the end of the day
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.940]   you can be thankful for.
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.540]   I'm alive, and God would say,
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.660]   honor your father and your mother.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.900]   Side note in dating.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.100]   If you are dating someone, man,
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.740]   one of the crucial thing that you wanna make sure you see
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.340]   is how they treat their parents.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.980]   If you are dating a girl who dishonors her mom,
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.020]   dishonors her father in the way that she interacts with him,
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.780]   talks to them, speaks about them, any of those things,
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.900]   you should be concerned.
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.380]   Because the relationships that exist inside of the home,
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.980]   there are gonna exist inside of your home.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.820]   Same thing with a guy.
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.060]   That you should have red flags
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.820]   if the guy you're dating dishonors his parents,
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.420]   or doesn't speak with respect,
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.340]   or talk about his parents with respect.
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.660]   This is also the reason why this principle
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.460]   of honoring your parents is why we encourage,
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.340]   if you're dating someone as a guy,
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.620]   one of the ways you can lead well in that relationship
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.300]   is by, when it's appropriate,
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.940]   getting time with the father or the mother
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.500]   of the girl that you're dating.
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.500]   And sitting him down, telling him,
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.140]   hey, this is who I am, these are my intentions,
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.700]   this is where I see the relationship going,
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.060]   I'm not wasting her time,
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.740]   I'm interested in pursuing this towards marriage.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.500]   If that doesn't happen, I'm committed to leaving her better
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.380]   than I found him, her, and him or her, I guess,
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.500]   and whatever I need to do to communicate well with you,
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.300]   I want to do that, I wanna honor possibly
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.140]   my future father and mother-in-law.
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.020]   So God says, honor your parents, first thing.
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.620]   Number two, as it relates to living in a way
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.260]   that won't have society cut off
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.660]   and dysfunctional relationally, he says this.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.340]   You shall not, verse 13, murder.
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.420]   So God commanded, you shall not take the life
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.260]   of another person.
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.980]   Second idea, we don't murder.
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.740]   I think most of us in the room are like,
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.980]   all right, check, we can move on, I haven't done this one.
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.300]   Until, and if not, never mind.
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.380]   And, but until you get to the words of Jesus
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.540]   in Matthew chapter five, when Jesus shows up
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.380]   and in Sermon on the Mount,
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.660]   Jesus' most famous sermon ever,
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.980]   Matthew chapter five, verse 28,
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.260]   looks out in this crowd and he gives
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.300]   all these different instructions,
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.020]   and one of them is, hey, you've heard it said,
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.460]   you shall not murder, and I tell you
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.100]   that if you hold anger in your heart,
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.580]   that you, I'll just read it so I don't butcher it,
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.420]   that you shall not murder,
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.260]   and anyone who murders is subject to judgment,
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.860]   but I tell you that anyone who is angry
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.220]   with a brother or a sister will be subject to judgment.
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.460]   It's the same punishment, the same sin.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.180]   You've heard it said, don't murder and you're fine.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.420]   I tell you that if you harbor anger
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.700]   towards someone inside of your heart,
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.420]   it's the same sin.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.860]   You're a murderer, he says.
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:11.140]   In our country today, there's not only a lot of people
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.180]   who are harboring anger, and Jesus would say,
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.980]   you've got to deal with that.
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.740]   There are people you need to go forgive,
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.140]   ask forgiveness from.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.340]   The verse right after that says,
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.780]   you need to leave your gift at the altar,
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.780]   stop worshiping God, and go be reconciled with that person.
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.700]   There's not only a lot of people
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.380]   who are harboring anger in their heart,
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.100]   and Jesus would say, that's murderous to you and to me,
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.380]   but we as a country and a society continue
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.100]   to still allow and accept murder,
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.620]   the taking of a human life, which God says is not okay.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.380]   Every life out there was made in the image of God himself,
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.620]   unlike anything else in creation.
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.700]   Human life is distinct, he says,
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.180]   and the way that primarily,
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.100]   or one of the chief ways that this happens,
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.220]   not the only way this happens, is through abortion.
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:02.260]   Since 1973 in Roe versus Wade,
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.020]   60 million lives have been lost.
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.860]   I mean, that is 20% of the population.
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.500]   That's a fifth of our country gone.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.660]   And the world around us that continues,
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.300]   I mean, the good news is scientifically,
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.820]   as we continue to see more and more
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:22.540]   of what's inside of the womb,
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.500]   many people are coming to the conclusion
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.860]   that, hey, that is a life.
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.860]   I can see its eyes, I hear its heartbeat,
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.780]   I can see all the different parts that make it up,
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.500]   and more and more people, and what I mean by that
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.060]   is like the generation that we're a part of
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.700]   is more pro-life than the generation in front of us.
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.020]   Like people are beginning to go,
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.540]   hey, I think this is wrong.
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:43.260]   It's becoming more clear, and the generation after us
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.580]   is more conservative than any of the generations
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.980]   in front of us, other than the Great Depression generation.
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.900]   Think about that.
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.100]   So the good news is there's hope for those of us
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.100]   who hope to see and believe that we will see
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.860]   in our lifetime abortion ended in our generation.
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.640]   And so there's hope there, and if it's a part of your story,
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.240]   where at some point in the past, you made the decision,
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.640]   to do something that others may have encouraged,
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.520]   or maybe you've never even talked about,
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.400]   here's what you need to know.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.960]   There's not just hope for our country,
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.400]   there's grace for you.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.480]   The same guy, Moses, who was helping
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.120]   write down the Ten Commandments said,
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.040]   I'm a murderer, that's Moses.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.120]   And yet God looked at him and said,
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.840]   you're gonna be the one who leads my people.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.400]   Whatever's a part of your past is not a problem for God.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.880]   And he doesn't change how he feels about you,
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.040]   his love for you, and his grace that's offered
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.440]   to anyone who will freely accept it.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.240]   And he'll take that part of your past
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.520]   and use it as a platform to tell other people
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.400]   about him and his goodness.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.120]   But it is still a problem in our country.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.760]   So he says, you shall not take human life, murder.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.120]   The third one is, you shall not commit adultery.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.280]   You shall not commit adultery,
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.080]   that you're not to have sex outside of marriage.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.040]   And if you're like, man, but technically,
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.000]   adultery involves someone who's married,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.840]   again, that would work until we get to Jesus,
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.200]   who in Matthew chapter five, looked out into this crowd
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.360]   and he said, hey, you've heard,
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.400]   you shall not commit adultery.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.520]   So as long as you don't sleep with a married woman,
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.000]   or as long as no one is married and involved,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.840]   then that's fine.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.200]   And he says, look, if you even lust at someone,
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.000]   you have committed adultery with them in your heart.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.800]   And then Paul, who says, look, any sex
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.840]   that takes place outside of marriage is sexual immorality.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.880]   I mean, so very quickly, everyone in the room goes,
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.520]   yep, okay, guilty.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.240]   Sexual immorality or adultery, Jesus would say.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.520]   If you think that you have to sleep with someone
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.000]   to be an adulterer, you're wrong.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.560]   And he looks out in this crowd and says,
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.200]   man, the standard is way higher.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.600]   And Moses tells the people of God,
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.840]   you are not to allow, you are to keep sex sacred,
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.840]   if you will, or keep sex for the context of marriage.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.200]   Don't have sex outside of marriage
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.360]   was the third point that I wrote down from that.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.120]   Which is a huge, it's crazy.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.760]   When you think about it in Jesus's terms,
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.720]   think about the amount of just adultery
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.560]   that it's really almost acceptable in our culture today.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.720]   If lust counts, which is what Jesus says
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.320]   in Matthew chapter five, I mean, truly,
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.120]   we're all adulterers.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.320]   And in our country today, I mean, it's almost encouraged.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.080]   It's an industry that's exploding
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.840]   and making billions of dollars every year.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.800]   The erotic romance novel business alone,
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.600]   think about this, is over a billion dollars a year
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.760]   with Fifty Shades of Grey and all the different books
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.120]   that come out of that.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.520]   The pornography industry makes more money
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.680]   than all of NBA, MLB, NFL all combined.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.400]   It accounts for 43% of internet activity
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.320]   where Jesus would say that's adultery.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.880]   And if that's a part of your story,
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.000]   man, we have all kinds of,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.200]   if that's going on in your present,
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.120]   which candidly, I know it is inside a room like this.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.920]   70% statistically of men have been involved
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.600]   in pornography in the recent past,
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.040]   last month to six weeks.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.280]   And one in three users are women.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.160]   And if that's a part, we've got all kinds of resources.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.440]   We would encourage you, you can't fight that alone.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.760]   You can go to the Porch blog, you can go to our website,
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.040]   you can find all kinds of stuff
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.240]   and learn and we'll meet with you, talk with you,
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.600]   pray with you, share from our own experience
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.040]   of how pornography has come in
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.640]   and you see it in a moment,
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.320]   but it takes a lifetime to get rid of seeing it
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.480]   and how you can experience freedom from that.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.680]   But Jesus would say, and Moses said,
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.280]   and God said to my people, you shall not commit adultery.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.040]   Keep sex sacred.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.920]   Do not defile the marriage bed
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.840]   or keep sex in the context of marriage and marriage alone.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.840]   And the reason why this was such a big deal to God
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.920]   and he hits on it over and over and over again, here's why,
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.000]   is because God knows that anytime you play with sex,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.840]   we've talked about this a lot,
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.080]   but outside of the context of marriage,
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.160]   it's only hurting the people involved.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.040]   Like it's not just, hey, it's two consenting adults,
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.320]   it's no big deal, it's hurting and it's gonna create scars
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.680]   anytime sex is introduced outside of the context of marriage.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.640]   Homosexual sex, oral sex, any type of sex,
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.460]   it only creates scars in the people that are a part of it.
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.740]   I was reading a book last week, or a couple weeks ago,
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.180]   and inside of the book, it was talking about,
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.980]   this is gonna feel like a really sharp left turn
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:06.020]   from defining adultery, it was talking about sharks.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.620]   And-- (congregation laughing)
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.300]   And the mating patterns of sharks.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.180]   And the book was basically saying that, hey,
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.980]   the way that you identify if a female shark
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.580]   has mated or procreated is that they have scars
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.300]   on their body, that there's mating scars that come up,
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.540]   that the way that they mate is the male shark
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:30.100]   will come on up and he will bite onto the female shark
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:35.100]   in order to secure or hold himself as the shark mates on.
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.220]   I know, your minds are running a ton of different places.
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.180]   Bite the tattoo on the shark's shoulder.
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.260]   And that will be how you can tell.
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.820]   Like in other words, if you're studying sharks,
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.980]   you can be like, oh, those are mating scars,
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.380]   they're scars, scars mean sex in the shark world.
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.300]   In the human world.
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.900]   Sex means scars.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.020]   But none of us, it's impossible,
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.020]   outside of the context of marriage,
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.220]   you cannot escape the fact that if you introduce sex
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.380]   in any relationship, any part of your past,
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.860]   that it's going to bring scars, what kind of scars?
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.140]   It's gonna bring dysfunction into a relationship,
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.300]   but even think about this, I mean,
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.260]   the scars that will come in five years from now
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.100]   when you're married and your spouse is wondering
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.420]   how you're comparing them to other people
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.580]   that they've slept with.
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:21.180]   I mean, it'll bring scars in just the ways
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.100]   that it breaks apart relationships,
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.860]   it keeps relationships together longer
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.140]   than they ever should have been
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.220]   because of kind of the euphoria,
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.140]   and it's like electricity when we touch
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.060]   because of just amazing sex together,
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.900]   and they never should have been a relationship that stayed,
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.420]   and finally it breaks apart,
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.820]   causes all kinds of pain and heartache there.
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.380]   That just like in the shark world,
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.140]   where sex means scars are there,
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.540]   in the human world, outside of the context of marriage,
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.060]   sex means scars, and God, who looks down
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:48.900]   at the nation of Israel, says,
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.260]   I don't want you to take this incredible gift
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.020]   outside of marriage, or it will bring scars.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.420]   Do not commit adultery, nation of Israel.
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.940]   He then goes into stealing.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:02.340]   He says this, verse 15, you shall not steal.
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.820]   And again, I think this is one where we think,
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.820]   man, I haven't stolen, I don't steal,
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.140]   it's not a big problem for me,
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.180]   not something I need a lot of accountability on.
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:17.180]   I think the most common theft that has taken place,
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.500]   maybe in general, but at least inside of this room,
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.620]   is stealing from our employer.
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.700]   Salary.com did a study where they found
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.580]   that the average employee, out of an eight-hour day,
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.940]   does not work for two hours of that day,
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.220]   or does not do things that are associated
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.740]   with their company and their organization,
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.300]   that they will spend it either surfing the internet,
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.700]   was 43% of the reason why people did it,
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.460]   to on social media, to socializing,
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.980]   to just doing kind of personal things,
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.860]   and taking care of personal business,
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.980]   or bills, or different things, but two hours,
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.620]   think about that, that's stealing from your employer.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.380]   As Christians, we're told in Titus chapter two
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.100]   that we're to do everything at our jobs,
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.940]   or at work, in a way that makes the teachings
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.940]   of our Savior, Titus chapter two,
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.180]   that makes the teachings of our Savior more attractive.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.380]   And then it says this right after,
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.100]   and do not steal.
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.780]   That it's, as followers of Christ, inside of our workplace,
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:09.940]   we should be the hardest workers,
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.780]   not the ones who are gonna, if we can,
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.940]   get away with not working the way that we say we should.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.140]   The way that we say that we're working for.
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.020]   And I think Jesus and Moses would say that stealing,
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.580]   you're taking what's not yours.
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:27.460]   He then says this, you shall not give false testimony
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.740]   against your neighbor, that you shall not lie,
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.020]   that you and I are to speak the truth.
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.180]   How do we have healthy relationships among God's people?
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.260]   That we speak the truth, the whole truth,
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.320]   and nothing but the truth.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.700]   That we don't lie on our resume,
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.860]   we don't lie about our past, you know,
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.140]   sport abilities to make ourselves look better,
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.980]   about you should have seen me in high school,
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.060]   would have made it pro, but you know, my knee.
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.300]   And we don't lie about anything like that.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:56.300]   We don't lie about, you know, our job experience.
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.300]   We don't lie.
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.980]   That we speak the truth to one another.
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.540]   We don't spread slander or false testimony about people.
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.620]   We don't gossip.
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.180]   And you may be being like, look, I gossip,
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.580]   but I only tell the truth.
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.860]   I've got great sources.
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.980]   Gossip is also a sin.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.220]   And so it's not like a loophole there.
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.380]   But the way that we use our words,
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.700]   we speak the truth to one another.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.340]   We don't shrink back from telling the truth.
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.980]   When someone wants an honest answer,
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.500]   we do it and speak the truth in love.
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.820]   That's what Christians do.
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.600]   And God says, in order to have healthy relationships
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.060]   among my people, you've got to speak the truth
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.660]   to each other, honesty.
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:34.800]   And then he gets to the sixth or the final command,
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.900]   which I think is the most profound out of all of them,
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.220]   or in reading it, it seemed profound to me
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.700]   and ministered to me, where he says this,
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.300]   talking about covet, you shall not covet,
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.460]   which just means, hey, strongly desire or be jealous for
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:53.220]   your neighbor's house or your neighbor's wife
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.580]   or his female and male servant or his ox or his donkey,
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.540]   which would be like the SUV he drives
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.700]   or the car that he drives,
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.660]   or anything else that belongs to your neighbor.
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.020]   Now, covet, as we said, covet is to strongly desire
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.740]   or almost lust after.
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.180]   You can tell that you're coveting if you are unhappy
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:14.740]   because of what you have or don't have that others do.
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:16.180]   You can tell that you're coveting, I mean,
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.700]   honestly, Instagram should just be changed to covet.com.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.260]   That's essentially what so much of it is,
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:21.560]   where you're just like, oh my gosh,
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.060]   I can't believe it again, and why is she always posting
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.500]   about her wedding dress and how she can't find it yet,
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.880]   and you're just seeing and scrolling through.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.860]   It's crazy how Instagram or social media in general
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.620]   has fueled this inside of our country.
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.540]   And what's so unique about this law is,
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.380]   think about it with me for a second.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:43.380]   That's the only law on there that you can't police.
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.020]   Every other law, you can make up a policing system,
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.260]   you can catch someone a lie, they had adultery,
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.480]   you caught 'em there, he murdered,
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.320]   hey, we can chase this down, detective, I found it.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.580]   This is the only unenforceable law that exists on there.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.540]   In other words, no one's ever gonna call the police
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.580]   and be like, yes, officer, I need to report something.
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.020]   There's a guy outside my house,
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.780]   and I think he's gone from admiring to coveting,
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.960]   and someone needs to get over here, man.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.980]   Nobody would ever even attempt to enforce it.
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.500]   There's no nation on Earth that has a law like this,
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.020]   because it has nothing to do with the outside,
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:13.800]   it's all about the inside.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:18.380]   And God, through this law, says to the nation of Israel
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.060]   that I'm a God who cares about the heart.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.220]   I don't just care about the hands
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.380]   and what you do on the outside, I care about your heart.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.740]   I don't want you to be ruled.
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.020]   I don't want your emotions to be ruled
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.840]   by what you have or you don't have,
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.980]   and why everyone else seems to get married,
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:37.860]   and how your friends are all in the next phase
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.780]   of life with their toddler at the mall
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.660]   in Lululemon clothes, and you're just depressed about it.
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.700]   I don't want you to be ruled by that,
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:44.700]   or how much money you make,
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:45.620]   or any of those different things.
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.700]   Any of the things that, candidly, it's so easy.
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.500]   I think if there's one sin on here
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.380]   that is very acceptable in Dallas, it's this one.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.540]   Honestly, I don't even think,
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.820]   nobody ever feels even guilty about this one.
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.700]   Think about it.
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.260]   Like, I've never had someone come down front
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.220]   after any message and be like, hey, I just need to,
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.780]   I just need to tell someone, can we get a little private?
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:11.780]   I've been coveting, and I just, I'm overwhelmed with guilt.
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.300]   Like, no one, you coveted today,
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.460]   and you don't feel guilty about it,
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.300]   and God says, I care about the heart.
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.080]   I care about it.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.300]   It may not be policeable.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.260]   Others may not see it.
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.260]   I care about you not being ruled by what you don't have.
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.060]   The sixth thing is don't covet.
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.340]   Nation of Israel, I do not want you to be ruled
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.460]   by what you have or what you don't have.
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:36.880]   As we've said before, comparison is the thief of joy.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:43.300]   And it is no surprise why depression is up
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.700]   and linked to social media, as we are exposed,
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.100]   not just to what our friends have,
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.140]   it used to be kind of like, hey, if I want to be,
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.420]   if I want to covet what you have,
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.220]   I gotta come over to your house and kind of see things.
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.860]   Now, it's all online, and I can see it all.
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.420]   I can see what celebrities, what total strangers have
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.200]   to be discontent about my life, and God says,
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.620]   I don't want you to be ruled.
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.140]   Maybe the healthiest thing some of us in the room
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.380]   tonight need to do is you gotta get off Instagram.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.680]   You gotta put the Pinterest away.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.420]   You gotta get off Facebook or whatever is feeding that
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:19.060]   inside of you, and you know at the end of the day,
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.960]   like, it's impacting your emotions, your anxiety,
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:26.380]   your happiness, and God says, I don't want you
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.500]   to be ruled by anything other than me.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.240]   As you look at the commands, and I'll really close here,
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.560]   I mean, you go through the list, and you're like,
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.500]   oh man, as it relates to interacting with other people,
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:42.600]   I've fallen short of this standard.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.160]   I mean, especially when Jesus shows up
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.880]   and he raises everything and says, hey, look,
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.440]   you think murder is the only thing you need
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.280]   to be worried about?
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.920]   If you have anger, you're a murderer,
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.800]   and Jesus shows up and he says, you're an adulterer,
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.640]   and so if you recap the commandments,
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.680]   you sit in this room right now, many of us,
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.760]   most of us, probably all of us, if we're all of us,
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.600]   if we're honest, and if not, you broke the other,
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.800]   or you broke the lying command, would say,
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.480]   according to the Bible or Jesus, I'm a murderer.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.120]   I'm an adulterer.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.880]   I'm a liar, I'm a thief, I covet,
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.680]   and I have fallen short of what God's requirements
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:20.280]   or the standards of the 10 commandments and the law.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.680]   That whatever, if that's the standard,
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.920]   I've fallen way short of it, and Jesus himself
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.800]   is gonna show up and say, you have fallen
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.920]   even farther from it than you think,
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.840]   and in that same Sermon on the Mount,
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.160]   he looked out in the crowd, and here's what he said.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.000]   It was crazy.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.800]   You must be perfect.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.360]   Wait, Jesus, you know, like the whole,
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.960]   you know, like, give me a hug, you're my homeboy,
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.560]   Jesus, you know, we're tight, and you're awesome,
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.080]   and you're loving and accepting.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.120]   He looked out in the crowd and he said,
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.400]   you must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:50.400]   That's the standard.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.680]   If you wanna get in on your own,
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.880]   you wanna do it through your obedience,
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.720]   you must be perfect.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.640]   And unless your righteousness, he says,
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.120]   exceeds that of this really religious group
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.080]   called the Pharisees, he says,
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.480]   unless your righteousness exceeds that of the Pharisees,
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.040]   you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.520]   What, Jesus, are you saying?
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.360]   That you are not enough.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.400]   And on your own, you will never get there.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.560]   You will never behave your way into a relationship
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.480]   with a God who's there and died and loves you.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.400]   How do I know that even the 10 commandments
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.520]   point to this idea?
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.680]   What happens after the 10 commandments?
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.480]   You know what happens in the very next verses
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.320]   after the 10 commandments?
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.920]   And this, like, ministered me so much this week.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.440]   It was so crazy.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.040]   Two verses later, what happens in the 10 commandments?
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.480]   It doesn't get a lot of playtime.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.160]   Like, the verse is kinda right after the 10.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.560]   It's not like, oh, that's my favorite
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.480]   memory verse right there.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.440]   That doesn't get a lot of playtime,
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.120]   but what happens?
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:37.960]   Let's read it.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.720]   Then the Lord said, in verse 22 of chapter 20 to Moses,
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.200]   tell the Israelites this, you have seen for yourselves
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.600]   that I have spoken to you from heaven.
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.280]   Don't make any other gods alongside of me
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.480]   and don't bring or don't make yourself gods
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.520]   of silver or gold.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.640]   Here's what I want you to do.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.840]   The first proactive command,
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.520]   you are to make yourself an altar.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.440]   Make yourself an altar of earth for me
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.720]   and sacrifice on it.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:04.320]   And bring your burnt offerings, which is for sin,
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.440]   and your fellowship offerings,
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.040]   which is to have a relationship with me,
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.160]   your sheep and your goats and your cattle,
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.360]   that you are to make sacrifices.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.160]   I want you to build an altar.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.080]   And wherever I cause my name to be honored,
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.600]   I will come to you and bless you.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.440]   What is the very first thing?
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.280]   God finishes the list, and then what does he say?
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.080]   I want you to build me an altar.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.000]   Because you're not gonna be able to keep this list.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.960]   And I want you to take sacrifices and animals.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.440]   And every time that you sin, I want you to kill animals
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.840]   because I want you to associate
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.640]   that a sacrifice needs to be paid if there is sin.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.880]   And I'm not a God who's saying,
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.480]   hey, I expect you to keep it.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.120]   It's as though, I mean, think about it.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.760]   It's the next verses.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.280]   Here's the commands, you won't keep 'em,
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.800]   so bank an altar because sacrifices need to be paid.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.880]   And every single page, he's pointing to the fact
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.160]   that if there's sin, it requires a sacrifice.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.000]   It's almost as though he's saying,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.760]   I know that you will not be able to keep the law,
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.120]   and I'm going to provide a way.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.120]   And this sacrificial system will ultimately point,
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.520]   not to a sacrifice of a blood or a goat or anything,
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.760]   but to what Jesus would do on the cross.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.560]   From every page in the scripture,
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.840]   we see that it's always been pointing to Jesus.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.360]   I mean, think about it, two verses.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.080]   Here's the list, you can't keep 'em.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.800]   You need a sacrificial system.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.040]   And this system right now is just gonna be temporary
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.000]   because it's gonna point like everything else in the Bible
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.200]   to a Savior who will be the one
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.200]   who will bridge the gap for you,
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.080]   for all the ways that you and I have failed
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:33.600]   to meet the standard and failed more than we even realize.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.040]   And he says it's always been pointing to this one.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:41.720]   In every passage of the New Testament,
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.720]   it's all about him, it's all pointing to him.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.880]   It's all about Jesus, and what that means
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.240]   is that nobody gets to stand up here,
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:50.080]   we don't worship anybody because of the way
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.320]   that they were able to keep the law.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.840]   In other words, we don't sit here and be like,
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.520]   oh, praise the name of it.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.720]   That guy Bob, we'll praise his name, he's awesome.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.200]   That all of it goes to Jesus.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.800]   And it's all about him, and he would look
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.160]   to the nation of Israel and say, I'm gonna give you laws,
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.160]   and I know you won't be able to keep 'em.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:15.240]   But would your inability and the fact
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.480]   that every time there is sin, there will be sacrifice,
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.840]   point you to the fact that one day
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.520]   I will put an end to the altars,
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.040]   and I will put an end to the sacrifice
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:26.200]   because I will become a man, Jesus,
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.960]   God, become a man to die on a cross,
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.840]   to pay for the penalty of every sin,
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.840]   of every infraction against the holy,
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.200]   eternal God, and pay for your sin.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.640]   And I don't even wanna put too many paragraphs
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.720]   between these commands and the requirement
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.880]   of a system that would point you to a savior.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.560]   It's all about him.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:54.000]   It's always been about him, it will always be about Jesus.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.840]   Let me pray.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:06.600]   Father, thank you that 3,000 years ago,
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:15.680]   4,000, that you not only just gave the law
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.000]   and you spoke to your people,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.080]   you said that there will come a day,
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:29.080]   a day that no more sacrifices will be required
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.460]   because you, perfect, holy, righteous one,
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.560]   will become the sacrifice on our behalf.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.480]   I pray for friends in the room
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.160]   that are filled with the idea that,
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.320]   man, I'll never be good enough,
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.680]   that they would come to the realization
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.720]   that they will never be good enough,
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.400]   but there's a God who loves them so much
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.600]   that he was willing to die for them,
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.280]   and from very early on, he said and spoke the message
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.180]   through the 10 Commandments, he will never be good enough,
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.700]   and sacrifice will be required,
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.040]   but I will pay that sacrifice.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.320]   Thank you that every page of Scripture,
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.360]   every system that was given to us
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.880]   points to our savior in Jesus,
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.720]   and we worship him in song, amen.
