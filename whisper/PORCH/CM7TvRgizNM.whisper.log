[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:23.720]   - All right, let's go.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.360]   Welcome friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth,
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.440]   Houston, El Paso, Austin, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.040]   Tulsa, Woodlands, Phoenix, San Antonio.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.600]   The left one out, welcome to you.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.840]   Hey, wherever you're joining us from,
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.960]   and especially friends in the room,
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.260]   we are kicking off a new series called Mood,
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.480]   which is a look at human emotions
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.240]   from a biblical perspective.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.160]   Emotions are something that all of us deal with,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.380]   all of us experience, they have a big impact on our life.
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.680]   So for the next six weeks,
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.640]   we're gonna cover what a biblical perspective
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.600]   on how to handle and think about really your emotions
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.200]   and really look at several different specific emotions
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.480]   week after week.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.400]   So that's where we're headed tonight.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.060]   We're just gonna do kind of an overview.
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.440]   And to get there, I'm gonna launch in by bringing up
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.080]   what I think is the best part of living in 2019
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.040]   as it relates to emotions.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.300]   And that is that we have developed a new way
[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.840]   of communicating our emotions that is called the emoji.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.040]   That we have gone from, I don't know,
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.120]   like when you started texting,
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.320]   this was at one point like the thing
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.400]   that if you've got an emoji text message from somebody,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.200]   it's kind of like, oh my gosh, this person is a psychopath.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.600]   And now it's just like we all do.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.640]   We don't even use words anymore,
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.000]   we're just sending happy faces or different signs.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.520]   So I put together some of my favorites
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.640]   as it relates to emojis.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.420]   Here's one that I feel like is most commonly used.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.640]   Here's what's interesting about this one.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.400]   This is meant to represent the laugh 'til you cry emoji.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.740]   No one is ever laughing 'til they cry when they send this.
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.580]   Have you noticed this?
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.180]   Like I've been in meetings with people on my team,
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.120]   I don't wanna call them out, Brittany, but.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.880]   No, it wasn't Brittany, I'm sure it was Emily.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.880]   Hey, anyways, we're in the meeting
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.480]   and people will like send a text message to one another
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.480]   and I'll be on that group text and they'll make some joke
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.600]   and I literally, I see everyone,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.880]   we're all sitting in a circle,
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.120]   supposed to be paying attention
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.680]   and they'll do like the laugh out like four of these
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.440]   as though they're dying, crying, laughing 'til they cry
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.480]   and they don't even make like a smirk.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.900]   They don't even do anything.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.960]   It's like the most exaggerated expression of this.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.480]   Here's another one that we have
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.840]   as it relates to emojis, hands up, praise.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.160]   Gotta love this one.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.000]   This is something that I feel like at least guys
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.880]   would never actually do this in real life
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.040]   where someone tells you some good news,
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.880]   you're like yes, yes.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.320]   Maybe some of you would
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.720]   and there's always hope for those of you.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.760]   The next one that I thought would be worth bringing up
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.400]   was oh yeah, the heart face.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.560]   Of course, this is always an interesting one
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.960]   when you get it from like another dude
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.520]   and you're like I don't,
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.120]   or like somebody who's older that just doesn't text that much
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.120]   and like I don't think you know what this is.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.420]   I think communicating here when you send that.
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.480]   Or another one being the hand on the face, of course.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.040]   What was I thinking?
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.060]   Or the just straight up,
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.200]   I'm not even totally sure what this next one is.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.840]   With the teeth going straight out.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.600]   Like I don't know if that's angry
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.480]   or is it just there's a lot of reaction though
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.520]   as though this group knows what it's for.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.640]   And then of course the most famous
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.200]   or infamous of all the emojis
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.280]   and that would be the poop emoji.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.320]   Whatever person at Apple decided
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.240]   we need to put eyeballs on this thing
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.080]   felt like hey, we're gonna send that one back.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.200]   Tell them to put eyes on it.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.640]   That'll make it perfect.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.800]   Just feels like they've got too much time on their hands.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.340]   But although we've developed new ways of communicating
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.240]   what we're feeling and what we're experiencing
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.800]   and some of it's helpful and some of it's not
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.720]   and some of it's honestly not that accurate,
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.000]   what has not changed
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.520]   is that we communicate it through new mediums,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.400]   the human experience and human emotion
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.280]   and our experience of just the spectrum of emotions
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.100]   has not.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.240]   For thousands of years people
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.640]   and the part of emotions being just a part of everyday life,
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.240]   it was a part of today, your work,
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.640]   it's a part of the relationships you have,
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.160]   it's a part of every single one of us
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.100]   inside of this room and everyone listening.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.480]   That emotions, although 2019 we've developed new ways
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.520]   to communicate them,
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.020]   the idea of emotions and the human experience of emotion
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.480]   is nothing new.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.800]   And so we're gonna launch into this series
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.400]   to cover really what God would have for you
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.720]   as it relates to emotions
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.440]   'cause candidly there's a lot of confusion
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.680]   around this topic.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.380]   Our world today, as much as any time I can ever remember
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.460]   since I've been alive,
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.640]   is a place where it's a very confusing world
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.520]   where hey, feelings mean more than anything to many people.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.600]   And at the same time, God is not anti-feelings.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.220]   And though it would be wrong to say hey, feelings are God,
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.120]   what is true is that feelings are from God
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.960]   and God created us with emotion
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.620]   and so we're gonna launch into just tonight
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.920]   an overview of how you and I should understand emotions
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.160]   'cause there's a lot of confusion
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.080]   and unlike very few issues,
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.160]   maybe more than any other issue in your life,
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.400]   your emotions are gonna significantly impact
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.540]   the future you're gonna have.
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.840]   Our emotions impact the decisions that we make.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.160]   Our emotions impact a lot of our greatest regrets
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.120]   were made out of an emotional response.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.920]   I was afraid of X so I made the decision.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.200]   Our emotions are a key part of any healthy relationship.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.520]   If you're gonna have a relationship,
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.540]   you've gotta know how to keep your emotions in check,
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.320]   how to process 'em, what to do with 'em,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.000]   how to handle 'em, how to communicate 'em,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   how to identify 'em.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.160]   If you're gonna succeed at work, I mean think about it,
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.780]   you can't be effective wherever you end up working
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.240]   if you can't control your emotion.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.520]   Like nobody is giving loose cannon Lisa a promotion.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.140]   If you can't learn how to control your emotions,
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.280]   you're not gonna progress and you won't last long anywhere.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.400]   And God who's there wants you to know
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.880]   how you can control, communicate,
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.160]   identify all the different things,
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.920]   how to operate with your emotions.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.120]   And then the last thing I'd say
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.220]   is just there's a lot of confusion, candidly,
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.960]   that's been introduced at times in the church.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   Where sometimes emotions in church specifically
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.280]   can be given a bad rap.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.800]   As though God is anti-feeling
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.240]   or he doesn't want us to listen to our feelings
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.360]   and if you are listening to your feelings,
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.640]   you should disregard that and just follow your faith
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.000]   as though those are opposite always.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.520]   Or they're pitted against one another.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.480]   Or hey, feelings need to be replaced with truth
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.200]   as though those are always opposite.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.600]   At times they certainly are but at times they're not.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.760]   So how should we think about feelings?
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.840]   So tonight we're gonna just open up this series
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.920]   by looking at an overview
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.560]   of how to understand human emotions.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.340]   So I'm gonna go through three different ideas
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.000]   that we see inside of the scriptures
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.160]   that will cover as it relates to emotions,
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.200]   how to think about it.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.560]   This, in just reading a few books for this message
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.840]   this past week was so helpful in ministry to me.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.180]   So hopefully it's gonna be really helpful.
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.720]   I think for some of us, if you listen and apply,
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.080]   just like myself, it will be life-changing for you
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.760]   because you came into this room right now
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.520]   and you are governed by emotion.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.840]   You're overwhelmed, you're struggling to even listen to me
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.040]   because of the things that you're feeling
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.040]   and you're gonna struggle to become
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.240]   all that God wants you to be and all that you can be
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.840]   if you're not someone who knows how to handle their emotions.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.720]   So we're gonna look at three things.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.320]   If you take notes, you can start with the first one
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.160]   and the first one is this.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.620]   Emotions are a gift from God.
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.660]   Emotions are a gift from God.
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.420]   In other words, emotions are not a bad thing.
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.660]   Emotions are a gift.
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.900]   Emotions were given to us to enhance the human experience.
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.420]   They weren't given to be exalted.
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.140]   They weren't given to be excluded from life.
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.140]   They were given by God to enhance the human experience
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.440]   and particularly to move us out of that emotion.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.980]   The word emotion comes from the Latin word mover, to move,
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.980]   and to move us in the direction of God.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.460]   Think about life when I say enhanced.
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.800]   Think about what life would be like
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.000]   if you didn't experience emotion.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.160]   I mean, think about the person who's getting engaged
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.920]   and their specialist, someone gets down on one knee
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.760]   or you get down on one knee and you propose
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.020]   and you feel nothing inside.
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.920]   You're like, I don't really care.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.200]   Take it or leave it, I'm fine with this.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.480]   You would be like, that person is dead on the inside.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.440]   Life would not be as exciting as that.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.480]   If you heard news of a family member who had cancer
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.280]   and then they came back from a doctor's scan
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.920]   and it was a clean bill of health.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.240]   If someone didn't react, oh my gosh, I'm relieved.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.160]   I feel something.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.140]   You'd be like, that is just bizarre or weird.
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.740]   That emotions are a part of our relationships.
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.900]   If you don't get excited to be around other people,
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.500]   how dull would your relationships be?
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.300]   You wouldn't have friendships
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.580]   at the same degree and same level.
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.200]   That emotions bring out,
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.140]   it's as though they were the sixth sense, if you will.
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.460]   You have taste and feeling and smell and sight and hearing
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.620]   and then God has given us emotions
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.940]   to be a part of the human experience.
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.420]   Emotions are a gift further
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.760]   and that they're a reflection of the image of God.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.860]   In other words, you were made in the image of God,
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.740]   in the image of a God who feels.
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.180]   You guys may not ever think about this stuff,
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.300]   but you know the Bible says that God feels things?
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.540]   Like how crazy and interesting is that?
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.020]   Like God has, as though it were a heart, if you will,
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.420]   he feels things.
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.760]   We're told in really tons of different places,
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.640]   but some of the things that God felt angered
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.100]   at the Israelites in Deuteronomy chapter one, verse 34,
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.660]   he felt pleased at Solomon's decision.
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.020]   In 1 Kings chapter three, verse 10,
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.740]   it says that he's filled with joy and gladness
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.340]   over his people and glad singing.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.380]   The heart of God moves towards,
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.140]   in Zephaniah chapter three, verse 17,
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.020]   that God's heart grieves.
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.900]   In Genesis chapter six, verse six,
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.600]   Jesus was over and over again moved by emotion.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.820]   Paul, the apostle, would say that in Ephesians chapter four,
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.100]   it is possible to grieve the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.820]   Think about that.
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.020]   That the God who's there is not some cold, distant robot.
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.140]   He has emotions, and you were made in his image
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.380]   with emotions, and they're a gift that he has given
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.420]   to move you and to move you in the direction of him.
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.360]   Further, we're commanded in the New Testament
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.940]   to express emotions.
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.060]   Paul says in Romans 12,
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.420]   it's really all over the New Testament,
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.700]   but hey, rejoice with those who rejoice,
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.540]   mourn with those who mourn,
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.440]   that God says, hey, it is a command.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.580]   I want my people to feel.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.540]   So if you came in and you're like,
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.060]   hey, emotions are a bad thing,
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.500]   or emotions are just something I wish
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.620]   that I could get rid of,
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.100]   or emotions are something that God probably
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:16.980]   doesn't want me to listen to
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.860]   or ever have a part of my life,
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.940]   you have been misled.
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.340]   We say that, hey, it's,
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.580]   often you'll hear people say, like,
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.900]   hey, it's not okay to be led by emotion.
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.700]   That is wrong.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.460]   It's not okay to be led by emotion to sin.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.620]   Jesus was led by emotion.
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.680]   So before I get an email, it says,
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.400]   Jesus, in Mark chapter one,
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.720]   was moved by emotion and compassion
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.000]   towards a man who had leprosy.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.160]   That he was moved over and over again.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.000]   I mean, read your Bible.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.120]   Jesus, over and over, was moved.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.320]   What's another word for moved?
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.160]   Led.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.520]   And moved him to act.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.720]   Now, it's the wrong thing to be led
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.000]   always by emotions, and especially in the direction
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.200]   that goes opposite of God's will,
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.140]   but candidly, the problem is not emotions, it's sin.
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:02.980]   People will say things like,
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.080]   hey, you know, in that situation,
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.000]   my emotions got the better of me.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.800]   The truth is, it wasn't your emotions,
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.640]   it's sin got the better of your emotions.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.360]   That's what's taking place.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.080]   Emotions are not a bad thing in and of themselves.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.200]   But if they lead you to sin,
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.980]   is when it is wrong to be led by emotions.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.080]   But emotions are this gift that God has given to all of us.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.880]   The Bible says that in response,
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.760]   as it relates to the idea of,
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.320]   hey, they're to move us towards God.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.780]   James chapter five, verse 13, says that,
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.080]   hey, is anyone joyful?
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.180]   Let him praise God and sing aloud.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.440]   If anyone is afraid, even if you have negative emotions,
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.840]   God's hope is that all the different things
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.720]   that you felt today would be things
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.200]   that you would bring to him.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.160]   Either lead you to respond and praise to him,
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.780]   or lead you to pray to him.
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.960]   It says that, hey, in Psalm 56,
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.160]   when I am afraid, when I am filled with fear,
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.080]   I trust and put my trust in you.
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.040]   So why do they feel not like a gift sometimes?
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.460]   Because sin.
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.500]   In other words, when God created the world,
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.740]   he created you and I and humanity
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.260]   with this ability to have emotions in our mind,
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.380]   in our will, and sin entered into the world
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.740]   through Adam and Eve and their decision,
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.260]   and when that happened, everything broke.
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.140]   And now, literally, everything on the planet
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.660]   has some assembly required, including your emotions.
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.540]   And so this gift that God has given you
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.860]   is one of those things that it doesn't just naturally,
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.580]   today, you can have emotions that will lead you to craziness.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.560]   And if you follow the sinful emotions,
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.520]   they're gonna take you down a path
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.360]   that you don't wanna go to.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.880]   So today, because sin has entered into the world,
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.760]   the gift of human emotion is one of those gifts
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.960]   that just kinda requires, it's some assembly required.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.880]   There's things that God, thankfully, in his word,
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.840]   has said this is how you would operate now
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.740]   with your emotions.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:52.920]   You know what I mean by some assembly?
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.420]   Anyone been given a gift recently
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.120]   that has some assembly required?
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.480]   Anyone given a gift from Ikea?
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.960]   You ever had that happen where it shows up at your door
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.960]   and you're like, oh my goodness,
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.100]   I'm gonna be doing this for the next seven days, okay?
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.620]   That's essentially what God has given us
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.240]   inside of your human emotions.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.580]   And through the gospel and through following Jesus,
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.120]   that is a part of the thing that he says
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.600]   I'm here to reconcile and bring peace about to all things,
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.440]   your heart, your emotions, your mind,
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.880]   your relationships, and all things.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.080]   And so for the next couple points,
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.980]   I wanna just talk about two more aspects
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.060]   of how that assembly takes place.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.620]   And the starting point for that assembly
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.220]   is gonna be the second point, if you take notes,
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.580]   which is this, emotions are not just a gift,
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.740]   they are a gauge.
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.180]   Emotions are a gauge, you know what I mean by gauge?
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.620]   Like they tell you something.
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.320]   Just like a gauge on the dashboard of your car,
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.780]   it tells you, it indicates something.
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.460]   Emotions are meant to be an indicator,
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.760]   or they tell you something.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.320]   Anytime that you feel something,
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.500]   it reflects something inside.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.620]   And I'm gonna tell you exactly what I mean
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.380]   in case you're like, what does that have to do with my life?
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.300]   What are you talking about?
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.840]   In Proverbs 37, verse 19, it says this.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.260]   As water reflects the face, so when you look in the water,
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.580]   you see the reflection of your face.
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.420]   So one's life, that's one's actions and emotions,
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.820]   reflects one's heart.
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.360]   In other words, what your life looks like,
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.300]   hey, how you act, how you feel,
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.720]   what emotions you're experiencing,
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.240]   what actions you do, are directly reflecting
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.240]   what's in your heart.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.660]   In other words, you can see what's in your heart,
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.700]   but based on what emotions you're experiencing.
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.620]   And specifically, when it talks about a gauge,
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.180]   what are you reading,
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.580]   we're told that it reads two specific things.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.940]   But before we go into that,
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.940]   when I, about a week or two ago,
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.920]   I was hanging out with my three-year-old son.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.860]   We're sitting there, we're reading books on the couch.
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.620]   He loves books, he's so pumped about books,
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.460]   but he can't read.
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.420]   So we're sitting there and we're going through,
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.900]   and he's like, hey, what does this say over here?
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.860]   And one time, I don't know what I was thinking,
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.480]   but I was like, what do you think that says,
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.320]   or what does it say?
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.140]   And he looks at me point blank,
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.580]   and it was the greatest thing ever.
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.940]   He was like, I don't know, I can't read.
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.620]   I was like, I'm three, what are you asking me this for?
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.140]   I can't read.
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.500]   And then shortly after that, he began to talk about,
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.580]   I can't wait 'til the day that I can read books.
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.060]   I can sit on my bed and I can read all by myself.
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.520]   Hopefully that day comes,
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.900]   but even as important as that,
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.300]   is the day that comes for his ability to grow,
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.740]   to read emotions, to read his own emotions,
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.300]   to read the emotions of people around him.
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.740]   And though most of us learn at some point
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.780]   how to read and write, especially in America,
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.580]   tragically, very few of us ever learn
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.620]   how to read your emotions because they are a gauge.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.380]   Whatever you're feeling right now
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.560]   is a gauge of what's going on inside of your heart,
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.480]   and specifically, it is a gauge of two things,
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.660]   and this is about to get heady.
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.360]   Everybody put their thinking cap on
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.580]   'cause I think this is gonna be
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.540]   profoundly helpful from God's word,
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:50.360]   but it'll take a little bit of thinking.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.460]   What does it tell me?
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.300]   What is it reading?
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.180]   What is it a gauge of?
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.220]   Specifically, two things, your beliefs and your values.
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.620]   Anytime you have a human emotion,
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.780]   it reflects the intersection of something I value,
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.100]   I care about, that I find worth or a desire of mine,
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.660]   and something I believe.
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.180]   Every single time, there's a human expression.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.480]   I think we've got a slide that'll put this up.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.520]   So every single time, in other words, there's a value,
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.860]   there's something that, if I don't see it as valuable,
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.820]   I'm not gonna experience a human emotion.
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.680]   When I see a squirrel running in the middle of the street,
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.980]   I feel nothing.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.420]   I'm dead on the inside.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.900]   When I see a child, and this is not anti-squirrel,
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.900]   I'm just being honest, people, good grief.
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.540]   Thought this was a safe place.
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.420]   Bunch of squirrel hippies out here.
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.080]   When I see a squirrel running in the middle of the street,
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.380]   I'm like, I don't care, this car's coming,
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.900]   and they do it all the time, good luck.
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:39.900]   When I see a child, good grief, squirrel,
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.500]   is this a PETA gathering?
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:46.260]   When I see a child running in the street,
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.380]   I move with emotion, get out of the road,
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.220]   because I value it more than a squirrel.
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:57.220]   When I see my child, I'm very moved with emotion
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.900]   to act and get out of the way and fear and panic
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.220]   and all those emotions go through my heart,
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.220]   because it's a value thing.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.980]   If you don't value something, if you don't care about it,
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.420]   if you have no worth that you find it,
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.660]   then you're not gonna experience
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.100]   any sort of emotion to that.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.780]   The same is true as it relates to beliefs.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.220]   That in order for you to experience emotion,
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.980]   you've gotta have, it's wherever the intersection
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.140]   and overlap of beliefs and values take place.
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.460]   What do I mean by belief?
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.420]   What you believe about a circumstance,
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.100]   what you think is kinda going on,
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.540]   will impact how your emotions are affected.
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.340]   What's an example?
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.260]   This past weekend, if you were to go to lunch
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.540]   with your mother on Mother's Day,
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.020]   'cause you're a great son or daughter,
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.100]   and you were to call her up and you said,
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.620]   hey, I'll meet you at this restaurant,
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.940]   we're going to lunch, and you went
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.980]   and you got to that restaurant and you waited
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.780]   and you were supposed to meet there at 12,
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.520]   and all of a sudden it's like 12, 20,
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.300]   and you've texted her several times,
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.620]   you're calling her, her phone won't answer.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:53.340]   If you believe that she has gotten in a wreck
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.140]   or an accident, you're gonna be moved towards panic
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.240]   and I need to go find her and what should I do?
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.620]   If you believe she's stuck in traffic
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.140]   and that her phone is dead 'cause she never charges it,
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.660]   you're gonna just get back on your phone
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.080]   and keep sending emojis.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.300]   You're not gonna be moved in the same way.
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.860]   Every single time, this is so huge,
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.480]   and this is going somewhere, because candidly,
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.100]   if I just said, hey, if you're sad in here,
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.480]   stop feeling sad!
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.520]   That may be like, oh, motivational,
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.920]   or yeah, that's a great idea.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.020]   It's not gonna work.
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:26.600]   Because if you don't get to what the Bible
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.320]   in Hebrews chapter four says is the thoughts
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.500]   or beliefs and desires of the heart,
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.680]   and go at those with God's word,
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.460]   you will not experience freedom or any victory
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.320]   in the battle against your emotions.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.840]   So you've gotta understand the battle
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.120]   or the battlefront that you are fighting on.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.600]   And it is related to beliefs and emotions
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.800]   every single time, that your emotions are a gauge
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.880]   that tell you what is taking place on the inside.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.800]   So let's use a couple examples.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.600]   Let's say you go to a wedding,
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.000]   and this past weekend you're at a wedding,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.120]   it's one of your friends, and you're single
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.920]   and not dating anyone, and they put you
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.240]   at the singles table, and you're watching everybody
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.040]   dance over there, and it's your roommate,
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:10.880]   just got married.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.240]   Maybe you're the only one left in kind of your squad,
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.640]   friend group, who's not married yet.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.000]   And you begin to be filled with sadness.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.440]   That's an emotion, the feeling of sadness.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.740]   What am I believing?
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.520]   Could be a number of different things.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.320]   But let's just continue with the illustration.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:33.120]   Likely what you value is getting married,
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:38.280]   and staying up with the stage of life your friends are in.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.980]   You're like, oh man, I don't wanna be behind.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.040]   Everybody else is kinda moving on with their life.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:45.100]   I'm just 33 and single, it's moving on for me.
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.320]   So that's the thing that you value,
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.280]   and the belief you have could be any number of things,
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.060]   but likely it's something like I believe,
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.060]   and I'm afraid that I may always be single.
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.840]   Maybe you're sad 'cause you're like,
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.220]   I think God is punishing me for my past.
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.380]   Maybe you think, man, I should've married him,
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.360]   that one that got away, because there's an intersection
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.280]   of what you believe and what you value.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.640]   Every time there's a human emotion,
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.440]   it is connected to these two things.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.380]   Which is a very important thing.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.520]   If you are going to learn to fight, and battle,
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.960]   and win in the human emotion,
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.560]   it is gonna take place by doing this.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.380]   What's another example?
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.760]   Maybe you're at work, and your team is together,
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.880]   and they're asking for ideas for some new problem
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.680]   you're trying to solve, and you throw one out there.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.400]   The response you get is kind of like,
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.720]   anybody else have any ideas, or it's dismissed,
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.540]   or it's even like, that's a terrible idea.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.440]   You're gonna leave that meeting,
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.040]   and you're gonna feel emotion.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.800]   You're gonna feel embarrassed, and anxious
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.000]   over whether or not I'm gonna have a job here much longer.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.640]   Those are the emotions you're gonna feel.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.480]   And why?
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.640]   Because there's a belief and a value
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.640]   that is a part of those things.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.920]   You believe that you're anxious or embarrassed,
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.540]   that maybe, hey, I just ruined my shot,
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.040]   I'm not gonna get promoted around here,
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.260]   my boss thinks I'm incompetent or dumb.
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.280]   That's what you believe.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.080]   And you value your job, you value what your boss thinks.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.200]   You guys following me on this?
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.320]   Every single time that you experience an emotion,
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.940]   it is connected, even if it's a positive emotion.
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.520]   And the degree to which you experience that emotion
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.800]   is directly related to the degree of the emotion,
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.300]   or the degree of the belief and the value.
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:25.920]   The greater the value, and the greater the belief,
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.760]   or my perception of what's happening is,
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.880]   the greater the emotion.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.320]   So you go back to my child running in the street,
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.720]   just like from a squirrel to another child to my child,
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.300]   that ramps up my emotion.
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.860]   And the greater likelihood of belief that I have
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.920]   that there's a car coming fast will increase my emotion.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.760]   You guys following me on this?
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.320]   I know thinking caps are on.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.960]   If you checked out, come back in.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.200]   And know this, that if you're gonna experience freedom,
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.520]   it's gonna be related to you knowing,
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.480]   because the Bible says, it uses these words,
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.940]   your beliefs or your values, your beliefs and your values,
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:05.320]   are directly behind what your heart is expressing.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.560]   And that's why the Bible says you and I
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.820]   have got to learn to combat them with God's word.
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.480]   And I'm gonna tell you a story.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.800]   I'm gonna tell you a story.
