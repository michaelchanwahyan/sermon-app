[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:24.300]   How we doing?
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.140]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.360]   Come on, come on, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston,
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.720]   wherever you're at, tuned in, we're so glad
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.640]   you're joining us in this effort to change the world
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.620]   for the name and the fame of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.760]   And I wanna ask you this question up front today.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.760]   Why would you buy anything without trying it first?
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.360]   Especially in this day and age, right?
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.160]   You can try something before you financially commit to it.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.080]   And this isn't even really advice,
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.260]   like this is just the air we breathe,
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.880]   like this is what we do, okay?
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.600]   Companies are capitalizing on this idea
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.340]   that you can try before you buy, right?
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.640]   Warby Parker, if you want some glasses,
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.040]   you can reach out to them, they'll send you five pair
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.980]   to try out, you can see what you look like in 'em,
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.120]   you can keep the one you want, you can send the rest back.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.000]   Okay, this is not unique to them.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.520]   Grocery stores are picking up on this.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.760]   You can go in, you don't have to deliberate
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.520]   over which hummus you're gonna get this time
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.120]   and you don't, you know, how does it taste?
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   'Cause I can't taste through the container.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.020]   At Whole Foods, you can actually go to them,
[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.480]   I read this, and ask them, hey, can I try this product out?
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.320]   Can I sample it?
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.320]   There's some rules around it, but you can try
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.040]   before you buy in grocery stores, right?
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.160]   There's a mattress company out there
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.140]   that says, you know, it's not just this guarantee,
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.640]   it's not like, hey, buy it, test it out, you can return it,
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.600]   but Novusbed says they will give you a mattress
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.560]   without you purchasing it for 120 days.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.280]   And then after 120 days, you can return it
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.880]   or you can buy it from them,
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.920]   or you can exchange it for a different one.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.440]   There's a company out there with appliances, perch.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.160]   You can go into their showroom,
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.800]   you can take your dirty clothes with you
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.180]   or some dirty dishes.
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.160]   You can try out a dish washing machine,
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.560]   you can try out a washing machine, a dryer.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.880]   You can try out their appliances before you purchase them.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.640]   Here's some advice.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.880]   Before you financially commit to anything,
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.520]   especially if it's a big purchase,
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.200]   I would personally encourage you to try it out.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.420]   The biggest one out there is, you know,
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.000]   that we talk about a lot is a car.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.260]   You can test drive a car.
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.240]   Why wouldn't you test drive a car
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.480]   before you make a purchase that big?
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.960]   I was interested in a car once, several times,
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.000]   but on this one particular occasion,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I saw a car was a great deal, it was on Craigslist,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.120]   I reached out to the individual
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.560]   and as I was talking to him on the phone,
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.840]   he was so excited.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.480]   He said, hey, you've gotta drive it.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.720]   If you drive this car, you're gonna buy it.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.840]   I knew the price was right.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.680]   I saw that it was cheaper than others on there.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.860]   And so he said, man, I just gotta get you
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.240]   behind the wheel of this car.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.080]   I said, okay.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.300]   He was so eager that he actually showed up here.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.040]   This was years ago, I just started working at Watermark
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.680]   and he shows up with the car.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.280]   I get in, I'm driving it down Park Central,
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.480]   this curvy road here.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.880]   It had the Triptronic shifter, you know,
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.540]   it can shift on the steering wheel.
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.240]   It handled well, it was a really comfortable,
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.800]   fast, fun car, the price was right and I bought it.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.320]   And I loved it, I enjoyed that car for about a month.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.900]   About a month into it, my wife calls me.
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.360]   She says, there's a police officer here.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.840]   The Department of Motor Vehicles has sent over
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.960]   a police officer and they are asking me about your car.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.920]   I thought, oh no.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.360]   I got, I was a member of cinema desk, I got in the car,
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.680]   I drove over there as quickly as I could.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.840]   I got there, they said, sir, do you own this vehicle?
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.680]   I said, yes I do.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.540]   They said, not anymore, it's stolen.
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.240]   I said, it can't be stolen.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.160]   I said, the guy had the title and an ID and everything.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.920]   They said, it's a fake ID.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.080]   He purchased the car under false pretense
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.920]   with a fake cashier's check.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.180]   It was not his vehicle to sell you.
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.940]   It's a stolen car and they left with my vehicle
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.660]   on the back of a tow truck.
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.580]   Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.940]   of dollars down the toilet.
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.020]   Which is what brings me to what I wanna talk to you
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.980]   about this evening.
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.080]   Is the reality of it, that was not his to sell me.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.480]   And so as we talk about this idea of trying before you buy
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.920]   as it relates to sex or as it relates to your body,
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.740]   that's the problem with the advice.
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.900]   It ain't yours.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.900]   It's not yours to give away.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.900]   It was entrusted to you by God for a purpose.
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.240]   And if you do anything with that body that he loaned to you
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.780]   outside of his purpose, it's abuse.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.060]   It's abuse.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.760]   And so this is the problem with this advice
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.760]   that's not even advice, it's just the world we live in.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.240]   Nobody's telling you this, they just expect it of you.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:36.640]   It's like we have this neighbor family.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.200]   You see this couple, they got their act together,
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.760]   they're clean cut, straight laced.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.200]   Your friends kinda make fun of them
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.000]   'cause they never really go and get drunk
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.160]   and they're not wild and they're just kind of
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.400]   like this really straight laced family.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.200]   But as you look into it, you realize
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.120]   it seems like they have a really healthy marriage,
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.140]   like they love each other, like they really enjoy each other.
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.360]   And they're pulling you aside
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.120]   and they start their day in God's word
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.360]   and they pray before meals
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.960]   and it just seems like they love God
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.040]   and they go to church together and they pull you aside
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.580]   and they say, yeah, you really should pursue purity
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.760]   and you blow it off as old fashioned advice.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.840]   But then you've got this crazy uncle.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.680]   He's been married three times, he loves to party,
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.800]   he's got a stack of porn magazines on the coffee table
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.120]   and he pulls you aside and he's like,
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.400]   hey, listen, you wanna try before you buy.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.400]   And for some reason, we take advice from the crazy uncle.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.920]   It's bad advice, why do we do it?
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.560]   We're in this series called Bad Advice.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.440]   Tonight we're talking about this idea
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.000]   of trying before you buy as it relates to sex.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.640]   It's also like, hey, it's just sex is what they might say
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.440]   or hey, wait until you're ready, what does that even mean?
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.800]   I've been ready since the fifth grade.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.400]   I mean, who's not ready to have sex, right?
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.520]   And so I was talking to this guy who has this marriage
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.640]   that I really respect, kind of like that neighbor
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.120]   I talked about a moment ago.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.320]   He said he's one of the most godly men I know,
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.720]   one of the most God-fearing men I know.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.200]   He travels and talks about marriage,
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.040]   his marriage is that healthy.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.440]   He loves God, he loves Jesus.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.160]   And we were talking once and he just said,
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.320]   you know, JP, you and I talk about sex very differently.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.080]   And I said, well, what do you mean?
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.440]   I'm listening because this is a man I really respect.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.760]   And he says, I just like sex.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.560]   I haven't, he said this, he goes,
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.000]   I haven't had sex with my wife in 17 years.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.640]   And I thought, oh no.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.840]   Can I pray for you?
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.000]   I don't know what to do.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.120]   And then he goes on, I realized I misunderstood him.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.320]   Then he goes on to say,
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.720]   sex is what dogs do on the side of the road.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.640]   He said the intimacy that we experience,
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.520]   the closeness and the oneness that happens
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.640]   when we do that act that God created,
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.200]   that he gifted to us,
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.600]   I can't even call it what the world calls it.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.280]   See, some of you, your biggest fear tonight
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.800]   is that you'll never have sex.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.160]   That's not your biggest fear.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.480]   That shouldn't be your biggest fear.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.440]   Your biggest fear should be that you might only have sex.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.600]   That that might all, that might be the only thing you have.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.960]   And you never experienced the deeper intimacy
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.680]   that God has designed us for between two people
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.840]   when they come together in a place where there's no shame.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.840]   And it's holy and it's spiritual and it's deep
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.120]   and it's meaningful and it's gentle and it's kind
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.200]   and it's loving and it's patient and it's amazing.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.160]   And that's what I want for you.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.640]   So listen up.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.920]   We're gonna be in 1 Corinthians chapter six.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.120]   If you have your Bibles, please turn there.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.680]   I'm gonna show you some stats real quick
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.200]   that will kinda tell you from the world
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.400]   that this is bad advice.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.040]   The divorce rate, as you know, is around 50%.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.420]   It hovers there.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.640]   Couples though, however, when they get married
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.720]   and they're both virgins, that divorce rate of 50%
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.760]   goes down to 9%.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.400]   Do you think God knows what he's doing?
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.160]   I really wish I would've known this.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.480]   I wish someone would've told me this
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.240]   when I was in my early 20s or coming out of high school
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.360]   or really coming out of junior high.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.960]   I wish somebody would've told me.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.080]   If you wait until you're married, just you,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.100]   just one of the partners,
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.800]   your chances of divorce decrease by 70%.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.560]   Here's some stats on cohabitation.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.040]   That really is the nature of Try Before You Buy
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.980]   these days, that you would live together.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.040]   This comes from the US Attorney Legal Services.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.440]   Couples who live together are 250% more likely to divorce
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.480]   in the first five years of marriage than those who haven't.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.640]   90% of couples who live together don't get married.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.200]   Consider some of you who've lived together
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.960]   and you're no longer with that person.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.040]   80% of those that get married end up getting divorced.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.120]   Okay, here's what that means.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.160]   Those are fast statistics.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.320]   Let's just say there's 100 people up here.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.520]   They've all lived together before they were married.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.960]   We'll take 90 of them and we'll get rid of them.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.120]   They won't get married.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.400]   There's 10 left.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.560]   80% of those 10 will get divorced.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.360]   We'll remove eight from those 10.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.440]   There's two left.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.440]   Two out of 100 people will have a successful marriage.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.920]   Does God know what he's doing?
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.240]   How smart is the world?
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.520]   You're gonna keep taking advice from the world?
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.880]   Keep taking advice from your crazy uncle.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.740]   You can have a marriage just like him.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.280]   His first, second, third.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.200]   What are we doing?
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.420]   Try before you buy.
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:43.000]   Paul's going to tackle some bad advice of his day.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.120]   As we move through it, we're gonna talk about
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.560]   the purpose of sex, the power of sexual sin,
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.240]   and before you leave here this evening,
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.480]   the price of healing.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.580]   And so what's going on is he's writing this letter
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.560]   to the church in Corinth.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.620]   There's over 1,000 temple prostitutes
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.360]   because of the goddess Aphrodite.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.160]   She has a temple there in Corinth.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.040]   So you go to church, you can have sex with a prostitute.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.000]   He's writing into that culture.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.640]   There's this other phenomenon going on.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.460]   It's an overcorrection that they say,
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.980]   well, sex is physical and only the spiritual is good,
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.320]   and so sex is bad.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.240]   So he's trying to address to them that sex is not bad.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.160]   Sex is good.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.680]   It's a gift from God, but you shouldn't have it
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.000]   with people that you're not committed to in marriage.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.880]   And so he writes this in verse 12.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.160]   I have the right to do anything, in quotes, you say, he says.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.880]   This is a popular saying at that time.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.280]   This is bad advice.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.320]   People are going around, hey, man, do whatever feels good.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.160]   Do whatever you want.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.040]   Follow your heart.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.120]   I have the right to do anything, you say,
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.440]   but not everything is beneficial.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.440]   He's saying, man, that's bad advice.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.040]   Choices have consequences.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.060]   I have the right to do anything, in quotes,
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.040]   but I will not be mastered by anything.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.320]   There are things that you do that you can't stop doing.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.880]   There are things you wanted the freedom to do,
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.480]   but then you don't have the freedom to stop.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.160]   You get trapped, you get stuck.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.680]   You say, again, bad advice, food for the stomach
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.200]   and the stomach for food, and God will destroy them both.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.800]   This is the bad advice of that time.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.640]   He's writing this.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.760]   It's still bad advice today.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.780]   He's saying, hey, you eat whatever you're hungry for.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.420]   You do whatever feels good.
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.800]   You do whatever seems right.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.080]   Even though the Proverbs say there's a way
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.160]   that seems right to a person,
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.520]   but in the end it leads to death.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.640]   He's saying, hey, there are things that you eat
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.400]   that will ultimately destroy you.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.440]   All right, we know this.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.480]   We've learned this one.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.160]   When you're little, like you want ice cream
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.360]   for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.200]   Anybody love ice cream?
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.020]   I love ice cream.
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.080]   Blue Bell, I'm all about it.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.360]   Yeah, okay, but you probably didn't have it today
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.640]   for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.520]   You learned that.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.920]   It's not wise when you're a freshman
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.840]   and you gain 15 pounds.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.960]   It wasn't wise, right?
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.760]   They're like, hey, I'm not gonna do that.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.360]   We know that that's not smart.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.600]   Even though it tastes good, even though you enjoy it,
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.280]   hey, I'm not gonna do that.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.040]   My in-laws, they love Golden Corral.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:01.880]   Pray for them.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:06.360]   So I've been with them.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.440]   I gotta say, it's a tremendous value, the Golden Corral.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.240]   And there's always this family.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.480]   I don't mean to be mean or insensitive,
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.840]   but there's this family there,
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.160]   and they're piling up the dessert,
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.500]   and they're clearly unhealthy.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.760]   They're destroying themselves,
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.160]   and they're going through the buffet line
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.240]   and just heaping it up, getting plates and plates,
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.360]   and it's like, man, you need a friend.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.840]   You need someone to come alongside you
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.800]   and say, that is destructive.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.400]   And this is what Paul is saying.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:43.000]   No, the stomach is for food,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.120]   but not to eat whatever you wanna eat
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.480]   whenever you wanna eat it.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.020]   And in the same way, if you say,
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.980]   well, I have an appetite for sex,
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.080]   so I'm just going to pursue release,
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.600]   that is foolish and ignorant,
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.600]   and not what that hunger pain is meant to be satisfied by.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:09.980]   The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.760]   before the Lord, and the Lord for the body,
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.120]   by his power, God raised the Lord from the dead,
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.080]   and he will raise us also.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.440]   You wanna know if God cares about your body?
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.920]   He cares about it so much, he's gonna preserve it
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.360]   and carry it into eternity.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.040]   Do you not know that your bodies
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.060]   are members of Christ himself?
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.640]   Your body, it belongs to Jesus.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.760]   Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them?
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.320]   That word unite them is literally glue them,
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.880]   stick them with a prostitute.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.800]   Never, he writes, do you not know that he
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.640]   who unites himself with a prostitute,
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.840]   this word for prostitute, it is any person
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.520]   that you would have sex without a marriage,
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.240]   check me on that.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.440]   In the Greek, we translate it prostitute.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.680]   In the earliest translations, hey, this is someone,
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.840]   but it's not someone you would pay for to have sex with.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.040]   It's someone that you would have sex with
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.480]   that you're not in a covenant relationship with.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.480]   Do you not know that he who unites himself
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.560]   with a prostitute is one with her in body?
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.000]   For it is said, the two will become one flesh.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.200]   This is design talk, Paul is saying.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.080]   He's saying, hey, this body was given to you,
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.960]   it was designed to you, it was designed by a person,
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.720]   it was designed by a deity.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.120]   It had a designer, and something is happening
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.960]   that you don't fully understand.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.460]   When you go through this act, we call sex.
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.160]   But whoever is united with the Lord
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.180]   is one with him in spirit.
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.400]   Paul is going to great lengths to say,
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.720]   hey, there's not a separation from your body
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.320]   and what is spiritual.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.120]   Your body is spiritual, and what you do
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.040]   with your body is spiritual.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.680]   You can't avoid that.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.840]   God has a purpose for your body,
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.680]   so before you go doing something with it,
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.200]   you should consult with him.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.920]   And so my first point today is the purpose of sex.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.040]   We're gonna talk about the purpose of sex,
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.600]   that God is the master designer of sex.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.720]   And so if you wanna understand how to do something,
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.020]   there's a couple ways that you can learn about it.
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.020]   One is you can talk to someone who's done it a lot.
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:10.960]   But practice doesn't always make perfect, right?
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.380]   If it did, if we thought, hey, you know,
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.120]   the person who's the best at this act
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.360]   is the one who's done it a lot, is we're all,
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.000]   then we're gonna be looking for the person
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.400]   who's had the most sex, who's had the most partners,
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.320]   we're gonna say, that's who I want as my spouse.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.680]   But nobody thinks that way.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.160]   Okay, so then you could talk to someone
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.520]   who's really good at it.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:35.440]   But this good at it is also confusing
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.800]   because our culture has dumbed it down to technique.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.680]   And there are people who claim to be great lovers
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.640]   who have miserable marriages and multiple marriages.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.640]   So there's gotta be something more to this technique.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.740]   What we do not understand, what we failed to realize
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.180]   as a culture in 2017 is sex is spiritual.
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:59.320]   That it's a spiritual act.
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.680]   And so why not talk to the one who made it?
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.280]   That's what you can do if you wanna learn
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.120]   a lot about something is you can talk
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.180]   to the one who invented the act.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.520]   God, he's pro-sex.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.400]   He's all about it, it was his idea,
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.400]   it was his genius, glorious, amazing idea.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.960]   Father, Son, and Spirit, I don't know if they had
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.800]   a whiteboard or what, I imagine they didn't have
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.640]   a whiteboard, they didn't need one.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.980]   But they're just like, what if we did this
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.200]   and this is how we brought life in?
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.480]   Like, that's a great idea.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.260]   We'll make it feel good, it's gonna be awesome.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.100]   How do we do that?
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.200]   Well, we'll make the man like this and a female like this
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.800]   and this part will fit there, it's genius.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.380]   I was gonna get so much more awkward than that,
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.340]   so buckle up, okay, we're just getting started.
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.200]   Let me just show you that God is pro-sex.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.440]   I'm gonna read to you from the Bible, okay?
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.680]   This is Song of Solomon, chapter seven.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.720]   It's a man talking to a woman.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.680]   Your stature is like that of a palm
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.800]   and your breasts are like clusters of fruit.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.400]   I said I will climb the palm tree and take hold of its fruit.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.800]   Try not to do things with my hands.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.640]   May--
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.900]   [congregation laughing]
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.680]   May your breasts be like clusters of grapes on the vine.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.880]   The fragrance of your breath like apples
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.200]   and your mouth like the best wine.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.560]   And then she responds,
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.800]   may the wine go straight to my beloved
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.840]   flowing gently over his lips and teeth.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.180]   I belong to my beloved and his desire is for me.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.280]   I'll stop right there so you can sleep tonight.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.560]   But it goes on in tremendous detail
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.200]   talking about how incredible
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.120]   it can be between two people who love each other.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.680]   When they celebrate this gift that God gave us,
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.240]   he's pro-sex, he invented it,
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.560]   he made us for it.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.480]   He designed us for it.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.120]   He made the parts, not just the way they work,
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.800]   the way they do, but he also put the nerve endings
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.040]   where he did so that it would feel the way that it does.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.220]   It was all God's genius plan.
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:00.940]   It's his design.
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:05.040]   And so a man has a sexual organ
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.680]   which places a seed inside a woman's sexual organ
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.760]   that fertilizes an egg so that a life is born.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.440]   How stinking genius is this?
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.060]   That this is how we would cover the earth
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.640]   with God followers.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.120]   That life would be brought when two people
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.320]   who love Jesus come together
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.880]   and they celebrate this gift from God,
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.760]   life is brought forth.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.660]   And children, God says, are a blessing,
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.840]   but we don't always see children as a blessing, do we?
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.480]   Sometimes we see them as an inconvenient.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.400]   And so God in his genius ways,
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.800]   thousands and thousands and thousands of years ago,
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.720]   said, you know what, we better make this act feel good
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.700]   so that they will bring this life forth.
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.000]   Because if it didn't feel good,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.880]   like if sex felt like a spinal tap,
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.880]   we probably wouldn't have kids, right?
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.420]   And the human beings would probably die out.
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.040]   God's genius plan.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.400]   Do you know the first command that God gave human beings?
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.140]   In Genesis chapter one, verse 28,
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.100]   God made them male and female,
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.640]   and then he says this, have a lot of sex.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.780]   That's the message version.
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:24.780]   He said, be fruitful and multiply.
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.440]   Be fruitful and multiply.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.380]   Have a lot of children.
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.520]   This is my plan for covering the earth
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.120]   with people who love me.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:36.260]   I want you to do this act a lot and bring forth life.
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.100]   And so this feeling good, it does something.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:45.560]   But God didn't just make the parts the way that he did
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.180]   and made it feel the way that it does.
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.720]   He wired it into then our brains
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.600]   so that whenever we experience,
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.740]   I need you to hear this, okay?
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.060]   And I need you to tell people 'cause this is not taught.
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.380]   Whenever we experience that act,
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.500]   and we specifically, we experience the climax of that act
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.540]   or release or orgasm,
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:12.100]   what happens is our brain releases dopamine.
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.220]   Dopamine is what makes you feel good.
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.820]   It gives you a euphoric feeling, a sensation.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.680]   It's the highest levels of dopamine
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.060]   that can naturally be released in a person
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.740]   is through the act of sex and specifically the climax.
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.840]   This is why people will give their lives to it.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.560]   This is why you felt like something fun
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.760]   has been kept from you.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.080]   Like God's trying to keep something from you.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.600]   He's not, there's a design around it.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.480]   That act, what happens then
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.720]   when you experience that feel good cessation
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.960]   is your brain creates what's called a synapse.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.560]   A synapse is like a muscle, almost like a memory muscle.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.600]   What that does is, this is important,
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.800]   is it bonds your five senses to your surroundings.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.960]   And there's all kinds of phenomenons around this.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.080]   Modern secular psychology calls this phenomenon sex glue.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.120]   That there's a person that will get
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.000]   so addicted to pornography,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.120]   they can't experience an erection without porn there
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.080]   because they've glued themselves
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.500]   physiologically to pornography.
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.880]   And so you can imagine, this is why he says
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.560]   in 1 Corinthians 16, the two will become one flesh.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.840]   He says they literally will become stuck together.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.920]   And so here's a visual for you.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.600]   It's gonna blow your mind.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.240]   You're gonna be like, whoa.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.360]   You ready?
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.960]   You ready for this?
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:40.800]   Two
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.880]   become one.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.100]   Boom.
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.080]   That just happened.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.240]   (congregation applauding)
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.400]   Stuck together.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.640]   Bonded.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.880]   What happens in that synapse, and this is important,
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.020]   I want you to remember this word, standard,
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:06.020]   is whoever you experience sexual release with,
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.440]   they become your standard.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.800]   This is so genius in the safeness of marriage
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.240]   that as her body changes and his body changes
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.320]   and they age, as they continue to come back together
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.320]   in this act, they become each other's standard.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.960]   The marriage is safeguarded, right?
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.040]   Other people can't come into that
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.400]   because they are each other's standard.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.840]   This is a real phenomenon.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.840]   It really happens.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.240]   It happens with that neighbor I was talking about earlier.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.840]   When they're the only two people that they've experienced,
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:42.500]   they are each other's standard, and it's safe.
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.400]   There's no shame there, no embarrassment.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.840]   You don't have to wonder if he's comparing you
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.560]   through the six other girls,
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.480]   or she's comparing you to that ex-boyfriend.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.640]   You don't have to wonder about that.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.040]   And this phenomenon, this is where those insecurities
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.620]   come from because when you try to pull it apart,
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:04.240]   it's destructive.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.640]   It's destructive.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:13.580]   And the shame creeps in, and the insecurities creep in,
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:17.480]   and the feelings of doubt creep in,
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.080]   and the questioning creeps in, and the wondering creeps in,
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:25.480]   and the marriage and the relationship is no longer safe.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.920]   This was God's genius design.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.540]   We've taken it, and we think we know better than the creator.
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:41.280]   This is pretty much a picture of my life 12 years ago.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:47.960]   Walking around in pieces, not even realizing it,
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.000]   celebrating the shame that happened
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.720]   because we've dumbed sex down to technique.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.960]   We're so worried about the honeymoon
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.320]   that we've traded the 20-year anniversary
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.720]   for a great honeymoon.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.000]   I know a lot of believing couples
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.400]   that don't even have sex on their wedding night.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:16.720]   I might dare to say that most, or close to most,
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.360]   don't even have sex on their wedding night.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.200]   And you say, man, that's crazy,
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.040]   I never even thought about that.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.560]   It happens, true.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.400]   Why?
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:29.920]   He's so gentle and kind and caring and patient.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.440]   They experience intimacy.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.480]   And maybe not even in that act on their wedding night,
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.320]   but they have the rest of their lives to figure that out.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:45.160]   And for them, it just gets better and more enjoyable
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.000]   and more worshipful.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.480]   And some of us will never have that.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:59.040]   In fact, if you wanna try something before you buy it,
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.600]   that is to inspect it, look for patience.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.200]   Look for their willingness to wait.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.000]   Look for their willingness to pursue purity
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.920]   because you know that person is gonna do
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.760]   whatever it takes to keep your marriage pure.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.720]   You know they haven't conditioned themselves
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.080]   to having sex outside of marriage.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.600]   I would look for that, I would lean in for that.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:25.160]   Look for the loving, kind, patient kind of person,
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.000]   the gentle kind of person.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.240]   And so sex, it's for procreation,
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.800]   and it's for bonding two people together in marriage.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.520]   It's not for pleasure.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.560]   God made it pleasurable to accomplish
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.800]   those two other things.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.720]   God, in his genius, kindness, and grace,
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.720]   made it feel good so that two people
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.200]   would be bonded together
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.920]   and that we would bring forth life.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.840]   And so what we do now, listen,
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.840]   we try to prevent pregnancy
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.520]   and we try to prevent the bonding
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.160]   while capturing the pleasure
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.380]   and we're left with a cheap activity.
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:04.280]   We're left with a cheap thrill, a cheap thing.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.560]   That's why he says, verse 18,
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.560]   "Flee from sexual immorality.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.080]   "All other sins a person commits are outside the body,
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:15.880]   "but whoever sins sexually sins against their own body."
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.080]   He says, "Run from sexual sin
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.460]   "because it will hurt you in a really unique way.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.800]   "All sin will cost you something."
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.880]   But Paul, the Holy Spirit through Paul says,
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:29.020]   "This one is going to cost you in a unique way.
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.660]   "It has a higher cost."
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.400]   Second point, the power of sexual sin,
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.040]   the power of sexual sin.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.720]   Sexual immorality, that is sex, outside of God's design,
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.280]   impacts us emotionally, physiologically,
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.600]   physically and spiritually.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.720]   And so consider how difficult it is
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.360]   to heal from sexual abuse.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.440]   Would everyone here say,
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.520]   it's gotta be difficult to heal from sexual abuse?
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.480]   Can I get a head nod on that?
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.880]   It's gotta be difficult to heal.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.460]   Abuse is defined as misuse.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.580]   Anything that's done outside of design.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.720]   So the vast majority of us tonight
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.040]   have endured some sort of sexual abuse.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.520]   That is sex outside of God's design.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.000]   That means the vast majority of us tonight
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   are in desperate need of healing.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.360]   And that's your application for tonight.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.840]   You have to pursue healing.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.760]   And we're gonna talk about how.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.120]   But that's what I want you to leave with.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.540]   You've gotta pursue healing.
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:37.240]   And so masturbation is a type of sexual abuse,
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.020]   oral sex, sexting,
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.780]   any kind of sex outside of God's design.
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:46.100]   And so if God created sex to bond us to someone,
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.960]   consider what happens when we bond to multiple people.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.600]   We train our bodies not to be sticky.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:58.000]   We train our brains not to attach to someone.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.980]   We've taken that and we begin to rewire us.
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.800]   The average millennial has eight sexual partners
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.640]   before marriage.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.000]   Here's a visual aid for you,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.540]   some Lego people, all right?
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.960]   And so if this is his and this is her sexual partner
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.380]   and they come together, right?
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.320]   It's not sticky.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.640]   I know.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.700]   Your minds are blown right now.
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.540]   You're like.
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:24.380]   This is what you're gonna,
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.420]   but just think about it.
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.360]   Think about this.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.860]   You are rewiring yourself
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:35.340]   when you take that outside of God's design.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:40.100]   You're retraining yourself.
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:44.260]   You're taking something that God created to protect you
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.060]   and you're using it in a destructive way.
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:54.720]   Do you remember what I said that whoever experiences,
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.380]   whoever we experience sexual release with,
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.500]   they become our standards?
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.180]   And so imagine what happens when we introduce pornography
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:03.220]   into the picture.
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:09.520]   16 clicks of airbrushed perfection into the picture
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.180]   that that would become our new standard.
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:17.020]   Imagine the problems that we run into then, right?
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:21.580]   There is no satisfying a porn addict.
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:28.120]   There is no way that you are going to fulfill
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:35.640]   someone who has gone through a university
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:39.080]   of training themselves meticulously
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:43.680]   toward multiple partners in adultery over and over and over.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.880]   And we may not know each other,
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.460]   so you may be like, man,
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.200]   preacher boy's coming down strong, heavy handed.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.040]   That's my story.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.880]   I speak from experience.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:57.160]   I've met hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of porn addicts.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:01.000]   I've never met anyone as struggled as much as I did.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.720]   Not because I think I'm terminally unique,
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.720]   I just know how sick and depraved my mind was
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.520]   before Jesus Christ.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.360]   And when I was introduced to this at an early age,
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.360]   I tasted something that was good.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.840]   And then I had the freedom of the internet in my own house.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.180]   And I could go through click after click
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.160]   after click of perversion,
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:26.020]   slowly and meticulously rewiring my brain
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.600]   so that when I got married,
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.840]   there is no possible earthly way
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.620]   that any human being woman was going to satisfy me.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:41.700]   And so I spent the past decade in recovery
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.440]   so that I can love her in a way that honors God
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.780]   and honor God with my body as the scripture commands.
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.680]   And it wasn't just the pornography,
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.200]   but it was relationship after sexual relationship
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.960]   after sexual relationship.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:02.440]   But there's healing.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.700]   That's what I want you to know.
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.600]   There's healing.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.240]   You're not left hopeless.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:12.760]   The only person who won't find hope
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.300]   is the one who leaves here and doesn't look for it.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:21.920]   God wants to restore you.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.440]   He wants to help you.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:29.440]   I thought I would struggle with pornography
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.480]   until I was married.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:34.220]   The struggle became the most difficult to manage
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.460]   after marriage as a believer.
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.860]   It felt like Jesus wasn't working.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.380]   I'm like a dog to his vomit.
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.120]   I'm running back to these things
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.440]   that are slowly destroying me.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.520]   And I'm like, Jesus, I thought you were gonna save me.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.040]   I thought you were gonna help me.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.480]   Like I thought I'd come to you and you clean up my life.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.840]   And I didn't realize that my sin had consequences
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.800]   that I had to sit in, that I had to heal from it.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.280]   Took time, right?
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.400]   And so yes, those wounds will heal,
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.520]   but you'll be left with scars
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.000]   at least until you get that renewed body,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.360]   that glorified body.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.840]   I don't wanna misrepresent anything to you tonight.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.840]   I cannot remove all of the consequences of your sin
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.260]   here on this earth.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:19.580]   There will be consequences to your choices,
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.080]   but they will be prolonged if you leave here
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.260]   and you do not pursue healing.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.640]   Jesus can heal your wounds.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.840]   You know, all kinds of wounds.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.740]   One in four of you tonight has an STD.
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.240]   One in four.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.240]   A lot of you don't even know it.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.720]   And I can't make those go away.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.120]   Some of you've had abortions.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.440]   I cannot undo that.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.620]   I can point you to the grace of God
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.520]   and I can show you how to take that mess
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.740]   and make it a message and help heal others
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.180]   and have God turn it into a ministry,
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.460]   but I can't undo that.
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.140]   I can't erase those images,
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.580]   the hundreds of images you've slowly fed your heart
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.300]   through your brain, through your eyes.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.340]   I can't make them go away.
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:08.540]   I can't make you a virgin again.
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.580]   And I wouldn't trust anyone who says they can.
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.720]   That's crazy.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:16.100]   But I can give you hope.
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.260]   But I can give you hope.
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.260]   And the best thing for being a really great lover
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.660]   isn't practice, it's purity.
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:31.340]   The best thing to become a really great lover
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.740]   is not more practice, it's purity.
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:39.620]   Someone recently asked me
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.100]   if I ever thought about other women
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:47.500]   when I was with my wife, Monica.
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.100]   And I thought about that.
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:58.360]   And my answer surprised me in a really delightful way,
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.200]   the best kind of way.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.600]   I just said two wonderful words.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.100]   I said, not anymore.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.420]   Not anymore.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.020]   I know I used to have a Rolodex
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:13.260]   that my brain would spin through.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.220]   I'm ashamed to tell you, man.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.320]   Ashamed to tell you.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.960]   But 12 years of pursuing Christ,
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.640]   pursuing intimacy with Him,
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:27.860]   listen, I've had all kinds of sex.
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:33.900]   But I've never experienced anything as beautiful
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.400]   and as spiritual and as worshipful
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.180]   as what I have today.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.240]   And it just gets better and better and better.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.120]   And I'm not selling you a bill of goods.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.600]   I'm telling you the truth.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.020]   There is hope for you.
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:52.180]   But it starts with you pursuing healing.
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:55.520]   Why would you wait, man?
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.500]   Verse 19, do you not know that your bodies
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.720]   are temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you,
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.760]   whom you've received from God?
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.440]   You are not your own.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.200]   You were bought at a price.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.920]   Therefore, honor God with your bodies.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.920]   I want everyone to look down at their body right now.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.420]   At your own body, not your neighbor's body.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.920]   Look down at your own body, okay?
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.560]   You too, Fort Worth and Houston,
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.280]   everybody look down at your body.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.040]   That's not yours.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.860]   It doesn't belong to you.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.680]   You have it on loan, okay?
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.680]   You don't have to be happy with it
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.000]   or critical of it or anything.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.160]   It's not yours, okay?
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.360]   God gave it to you and He gave it to you
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.720]   for a really specific reason,
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.440]   that you would honor Him with it,
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:42.760]   that you would glorify Him in what you do with it.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.240]   It belongs to Him.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.700]   And so I wanna talk about the price of healing.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.740]   Before we leave here,
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.520]   let's talk about the price of healing.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.340]   So you have this body on loan, right?
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.900]   You would never loan something to someone else
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.340]   that was lent to you.
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.240]   Like if you have something that doesn't belong to you
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.220]   and somebody says, hey, can I borrow that nail polish
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.060]   or your car?
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.500]   And you're like, no, it's not mine to give to you.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.700]   And that's the mindset I want you to think
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.800]   before you give this to someone else
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.740]   or let someone else do anything with it.
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:15.600]   They need to consult the owner that is God.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.840]   Sex, it's an act of worship to Him.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.840]   And that's why the enemy is going after it.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.600]   He hates you.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.920]   He hates when people worship God.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.440]   And so he wants to take this act of worship
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.560]   and dumb it down to a momentary pursuit
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.860]   of fleeting pleasure.
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:38.720]   So he's after sex and he's trying to destroy it
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.000]   and redefine it and make it something
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.740]   that it was never meant to be.
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:47.020]   And so why not try before you buy?
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:49.940]   Because you're not buying anything.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.760]   You're not a product.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.080]   You are a human being.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:59.080]   You belong to God and you've been purchased by Jesus Christ
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.780]   and your body, it belongs to Him.
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.540]   And so if someone wants to do something with it,
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.780]   have them ask Him if they can.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.460]   Can you think of a greater buzzkill?
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.600]   Hanging out, you know, hey,
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.600]   you wanna go back to your bedroom?
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.780]   I don't know, why don't we ask Jesus?
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.560]   Watching this movie, you wanna lay down?
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:22.640]   Nah, let's pray about that for an hour.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.940]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.780]   Right?
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:32.460]   The price that God paid for your body is Jesus, His Son.
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.800]   The price that you pay for healing is purity
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.620]   and pursuing Jesus with everything you have.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.860]   Verse 20, "Therefore, honor God with your body."
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:45.120]   Listen, friends, if you feel like damaged goods right now,
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.560]   and I know a lot of you do, I'm so sorry.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.360]   I know so many of you.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.160]   You feel the condemnation, you feel the weight,
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.720]   the enemy, it's the lies he whispers.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.300]   I know, I know.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.640]   Talk to so many of you, I know you feel it.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.800]   If you feel like damaged,
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.000]   if you feel like you're ruined right now,
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.800]   I want you to know something.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.260]   You're in really good company.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.740]   We're all damaged goods.
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:12.680]   We've all been ruined by sin.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:18.840]   Those are the people that Jesus comes and He purchases
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.400]   and He pays for our sins.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.720]   That's the gospel, that all of your sins went on Christ,
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.600]   that you don't have to pay for your sins in eternity
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.680]   because Jesus did.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:33.200]   And you have the same inheritance as the spotless virgin,
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.800]   the lamb, the spotless lamb, the sinless Savior.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:41.800]   You have the same inheritance as Him through the gospel
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.300]   by trusting in Christ, His death and resurrection,
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.640]   and He delights in forgiving you.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.940]   No matter what you've done,
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.980]   no matter what kind of sexual abuse you've encountered,
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.100]   whether you've been abused or the abuser,
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.980]   He delights in restoring you.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:02.340]   He delights in taking your mess and making it a message
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:05.500]   that you might use it to set others free.
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.920]   He purchased us misfits to be His brothers and sisters
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.420]   in His kingdom.
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:12.080]   Your body, it belongs to Him.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.960]   And the goal this evening is not
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.360]   that you would simply not have sex.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.840]   The goal is that you would honor Him
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.160]   in everything you do with your body
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.280]   and you're gonna need help.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.780]   And so we're here to help you.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.400]   I want you to come in here this Monday.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.300]   There'll be over 1,000 people in this room.
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.480]   This Monday night at 6.30.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.120]   It's a ministry we call Regeneration.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.060]   And you know that as I've talked about porn,
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.400]   you've felt uncomfortably because you know last night
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.500]   or last week or last month,
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.880]   you went back to that website.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.580]   You know the website, you know the app.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:45.720]   You've been there, you've seen it,
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.300]   you've watched the videos, the clips,
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.440]   you've looked at the pictures.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.840]   You know the kind of pornography that you like.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.160]   You know your preference.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.500]   And I'm talking to you, you need help.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.380]   I've been there, you need help.
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.760]   And you're not gonna find restoration
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.240]   without pursuing help.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.000]   And so you show up this Monday night at 6.30.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.080]   You prioritize it.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.000]   If you have plans, I cancel them.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.440]   I would come in this room this Monday at 6.30.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.280]   And some of you, you need to mark your calendar
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.560]   six to 12 months out.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.340]   Go on your Microsoft Outlook.
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:18.140]   In six to 12 months, you write date again.
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:22.520]   And between now and then, you begin to incorporate
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.760]   a healthy study of God's word,
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.800]   a getting to know him, a daily prayer,
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.480]   community around you, belonging to a church,
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.480]   joining a church, becoming a member.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.600]   Remake your life in those six to 12 months.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.800]   Make Christ your greatest pursuit,
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.700]   that you would be stuck to him,
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.260]   that you would be united to him.
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:48.200]   Some of you, you need to confess your sexual sins.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.760]   You need to do that tonight before you leave.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.680]   You need to find someone with a black shirt on
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.840]   that says the porch Dallas.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:53.680]   You need to go up to him and say,
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.640]   man, I gotta talk to you.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.680]   You say, I gotta talk to you.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.000]   They're gonna know what that means.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.380]   And you just say, hey, I need help.
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:00.220]   Here's what's going on.
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.060]   Here's what I've done.
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.640]   Here's what I'm in the middle of.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.880]   It's gonna take a lot of courage.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.400]   It's gonna take some crazy courage.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.400]   You're gonna feel like you can't utter those words.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:16.240]   Listen, I just told thousands of you some of my junk.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.440]   And I pray that that emboldens you to do the same,
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.720]   that you would go up to someone and say,
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.680]   hey, I need help.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.980]   Others of you, you need to break up.
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.480]   You break up, get well, get back together.
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:32.040]   Don't try to do it together.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.520]   Take some time apart.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:36.120]   Say, hey, we need to pursue Jesus.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.960]   I pray you do it before you leave the parking lot tonight.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.360]   If it's a long distance relationship,
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.980]   call him and say, hey, I've got a date with Jesus.
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.980]   I need to push pause on this for a little while.
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.820]   And that's what you need.
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.400]   I'm not trying to make it awkward for you right now.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.480]   I know it is.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.260]   I love you.
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.260]   I want God's best for you.
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.480]   I want better than what you have for you.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.100]   It's my only motive.
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.920]   God is not trying to rip you off.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.140]   He wants to give you life
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.760]   so that you might have it abundantly.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.920]   And that's what I want to do as I read his word over you.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:16.040]   It's interesting that when they left with my car,
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:20.240]   I, you know, I scrambled.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.500]   I mean, I was out thousands of dollars.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.560]   Talked to an attorney friend.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.200]   They said, hey, you can go to court and try to fight for it.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.040]   So I did.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.280]   I went to court and showed up.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.920]   And judge says, hey, it's not your car.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.420]   Couldn't argue with that.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:39.560]   Even though I had paid for it, it belonged to somebody else.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:40.820]   I said, okay.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.160]   I left with my head hanging low
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.160]   and the insurance company called me.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.400]   And I had insured it immediately upon purchase.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.120]   And they said, hey, we're going to declare it a total loss.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.300]   We're going to cover it.
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.840]   Which I had never expected.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.600]   Cause I was just like, man, this is my foolishness.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.880]   Like this was my stupidity.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.540]   This was my mistake.
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.720]   I said, we'll cover it.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.120]   That's what happened at the cross.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.060]   Not that Christ is an insurance policy.
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:07.900]   He's not.
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.280]   And not that I would then go around.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.000]   Oh, wow, insurance is going to cover this.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.840]   I'm just going to go around buying stolen cars then.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:17.040]   You know, that would be stupid.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.760]   No, I thanked God for grace.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.900]   I thanked him that he was no longer counting
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.320]   that sin against me.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:27.480]   That I didn't have to pay for it any further with him.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:30.440]   And I moved on and I was committed to being wiser.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.400]   I was committed to doing things his way.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.200]   That's what I want you to leave here with.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.440]   Receive grace.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.820]   You don't need to leave with shame.
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:39.120]   Shame is the voice of the enemy.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.040]   Guilt is his language.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.520]   That's what he speaks.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.940]   Tell him right now, hey, shh.
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.640]   Shh.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.840]   I received grace.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.320]   I've been an idiot.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.300]   Done some stupid things.
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:57.040]   I played with things that didn't belong to me.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.920]   I looked at things that didn't belong to me.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.760]   I gave myself to things that were not mine.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.440]   God, I abused your daughters.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:06.440]   God, I abused your sons.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.760]   Thank you for grace.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.920]   Now would you restore me, give me courage to pursue healing?
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.660]   That's what I want for you.
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:20.200]   Do you not know your bodies are temples
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.640]   of the Holy Spirit who is in you?
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.280]   Whom you've received from God.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.400]   You are not your own.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.900]   You've been bought by a price.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:31.720]   Jesus, why not try before you buy?
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:32.800]   Jesus didn't.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:37.040]   He didn't, he just committed.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.120]   He just committed.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.400]   He just committed, he just purchased you, man.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:45.560]   Gave his life to purchase you, bought you, set you free,
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:50.600]   gave you eternity with him in his kingdom,
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:54.600]   set you up an inheritance with him forever and ever
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:58.120]   and ever in glory, no longer counting your sins against you.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.800]   It is to his delight that he forgives you.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.300]   Walk in that, man.
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:06.280]   Would you walk in that and be free?
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.760]   That's what I want you.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:10.960]   I want you to leave your junk in this room.
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.000]   You leave your junk in this room,
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.080]   you walk out those doors and you'd be free
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.920]   and be new and stop, be set apart.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.960]   Don't do things the world ways.
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.620]   Your crazy uncle is crazy, okay?
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.640]   God has something better for you.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.640]   Father, would you show us
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.800]   that you have something better for us?
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.720]   Thank you for this amazing text.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.480]   Thank you for the freedom that you offer us.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.600]   Thank you for forgiveness,
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.760]   the reality that your son paid it all,
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.800]   that he paid it all.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.400]   There's nothing left for us to pay for.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.900]   The bill's been taken care of.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.280]   Help us to find that restoration,
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.540]   that regeneration, that newness of life
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:02.780]   in the name of your son, Jesus Christ, amen.
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:12.780]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
