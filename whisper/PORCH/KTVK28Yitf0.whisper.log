[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.340]   "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.580]   He makes me lie down in green pastures, He leads me beside still waters.
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.500]   He restores my soul, He leads me in the path of righteousness for His name's sake.
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.180]   Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for you
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.180]   are with me.
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.520]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.200]   You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.880]   You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.520]   Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.920]   in the house of the Lord forever."
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.520]   Hey, what's up, Porch?
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.520]   How we doing tonight?
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.160]   Hey, if this is your first time here, my name is Timothy Atik, and I'm one of the teaching
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.520]   pastors here at Watermark on Sundays as well as here at the Porch.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.400]   I want to say hello to everyone in the room as well as everyone watching at a Porch Live
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.520]   location in different parts of the country.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.800]   So glad that you are tuning in with us.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.760]   And I know that there's people literally all over the world just sitting at their computer
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.920]   or watching their TV, watching the Porch with us right now.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.680]   And so I want you to know we see you, and we're so glad that you are joining with us
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.860]   tonight.
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.520]   We are in week four of a series where we have just been walking verse by verse through
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.860]   the most famous chapter in the entire Bible, which is Psalm 23, which we just heard.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.220]   And I'm so excited about where we are landing tonight in verse five.
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.300]   To set it up, I'll just share this with you.
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.480]   When I was in sixth grade, I was at Dallas Love Field Airport preparing to fly from Dallas
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.940]   to Austin, and my cousin, who was a single young adult man at the time, took me to the
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.420]   airport.
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.540]   And while we were in the airport, he asked me if I had something to write with, and I
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.340]   was bending down looking for something in my backpack to write with.
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.220]   And while I was doing that, my cousin, the reason I told you he was a single young adult
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.340]   was because it had been raining outside, and he had the umbrella of a single young adult.
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.760]   It was male.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.580]   It was an umbrella without a handle on it.
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.820]   It was just the metal end.
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.540]   It was super janky, but he just went ahead and used it.
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.960]   And as I was bent down looking in my bag, he threw the umbrella on the ground, total
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:39.680]   freak accident, it popped open, and that metal end shot up and hit me right in my right eye.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.740]   And I went into the bathroom, and I pulled down my eyelid, and there was this massive
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.340]   red abrasion on my right eye.
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.400]   And I was crying like crazy.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.980]   And my cousin didn't know what to do with me, so he just put me on the plane and sent
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.820]   me to Austin for his brother to deal with it.
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.660]   So when I landed, I cried the whole way to Austin.
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.900]   When I landed, my other cousin took me to the emergency room where they gave me eye
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.440]   drops in an eye patch.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.340]   And I will never forget this eye patch because it was blue with white felt on it and a picture
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.080]   of a Dalmatian dog.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.300]   I'm in sixth grade, people.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.720]   So I got the eye patch and a sign that said "Kick me" to put on the back of me for when
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.220]   I went to school.
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.500]   Nobody's crushing it in sixth grade with a Dalmatian dog eye patch.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:44.280]   But the result of that experience was that I developed what's known as an eye floater,
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.960]   which just means that I see black dots permanently in my right eye.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.660]   And for the first year of having it, I genuinely just thought that there was always a mosquito
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.580]   around me, like there was literally for a year.
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.280]   I'd be sitting there and I'd be like, and I could never get it.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.320]   And then I realized like this thing is here to stay.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.560]   And then that one dot got a few more dot friends.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.960]   And so now I kid you not, this has happened for decades now.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:24.340]   The world that I know is a world with black dots right here.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.820]   There's just a circle of black dots perpetually in my right eye.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.920]   As far as I know, the world we live in is a world with black dots right here.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.860]   That's the world that I know.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.720]   And I haven't done a bunch of digging into it to know if I can do something about my
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.720]   eye floaters.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.360]   As far as I know, there's nothing I can do.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.100]   And I've just accepted the fact that this is who I am.
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.600]   This is the way it's going to be.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.520]   And this will be my life.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.120]   Now, that's fine.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.160]   That type of mentality is fine when you're talking about seeing a few black dots in your
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.000]   right eye.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.400]   But it's not okay when you bring that mentality into the spiritual realm.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.680]   See the reality is that many of us live with brokenness in our lives in the form of sin.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.660]   And we believe the lie that, you know what, this is just who I am.
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.260]   This is just the way it's going to be.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.280]   This is the world as I know it.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.820]   And so many of us will go through life and we will believe a mentality that just is not
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.380]   congruent with who our Savior truly is.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.000]   And so many of us live with this corrupt operating system that just says, you know what, this
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.280]   is just who I am.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.760]   I'm just an insecure person.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.080]   You know what, I'm just an angry person because of all that has happened to me.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.880]   I just have a stronger sex drive than most other guys or most other girls.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.480]   That's just who I am.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.600]   I'm just not a disciplined person.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.520]   I'm just not a confrontational person.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.020]   I'm just an anxious personality.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.960]   I just feel better when I'm in control.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.620]   And so we allow that corrupt operating system to just quietly operate in the background
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.620]   of our lives.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:30.000]   And so that is why pornography just moves in and makes itself at home.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.040]   That's why many of us lie or exaggerate or tell half-truths to make ourselves look better
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.660]   than we actually are.
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.880]   That's why many of us will manipulate guy after guy or girl after girl to kind of get
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.880]   something from them to make ourselves feel better about who we are.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:56.980]   That's why many of us overeat or under eat or spend money that we don't actually have.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.480]   It's because we buy into this mentality of this is just who I am.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.220]   I'm just a stereotypical young adult.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.300]   This is just the world that I know.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.040]   This is just the way it has to be.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:16.320]   See, it's good for us to remember that we all have an enemy.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.560]   And the Bible refers to the enemy as the devil or Satan.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.080]   But Jesus gives the devil a title.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.560]   He's called the father of lies.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:37.240]   Peter refers to him as a lion, a roaring lion prowling around seeking someone to devour.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:46.800]   And what I need you to understand is our enemy's greatest accomplishment is getting us to accept
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.700]   defeat when Jesus Christ has already secured the victory.
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:08:00.240]   This is what is crazy, is we have an enemy and his greatest accomplishment is getting
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:08.880]   you and me to accept defeat when Jesus Christ has already secured the victory.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.320]   Well how do we accept defeat?
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.080]   Well we accept defeat in the form of acquiescence.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.080]   We acquiesce.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.280]   This is just who I am.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.720]   Change is not possible.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:28.160]   And the life that I know is a life where this brokenness will just exist.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:34.660]   As we step back into Psalm 23, we land now in verse 5.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.040]   And I just want you to see what verse 5 says.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.480]   Here's what it says.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:47.760]   King David is writing and he says, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies."
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.760]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.800]   He says, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies."
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:58.920]   The reason that you need to understand what's happening here is that this is actually a
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.900]   picture of a celebration of victory.
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.820]   And the reason that David says, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies,"
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:14.960]   the reason that David's enemies are there is because they have been conquered.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:22.160]   And so the enemies are forced to sit there at the feast and they have to watch David
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.920]   dine in triumph.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:32.160]   So that's the picture here, is that David is experiencing victory in the presence of
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.320]   his enemies.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.700]   And I believe that God wants you and I to experience the same thing.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:42.240]   I believe that God wants you and I to walk in victory.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.240]   Why?
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:48.600]   Because Jesus Christ already secured the victory for us through his death on a cross,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.680]   burial in a tomb, and resurrection from the dead.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.720]   So this is just a theology check.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.760]   So for those of you who kind of theologically geek out, let's just make sure that your theology
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.760]   is intact.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.200]   And for those of you who are like, "I don't even know what you're talking about right
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.200]   now.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.080]   Like, this is a good chance for us to all get on the same page."
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:18.240]   It would be completely inaccurate to say that Jesus will win one day.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:26.120]   It is actually inaccurate to even say Jesus is winning because the most true statement
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.640]   is Jesus Christ has already won.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.520]   He's already won.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.640]   Well how can I say that?
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.820]   Well listen to what the Apostle Paul says.
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:43.640]   In Colossians chapter 2 verse 15 he says, "And having disarmed the powers and authorities,
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.600]   he," that's Jesus, what did he do?
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.600]   He made a public spectacle of them.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.120]   Who are them?
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.940]   It's the powers and authorities.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.840]   He's talking about Satan and all of his demonic forces.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:03.840]   He's saying that Jesus made a public spectacle of our enemy.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.000]   How?
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Triumphing over them by the cross.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.840]   So when Jesus Christ went to the cross when he was crucified between two criminals, when
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.080]   he declared, "It is finished," what was finished?
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:24.000]   He was finished accomplishing God's will, reconciling a broken and busted humanity back
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.320]   to a perfect God.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:33.400]   But not just that, it was finished triumphing over Satan's sin and death.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.480]   Having a mockery of them.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.960]   So you need to know our enemy has already lost.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:45.200]   I said it a few weeks ago when March Madness was happening, but Satan now is just like
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.120]   the guy who's looking at the scoreboard and he knows he's already lost, but he's just
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.760]   going to foul as many times as he can on the way out.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.820]   But he's already lost.
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.720]   Every act now of our enemy is just the act of a sore loser.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.560]   And so here's what I want you to hear.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.220]   Don't miss this.
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.780]   If you're tuned out, tune back in.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.880]   All eyes on me right now.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.880]   Okay?
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:20.120]   Jesus wants victory to be a normal part of reality for everyone who calls upon his name.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.800]   Let me just say that again.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:30.040]   Victory can and should be a normal part of reality for every follower of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.040]   What am I saying?
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.040]   Here's what I'm saying.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.760]   I'm saying that victory means change is possible.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.420]   You and I can fight against sin and experience.
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:46.460]   We can take ground in our sin struggles.
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.220]   We can grow in Christlikeness.
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.080]   And so here's what I want you to think about.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.080]   Okay?
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.420]   If you're here tonight and you consider yourself a follower of Jesus Christ, here's what I
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.780]   want to just ask you to decide right now in your own mind.
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:07.080]   When you think about following Jesus, which word right now pairs better for you with following
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.760]   Jesus?
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.000]   Failure or victory?
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.880]   Like when you think about your journey with Jesus, when you think about your life right
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:21.440]   now, which word pairs better for you when you think about following Jesus?
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.400]   Failure or victory?
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.180]   If for you it's the word failure, that's okay.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.900]   I'm so glad you came tonight.
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:35.000]   This is actually a perfect night for you to come because failure doesn't have to be your
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.820]   final answer.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.200]   And so here's what I want you to know.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.580]   I want you to know that victory isn't just possible.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:50.840]   Victory has already been purchased through Jesus's death on the cross and resurrection
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.500]   from the dead.
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:57.720]   And so what I want you to know tonight as we look into Psalm 23, there's going to be
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:02.320]   three things that you need if you're going to want, if there's going to be three things
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.660]   that you're going to need in your life if you're going to walk in Christ's victory.
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.660]   Here they are.
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.100]   Number one, you're going to need God's sight.
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.160]   Number two, you're going to need God's strength.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.860]   And then number three, you're going to need God's spread.
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:24.040]   If you want to take a step towards victory, if you want to kind of abandon the broken
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.680]   and busted operating system that just says, "This is the way it has to be.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.680]   This is just who I am.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.140]   This is how my life is going to be," change is possible.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:37.840]   Victory is on the table for you tonight, but you're going to need God's sight, God's strength,
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.080]   and God's spread.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.160]   If you have a Bible, turn with me tonight to Psalm 23.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.760]   Psalm 23 is where we have been.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:52.080]   If this is your first time here, I'd encourage you to go back and check out the first three
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:57.680]   talks in the series, but we've been making our way just verse by verse through the Psalm.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.040]   And David says this in chapter 23.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.240]   He says, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.700]   He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.600]   He leads me beside still waters.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.020]   He restores my soul.
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:18.720]   He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.680]   Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for you
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.320]   are with me.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.320]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.760]   And here it is, verse 5.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.800]   "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.000]   You anoint my head with oil.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.320]   My cup overflows."
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.800]   The first thing you're going to need if you're going to walk in Christ's victory is you're
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.840]   going to need God's sight.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:51.840]   What I am talking about is I am talking about prescription lenses from God for your heart
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:56.400]   so that you can see God in yourself clearly.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:02.480]   I don't know if you saw the transition in the text, but in Psalm 23, for the first four
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:08.000]   verses, David is referring to God as a shepherd and he's a sheep.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.040]   But in verse 5, there's this pivot and David abandons the shepherd imagery and he picks
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.320]   up the imagery of God being a host.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:22.040]   So God is host and David is honored guest.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.080]   Here's why that's so important.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:29.560]   In the ancient Near East, hospitality was so much more than it is today in the United
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.560]   States.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.480]   Like in the United States, hospitality is just an elaborate charcuterie board with a
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.120]   mid-range bottle of wine.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.880]   Like it was so much more than that in the ancient Near East.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:47.780]   And if you came to stay with me in the ancient Near East, then here is what I was committing
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.880]   to do as your host.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:55.600]   I was committing myself, taking full responsibility for two things.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.440]   Number one, your safety, and number two, your satisfaction.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.880]   For the entirety of your stay, I was responsible for your safety and your satisfaction.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:10.080]   So for example, in the book of Genesis, there is this really weird and interesting story
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:16.800]   where these angels come to visit a guy named Lot in a town called Sodom.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:25.360]   And the people of Sodom are crazy and they want to get access to these angels to harm
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   them.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:34.040]   And Lot is willing to sacrifice the safety of his own daughter in order to protect the
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.700]   two angels who are his guests.
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.700]   Why do I tell you that?
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:42.880]   Well, it shows that in the ancient Near East, you took hospitality very seriously.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:49.200]   If you were the host, you were making a decision to take full responsibility for someone's
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.960]   safety, but not just that, their satisfaction.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.660]   So a host would bring out their best meals.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.040]   They would cook their best meals.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:03.520]   They would spare no expense because they took full responsibility.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.640]   So when David says, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies, I want you
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.600]   to see how David is seeing."
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.000]   He is seeing things how God sees them.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.560]   David looks and says, "God is host.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.440]   I am honored guest."
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:25.160]   Like David is being invited to eat at the king's table and the king is throwing a banquet
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.880]   actually for David.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:37.320]   And so the question that you need to answer is, is do you see life through God's sight?
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.500]   Do you have the right sight?
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:46.800]   Some of you guys, you wear contacts or glasses, like until you put your contacts in in the
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:52.780]   morning or until you put your glasses on, you cannot make sense of reality.
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.200]   Is that anyone in the room?
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:19:00.720]   Like you just, you might see blurry shapes, but otherwise you cannot make sense of reality.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:06.200]   Well, you need to understand when it comes to life in the spiritual realm, every morning
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.720]   that you wake up, you have a choice to make whether you're going to put on God's lenses
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.580]   or you're going to put on some other lenses that are being handed to you by your enemy.
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.200]   So I do have glasses.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.440]   I don't really wear them.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.200]   That's a longer story, but these are my glasses.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.620]   I've had them for about 13 years.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:29.320]   And so I only wear these at night when I'm driving.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:36.600]   But here's the reality, when I put them on, I can see clearly.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.760]   They're doing their job.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:43.500]   But today, Alex Hockett, a guy sitting right down here, he walked into the office I was
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.000]   in and he handed me these.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.520]   I was like, "Well, where did these come from?"
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.760]   He was like, "I don't know.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.600]   I just found them laying around."
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.160]   I was like, "Ew."
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:20:01.760]   But anyway, here's the reality.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:08.960]   When you put these on, life looks very different.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:16.360]   Like the world that I now know is a life through a very distorted lens.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:21.440]   And so you need to know you are either walking through life with a distorted understanding
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.880]   of reality or you are seeing things clearly, meaning you are seeing them through God's
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.880]   sight.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:33.560]   And each morning, you have a choice which prescription lenses you're going to put on.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:38.360]   So many of us, we wake up and we see life through the wrong lenses.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.960]   And so we wake up and you know what we say?
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.960]   We say, "You know what?
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:42.960]   I am a failure.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.560]   I'm probably going to fail again today.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.300]   God's disappointed in me.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:53.620]   God is watching me from heaven, hoping that I make better choices than I normally make.
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:59.640]   But the reality is, is that I'm just a stereotypical young adult and this is just who I am and
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:07.100]   this is just really how it's going to be and change really isn't possible."
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.900]   You have to choose whether you're going to live with those lenses or you're going to
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.740]   pick up God's lenses and you're going to put them on and you're going to see things more
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:21.620]   clearly and you're going to begin to see the reality that the one who already defeated
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:26.260]   Satan, sin, and death is your host.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:31.500]   He's your host and you are his honored guest.
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.700]   You're not a stereotypical young adult.
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.820]   You are a guest of the King.
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:42.300]   You're his beloved child.
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.940]   He loves you.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.100]   He's for you.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.500]   He takes responsibility for your safety.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.020]   Have you ever thought about God in that way?
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:58.780]   That because he is host, he takes full responsibility for your safety?
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:04.500]   He's already won and he wants his victory to be your victory today.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:09.420]   And it's not just that Jesus did something.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:14.100]   He is doing something today in your life.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:19.940]   Like I don't know if you noticed, but in verse 5 when it says, "You prepare a table before
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.420]   me in the presence of my enemies.
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.080]   You anoint my head with oil.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.660]   My cup overflows."
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:31.820]   All of the verbs belong to who in that verse?
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.380]   God.
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.620]   God.
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:41.340]   God is the one doing all of the activity in association with the celebration feast in
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.900]   the presence of David's enemies.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.100]   God is responsible for all of the activity.
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:51.260]   And yet so many of us wake up and we're like, "You know what?
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:59.180]   God's looking down from heaven and he's watching me hoping I make, I do the right thing.
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:07.960]   So I'm going to try hard for God and yet it's probably not going to go well."
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:13.300]   God already did something and God is doing something.
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:18.740]   That's why Paul in 1 Corinthians 10.13 is able to say, "No temptation has overtaken
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.740]   you.
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:20.740]   That's not common to me."
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.740]   And God is faithful.
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:22.740]   Watch this.
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:23.740]   Here's what God is doing.
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.140]   God is faithful.
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:30.840]   He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation, he will
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.680]   also provide the way of escape that you may be able to endure it.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.360]   Do you realize that?
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:45.240]   Anytime you're attempted, anytime you're attempted, God's like, "Hey, there's a way out."
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:49.020]   Like it might just flash into your mind, like for a split second, you're like, "No thanks.
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.960]   I'll do this."
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:56.320]   But there is always a way of escape because God is doing something and he is a good host
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.380]   who takes full responsibility for your life.
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.580]   You have to begin to wake up.
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:06.820]   Every morning you need to know you're going to wake up and you're going to be fumbling
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.820]   around.
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:12.260]   You're going to be feeling around for, "For what lenses am I going to put on today?"
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:18.800]   And you need to know that you have an enemy who's like, "This one."
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:28.000]   And so you have to wake up and you have to begin to see things through God's sight.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.100]   I battled pornography for seven years.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.100]   Seven years.
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:38.660]   Pornography was a big part of my story, especially in college.
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:42.560]   And there was a breaking moment in my life where God just reached in and said, "We're
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.580]   going to be done with this."
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.600]   And you know what it required of me?
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.720]   It required of me to wake up each morning.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.420]   I woke up and I began to pray the same thing over and over.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.880]   I began to wake up and I used to say, "God, I pray that today your standard of purity
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.840]   would become my standard of purity.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:07.100]   Lord, I pray that today you would fill me with your Spirit that I might bear the fruit
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.100]   of self-control.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:15.260]   And God, when I am tempted today, will you help me to see the way of escape and to take
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.700]   it?"
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:24.500]   And one day turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, months turned into years.
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:30.100]   But it started with waking up and putting on God's lenses.
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:34.220]   You're going to need God's sight if you're going to walk in Christ's victory, number
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.220]   two.
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.660]   You're going to need God's strength if you're going to walk in victory.
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.020]   You're going to need God's strength.
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.660]   David says, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies."
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:49.620]   Watch this, "You anoint my head with oil."
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:54.860]   Some of you young adults who are already into essential oils, like you claim this verse
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:55.940]   is like your life verse.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.700]   You're like, "Yes, God, you anoint my head with essential oils."
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:05.160]   It's not what it says.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:13.380]   But in the ancient world, a host might greet someone and anoint their guest with oil on
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.380]   their forehead.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:18.620]   And when they would do that, you know what it would do is it would create a glossy sheen
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:25.180]   on someone's face, it would change their countenance, and it might even give their body a fragrance.
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:30.300]   Figuratively speaking, to be anointed with oil, it carried the idea of God's blessing
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.860]   or favor.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:36.920]   So for those of you in the room who are familiar with the life of David, can you think of another
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.880]   time when David's head was anointed with oil?
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.420]   It was when he was a teenager and he was anointed as king.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:51.260]   And I want to draw a connection for you between oil and one other thing.
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:56.860]   First Samuel 16, 13 says this, "Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him," that's
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.540]   David, "in the midst of his brothers."
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:03.460]   Watch this, "and the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon David from that day forward, and Samuel
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.100]   rose up and went to Ramah."
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:10.420]   Here's what I want you to see, there's a connection even in the Old Testament between oil and
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.800]   the Spirit of God.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.740]   When David's head is anointed with oil, what rushes upon him?
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.580]   The Spirit of God.
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:23.420]   Oil was a symbol for the favor of God, and God's favor manifested itself in the Spirit
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:27.540]   of God rushing upon David.
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.900]   I want you to fast forward to today.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:34.700]   Jesus Christ has come, He has died, He has risen, He ascended into heaven, and who did
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.980]   Jesus send?
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:40.820]   He sent the Helper, the Comforter, the Counselor, the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:45.100]   If you put your trust in Jesus, do you know who lives inside of you?
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.140]   The Spirit of God lives inside of you.
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:54.820]   I cannot think of a better way that God can display His favor upon us.
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:28:00.820]   Can't think of a better way that our lives can be transformed, our countenances change,
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:03.180]   our character smells differently.
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:04.260]   Why?
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:11.180]   Than being anointed with the oil that is the presence of the Spirit of God living inside
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.940]   of us.
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:17.700]   Now the reason that I said that if you want to walk in Christ's victory, you're going
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.940]   to need God's strength.
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.220]   Here's why I said that.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.020]   Let me just, watch this, follow me on this.
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.540]   Watch the argument that I'm making.
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:35.020]   Listen to what Ephesians chapter 1 verses 18 through 20 say.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:39.980]   Paul says, "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:44.980]   the hope to which He has called you, the riches of His glorious inheritance in His holy people,"
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:53.260]   verse 19, "and His incomparably great power for us who believe."
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:59.260]   That power is the same as the mighty strength He, God exerted when He raised Christ from
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.660]   the dead and seated Him at the right hand in the heavenly realms.
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.060]   So do you see what Paul's saying?
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:09.420]   Paul is saying, "Look, as a follower of Jesus Christ, I want you to experience the power
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.740]   of God.
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:16.920]   It's an incomparably great power, and it's the same power that raised Christ from the
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.740]   dead.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.660]   Where does that power come from?"
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.740]   Romans chapter 8 verse 11, watch this.
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:38.420]   "If the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:43.140]   Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through the Spirit who
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.140]   dwells in you."
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.140]   So do you make the connection?
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:49.660]   Paul is like, "Look, I want you to know the power that raised Christ from the dead."
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.680]   And then he says in Romans, "You know what that power is?
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:56.020]   It's the Spirit of God, and that Spirit actually lives in you."
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:30:00.380]   So please don't miss what I'm telling you.
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:05.220]   If you want to walk in victory, then you have to get your mind around this.
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.000]   Don't miss it.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:16.820]   The same power that raised Christ from the dead is living inside of you right now.
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.180]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:24.540]   Like have you ever just made that mental shift and realized that the Spirit of God doesn't
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:29.380]   live in you passively?
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:36.060]   Like the Spirit has purpose in your life, and one of those purposes is for you to know
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:44.900]   the same power that raised Christ from the dead in a very personal way.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.700]   It's an incomparably great power.
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.600]   Nothing rivals it.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.620]   Nothing can stand against it.
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:57.380]   No addiction, no lies from the enemy telling you that you're a failure or you're worthless
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.500]   or you're never enough.
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:02.860]   No hurt, no heartache, no anger, no bitterness, no resentment.
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.980]   Nothing can stand up against the same power that raised Christ from the dead.
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:14.580]   That's why Paul is able to say in Galatians 5:16, "Walk by the Spirit, and you will not
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.760]   gratify the desires of the flesh."
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.780]   He's able to say confidently, "Look, walk by the Spirit."
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:26.380]   That word "walk" it implies a consistent dependence.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:31.660]   Walk by the Spirit, and I can confidently tell you, you will not gratify the desires
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.700]   of the flesh.
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.700]   You'll experience victory.
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:42.540]   I've used this illustration before, but several years ago I was watching this game show, and
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:47.780]   this game show, it was just a bunch of obstacle courses, so contestants would run these obstacle
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.780]   courses and compete to win.
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:57.220]   There was this one obstacle course, I'll never forget this, there was this point in the course
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:05.100]   where there were four different doorways, and the doorways were covered by paper.
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.700]   So the thought was that contestants would run and just kind of eenie, meenie, miney,
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.780]   moe the four doorways and pick one and run and burst through the paper and keep going.
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:23.900]   The only catch was that behind three of the four doorways were wooden beams.
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:34.420]   So what you saw was contestant after contestant run up, hope for the best, pick a doorway,
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:42.320]   burst through paper, and experience massive amounts of regret and shame.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:49.620]   But then I began to notice that there were a few contestants that figured it out, because
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:53.700]   when they got to that point in the course, instead of just kind of hoping for the best,
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.140]   picking one and going for it, you know what they would do?
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.020]   Is they would stop and just start staring.
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:03.700]   Because what they realized is if they waited long enough, the sunlight would hit the paper
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:11.300]   and illuminate which ways led to death and which way led to joy and peace.
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:21.340]   And I tell you that just to say the Spirit of God is the light that shines in our lives
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:25.140]   and makes known to us the path of life.
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:31.780]   And He's committed to leading us in the ways that lead to joy and peace.
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:41.380]   And He's trying to steer us away from the paths that will lead to shame and regret.
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.700]   That's what He wants to do.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:46.980]   He is resurrection power living inside of you.
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:50.780]   If you want to walk in Christ's victory, you are going to need God's strength.
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:55.900]   So let me just ask you, if you're in the fight right now, if you feel like you are fighting
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:00.660]   a losing battle, if the word failure feels like it connects more for you than victory,
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:05.780]   then let me just ask you, when is the last time you got on your knees and begged God
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.580]   for resurrection power in your life?
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:13.780]   Like when's the last time you said, "Holy Spirit, I know you live in me.
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:21.140]   I beg you for the same power that raised Christ from the dead to do something in me.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.780]   Change the way I think.
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.100]   Change the way that I operate.
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.740]   Change my desires.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:30.260]   Do a work in me.
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:35.900]   Regardless, would you give me the strength that I need today, the love, the joy, the
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:41.140]   peace, the patience, the kindness, the gentleness, the faithfulness, and the self-control today
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:50.380]   to walk on the path that is most glorifying to Christ because you live in me?"
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:55.180]   Here's what you need to understand, though.
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:58.540]   Walking implies consistent reliance.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.380]   It's not just a one-time deal.
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.580]   Like we're talking moment by moment.
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:09.340]   Ephesians 5.18 says, "Don't get drunk with wine, for that's debauchery, but be filled
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.340]   with the Spirit."
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.340]   That's what alcohol is doing.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.100]   He's saying, "Hey, look at what it's like when you're drunk.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.100]   What happens when you're drunk?
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.100]   You're controlled by alcohol.
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.780]   It affects the way that you think, the way you talk, the way you act."
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:23.180]   He's like, "Yeah, take that analogy and apply it to the Spirit.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:27.780]   You want to be controlled by the Spirit like alcohol would control a drunk person.
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.620]   You want to be controlled in such a way that it changes the way that you think, the way
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:33.580]   that you talk, the way that you act.
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:43.180]   But in order for you to be controlled by the Spirit, you have to relinquish control.
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:47.900]   And that requires surrender, where you wake up and say, "My way is wrong.
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.240]   Your way is right.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.240]   Your way is good.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.240]   My way is wrong.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.480]   Your way is the best way.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.020]   I will go with you."
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:02.920]   And then really the question you have to answer is, "Do you really want to change?"
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.860]   Think honestly, do you really want to change?
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:11.500]   Because if the Spirit of God goes to work and unleashes resurrection power in your life,
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:18.780]   it's going to be amazing, but things are going to change.
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.820]   And that might change what you do on the weekends.
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.100]   That might change your relationship status.
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.980]   That might change where you work.
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.580]   That could change all sorts of things.
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.740]   So the real question is, do you really want to change?
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:35.700]   If so, the good news is that you have God's sight and God's strength available to you
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.980]   today.
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.140]   But if you want to walk in Christ's victory, you don't just need God's sight and God's
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:45.020]   strength, you're going to need God's spread.
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.220]   What do I mean by God's spread?
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:48.940]   That feels a little weird.
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.140]   Here's what I mean.
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:55.900]   David finishes verse 5, he says, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.380]   You anoint my head with oil.
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.900]   My cup overflows."
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.460]   So the picture here is of a banquet feast.
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:08.000]   Just imagine the best foods, God's spread, like God playing the menu.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.040]   God made the food.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.040]   He brought it.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.860]   It's going to be the best.
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.540]   He says, "My cup overflows."
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:21.740]   It's just a picture of God continually topping off David's chalice so that David is constantly
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.060]   satisfied.
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:26.560]   He is always fully satisfied.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.060]   So here's what you need to know.
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:32.500]   If you want to go on the offense against your sin, if you want to go on the offense, then
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:38.020]   by far the best thing you can do is enjoy God and all of His provisions every single
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.560]   day.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.220]   Enjoy God and all of His provisions.
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:47.740]   It's to sit with Jesus and His Word every day until you have tasted and seen that He
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:48.740]   is good.
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.220]   Because here's the deal.
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:54.360]   The more you enjoy God, the more difficult it is to enjoy sin.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.660]   It is very difficult to enjoy God completely and enjoy sin completely at the exact same
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:06.260]   time because the more you realize that you have in God, the less you feel like you need
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.460]   from sin.
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.180]   But here's what you need to understand.
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.700]   You know what your enemy capitalizes on?
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:21.740]   Our enemy capitalizes on perceived need, perceived hungers.
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.540]   So you hunger to feel enough?
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.180]   Well compare yourself to others.
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:30.420]   Busy yourself to the point that you're too busy for Jesus.
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.620]   If you hunger for approval, this is a big one for me.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:40.820]   Then become who someone else wants you to be and stop being who God made you to be.
[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.860]   If you hunger for control, fine.
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.900]   Manipulate your friends and family members.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.620]   Manipulate your diet in an unhealthy way.
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:51.900]   Transform yourself, turn to pornography so that you can feel in control.
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:58.580]   If you hunger for love, choose lust, compromise, date the wrong guy or girl.
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.520]   It's easier that way.
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.780]   You hunger for security?
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.500]   Then don't trust God.
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.500]   Don't walk in faith.
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.940]   Accommodate all your fears in life.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.300]   You hunger for justice?
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:14.060]   Anger, bitterness, and resentment are your right.
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:19.820]   See, our enemy capitalizes on perceived hungers.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.380]   And here's the crazy thing.
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:32.140]   Our tendency is to run to the world looking for what we already freely have in Jesus Christ.
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:38.540]   Our tendency is to run to the world looking for what we already have freely in Jesus Christ.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:39.700]   I just want you to think about this.
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.620]   What's your favorite restaurant in Dallas?
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.820]   Okay, for me, my favorite restaurant is probably a place called Ucci.
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.440]   It might be a place called Hillstone.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.820]   Both of those that kind of go back and forth for me.
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:49.820]   Love both of them.
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.820]   Okay?
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:53.380]   I don't know what it is for you, but here's what I want you to imagine.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:57.580]   If I were to invite you over to my house for dinner, and whatever your favorite restaurant
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.300]   is, what if I told you, "Hey, I'm catering it in.
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.300]   I'm bringing it in.
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:05.420]   All of your favorite dishes, they're going to be this massive spread from your favorite
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:11.340]   restaurant that the place that you enjoy the most, I'm having it for you."
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:15.700]   Now can you imagine being at my house with your favorite meals in front of you, and you
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:21.980]   excusing yourself and going out into my alley and starting to dig through my trash looking
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.980]   for something to eat?
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:28.540]   Wouldn't that feel crazy?
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:35.740]   And yet we do it all the time in the spiritual realm.
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:42.740]   Yet we have everything our souls long for freely in the person of Jesus Christ, and
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:52.500]   yet we run to the world looking, digging through trash cans looking for spiritual scraps.
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:56.140]   And so let me just remind you of what the good news of Christianity is.
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:57.980]   Here is the gospel.
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:59.900]   The gospel of Christianity is this.
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:07.740]   Jesus drank the cup of wrath so that we could drink the cup of God's blessing.
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.260]   Jesus drank the cup of wrath.
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:12.820]   When He went to the cross, He was crucified for your sins and mine.
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:16.420]   He was punished for your sins and for mine.
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.420]   He drank the cup of God's wrath.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:20.860]   Why?
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:25.940]   So we could drink the cup of God's blessing, that we could know Jesus, and we could be
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:34.580]   satisfied by Jesus now and forevermore.
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:39.380]   If you're hungry for justice, Romans 12, 19 says, "Beloved, never avenge yourselves.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.420]   Leave it to the wrath of God, for it's written, 'Vengeance is mine.
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:44.340]   I will repay,' says the Lord."
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.340]   He's got you.
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:51.020]   If you hunger for control or security, Colossians 1, 17 says, "He, Jesus, is before all things,
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.420]   and in Him all things hold together."
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:58.060]   If you hunger for love, 1 John 3, 1 says, "See what kind of love the Father has given
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:02.860]   to us, that we should be called children of God."
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:09.060]   If you need to feel enough, if you're longing for approval, 2 Corinthians 5, 21 tells us,
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:15.260]   "For our sake He, God, made Jesus to be sin, who knew no sin, so that in Him we might become
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:16.740]   the righteousness of God."
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.500]   What does that mean?
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:23.460]   It means that the God of the universe would look at us and say, "You're enough, not because
[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:26.980]   of anything you've done, but because of what Christ has done for you.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:32.500]   He has made you enough when you could never be enough."
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:37.220]   You have all the enoughness, all the approval that you need in Jesus.
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:41.860]   And so one of the greatest misunderstandings when we feel like we're walking in failure
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:46.220]   is we look at God and we're like, "God, I need you to do more for me.
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.900]   I need more strength from you.
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.700]   I need more help from you."
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:58.220]   But here's the reality, you don't need more from God, you just need more of God.
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:03.180]   Because everything that you need, everything that your soul truly longs for, it's found
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.260]   in the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:11.460]   And here's the reality, if Jesus Christ cannot satisfy your soul, I assure you nothing else
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.380]   can.
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.260]   Just try me on that.
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:23.060]   If Jesus Christ cannot satisfy your soul, I promise you nothing else will.
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:29.420]   So I'll just end by asking you, moving forward, when you leave this place tonight, which word
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.940]   will better associate for you with following Jesus?
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:37.020]   Will it be failure or victory?
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:41.900]   Good news is Jesus Christ has already won.
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:46.780]   You have everything you need to walk in victory.
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:52.220]   You have God's sight, you have God's strength, and God's spread.
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:44:05.140]   Let's pray together.
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:12.100]   If you're here tonight and you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ, you're realizing
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:16.660]   right now that your soul has been made for Him.
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:21.060]   You have been made for Jesus Christ.
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:28.300]   And Jesus Christ came and died and rose from the dead to bring you into right relationship
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.100]   with God.
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:35.620]   If you want to begin a relationship with Jesus Christ tonight, then I just invite you in
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:41.100]   this moment to pray and say, "Lord Jesus, would you come into my life?
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.900]   Would you forgive me of my sins?
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:49.940]   Thank you that you died on the cross for me.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:52.700]   Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:56.180]   Would you come into my life?
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:00.060]   Would you forgive me of my sins?
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:04.500]   And would you lead me in a new life?"
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:08.380]   And if you're here tonight and you already know Jesus, then let me just encourage you,
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.580]   do business with the Lord now.
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.020]   Don't wait until you leave.
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:19.980]   Like if you've been wearing the wrong lenses, lenses of failure, then take them off and
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:24.460]   invite God's perspective that He's your host, you're His honored guest.
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:28.700]   He takes responsibility for your safety.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:34.020]   Maybe you just get on your knees and you beg God to unleash resurrection power in your
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:37.340]   life through the presence of His Spirit.
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:42.920]   Or maybe you just need to sit and taste and see that God is good, that you just sit here
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:50.380]   tonight until you begin to taste God's goodness, that it would be satisfying to your soul.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:51.500]   Lord Jesus, we need you.
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.500]   We love you.
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:57.480]   We believe that there is no one greater than you.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:05.660]   You are the one we have been made for, God, so I pray that tonight you would do a miraculous
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:07.020]   work in each of our lives.
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.100]   Speak to our hearts.
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:10.100]   We need you.
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:10.820]   In Jesus' name.
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:20.820]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
