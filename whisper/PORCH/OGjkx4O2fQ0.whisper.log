[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.480]   He makes me lie down in green pastures, He leads me beside still waters.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.400]   He restores my soul, He leads me in the path of righteousness for His name's sake.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.080]   Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for you
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.360]   are with me.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.400]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.060]   You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.600]   You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.360]   Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.400]   in the house of the Lord forever."
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.560]   What's up Porch, how are we doing tonight?
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.120]   Hey, it's so good to see you.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.160]   Hope all is well.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.120]   Whether this is your first time or your last time at the Porch, I am so glad that you made
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.120]   it.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.560]   My name is Timothy Atik, I'm one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark on Sundays as well
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.400]   as here at the Porch.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.720]   Hello to everyone watching at a Porch Live location tonight.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.820]   I'm so glad that you are tuning in with us wherever you are at.
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.600]   So here's the deal.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.520]   Some of you know this, not everyone knows this.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.720]   You might have watched a Netflix documentary on this, but in 2017 there was a 26-year-old
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.960]   entrepreneur named Billy McFarlane who came up with an idea.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.400]   So he got together with a rapper friend named Ja Rule, and the two of them decided that
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:49.480]   they were going to try and throw an epic music festival on an island in the Bahamas called
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.240]   Fire Fest.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.680]   So what they did is they went to this island in the Bahamas with some models and they took
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.560]   some pictures of these models on white sandy beaches, and then they asked some influencers
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:15.440]   to promote that they are having a concert on a private island in the Bahamas where Blink-182
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.920]   is going to come and different musical artists are going to come, and it's going to be this
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.220]   all-exclusive, luxurious, epic three-day weekend.
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.860]   So people began to push it on social media, and the thing sold out just like that, which
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:40.920]   is amazing, unless you're the organizers who have not planned any logistics yet for a weekend
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.720]   concert that you just sold out.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.240]   So this 26-year-old Billy McFarlane and this rapper Ja Rule realized that they just sold
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.240]   out a concert that they haven't planned for, and so they began to plan for it, and what
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.240]   they realized is that the island that they had said they were going to hold it on couldn't
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.080]   even hold the amount of people that they had sold tickets to.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.040]   And instead of working the math and making the decision, "This won't work," they instead
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.320]   decided to cross their fingers and hope for the best.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:24.400]   And so these people left the United States and flew to the Bahamas to be a part of a
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.080]   music festival that had no planning that went into it.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.400]   And so when people showed up, the organizers just started pumping people full of alcohol,
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.080]   hoping that they wouldn't realize what was happening.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.560]   And then when night began to fall, people began to wonder, "Where am I staying?"
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.600]   And it is then that everything began to unravel, and people realized that the luxurious cabanas
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.360]   that they thought that they had rented were actually hurricane shelter, little pop-ups
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.560]   that were drenched in water, and people began to run for their lives trying to take shelter.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.200]   The food that they thought they had purchased were actually cheese sandwiches and styrofoam
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.280]   cartons.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.760]   And so you had these people who were trapped on an island with a festival that they had
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.240]   paid thousands of dollars to attend, and the festival never got going because all the musical
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.840]   artists bailed.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.920]   And so did Billy McFarlane.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.720]   And so the reason I tell you that is I want you to think about people's experiences at
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.940]   Fyre Festival.
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.120]   You know what happened?
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.680]   Is their dreams and reality went in two totally different directions.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.160]   Like they dreamed of a three-day epic weekend with friends, seeing musical artists, taking
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.200]   in exotic drinks, meeting new people, and what was reality?
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:07.000]   They found themselves in an airport desperate to get out with no food and no water.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.400]   The places they thought they would be staying were actually miserable hurricane shelters.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.800]   Their dreams and reality went in two totally different directions.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.400]   And I wonder if that describes your life right now.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:33.400]   Like you are living your very own Fyre Festival where your dreams and your reality are going
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.180]   in two totally different directions.
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.580]   Like your dreams of being married and your reality, the person you thought you were going
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.500]   to be married to just broke up with you, that's a tough place to be.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.520]   Your dreams of crushing it in your job and your reality, you just got let go from that
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.760]   job, that's a harsh reality.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.080]   Your dreams of being physically fit and in the best condition of your life at the age
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:12.280]   of 29 and your reality that you have more health issues than some people in their 50s
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.040]   is a harsh reality.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:23.040]   Your dreams of being happy all the time and completely settled in your young adult years
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:31.160]   and your reality that you have been in a funk for months now and you just don't feel yourself
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:37.120]   and you really just don't like being around people and even to come here tonight felt
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.520]   like climbing a mountain, that's a harsh reality.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.560]   And we need to talk about it.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:53.200]   Like how do we navigate the times, the days, the weeks, the months, the seasons of life
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.360]   where our dreams and reality seem to go in two different directions?
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.440]   The good news is that we're not left to ourselves to try and figure that out.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.400]   Like the Scriptures talk a lot about it.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.600]   If you're new to the porch, we teach the Bible here.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.760]   The reason that we put so much emphasis on this book is that we believe that God went
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.400]   to great lengths to speak to us through this book.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.720]   So when we open this book, it's kind of like we're opening up God's mouth.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.360]   God speaks to us when we read this book.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.860]   And if you're new, we are in the middle, this is the third week of a series where we're
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.440]   going through the most famous chapter in the entire Bible.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.440]   It's Psalm 23.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.720]   It's most often read at funerals, but this passage is so much more than a funeral passage.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.360]   It is a passage to life to the full.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.960]   And it's written by a guy named David.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:51.880]   And David knew what it felt like for his dreams and reality to go in different directions.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:58.520]   David was a guy who lived on the run for 15 years because a guy was trying to kill him
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.880]   and take his life.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.080]   David was a guy who lost his best friend.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.560]   His best friend passed away.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.600]   David had kids and his daughter got raped.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.400]   Four of his kids died prematurely.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.360]   He had to bury four of his kids.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.400]   One of his kids rebelled against him and tried to steal the throne from him.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.660]   David had to lead his country through a three-year famine.
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:30.320]   David was a guy who knew what it felt like for his dreams and reality to go in two totally
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.880]   different directions.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.560]   And yet these are the words that he writes.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.040]   He writes these words.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.800]   "The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.580]   I shall not want.
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.140]   He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.780]   He leads me beside still waters.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.900]   He restores my soul.
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.240]   He leads me in paths of righteousness for His name's sake."
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.240]   Now watch this.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.340]   Verse four is where we're landing tonight.
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.640]   We're just going verse by verse through this passage.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.480]   It's taken us five weeks to do it.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.360]   This is week three.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.600]   Verse four.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:12.700]   "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil,
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.520]   for you are with me.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.140]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.860]   Not only are we looking at the most famous passages in the Bible, but we're looking at
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:26.420]   the most famous verse in the most famous passage in the Bible.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.300]   "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil."
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.300]   Why?
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.540]   "For you are with me.
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.000]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.200]   And so here's the deal.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   Let me just ask you, hey, I'm just asking you to be honest.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.640]   You don't have to be honest.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.640]   This is a church, so some people are like, "I definitely can't be honest at church."
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.160]   Some of you guys have no problem being honest.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.560]   If you're in one of those seasons of life where your dreams and reality have gone in
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.760]   two different directions, would you just slip up your hand real quick so I know who I'm
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.760]   talking to?
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.760]   Okay.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.040]   There's a lot of people in this room.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.040]   Hey, I would say that's me too.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.120]   I would say that that's right where I'm at even this week.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.280]   My dreams and reality have gone in two different directions.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.320]   Here's what we want.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.140]   We want our circumstances to change, right?
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.360]   That's what we want most.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.220]   We want our circumstances to change.
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:29.220]   But as we look at Psalm 23 verse 4, what I would argue is that more than our circumstances
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:35.320]   changing, there are three other things that might need to change if you want to navigate
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.300]   the path of the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.740]   The first thing that might need to change is this.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:46.820]   You might need to change what you believe, okay?
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.120]   The first thing that I want to encourage you, if you feel like right now your dreams and
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.520]   reality are going in different directions, if you feel like you are in some ways walking
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.620]   through the valley of the shadow of death, then I want to encourage you, you might need
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.260]   to change what you believe.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260]   Now that sounds like a big statement.
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:11.500]   You just walked into a church and the guy on stage is telling you, you might need to
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.260]   change what you believe.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.900]   Why do I say that?
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.820]   Well, I told you that King David is writing this passage.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.780]   Who was David to God?
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:31.740]   God looked at David and gave David a title.
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.620]   Here's the title God gave to David.
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:39.620]   God referred to David as the man after my own heart.
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:45.340]   It's a pretty big compliment when the God of the universe looks at David and says, "You
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.940]   know who you are?
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.260]   You know who you will be?
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.820]   You will be the man after my own heart."
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:55.660]   But God had a deep affection for David.
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:01.100]   He made David king of his people, the nation of Israel.
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:10.580]   And yet David, the man after God's own heart, God's king, the guy that God had made king,
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.660]   he's the one saying that he is walking through the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.860]   Do you know what that tells us?
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:21.980]   It tells us that bad things happen even to God's people.
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:28.340]   So that's why I say you might need to change what you believe because your belief structure
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:35.060]   really might not be able to handle the truth at this point that bad things happen even
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.940]   to God's people.
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:42.140]   To just dig down the rabbit hole a little bit more, if you were to look back at what
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.860]   David said last week, at the end of verse 3, what does he say?
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:51.240]   He says that his shepherd leads me in paths of righteousness.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.460]   What did we say that means?
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:57.540]   It means that David is saying God leads me in right paths.
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:06.060]   And so what David is saying is the right paths in life are the paths that lead to green pastures
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:12.540]   and still waters, and the right paths also lead straight through the valley of the shadow
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.980]   of death.
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:26.060]   Do your beliefs allow for that type of experience where God can be good for leading you to green
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:32.300]   pastures and quiet waters, and God can still be good when He leads you through the valley
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.220]   of the shadow of death?
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:40.540]   Does your beliefs really allow for that?
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.580]   Because this is what the Scriptures teach.
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:47.760]   I mean, I think about what Jesus says in John 16, 33.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.180]   What does He say?
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.340]   He says, "I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace."
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.340]   Watch what He says.
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.060]   Watch His wording.
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.180]   He says, "In this world you will have trouble."
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.920]   Like, I don't know how Jesus could have been more clear.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:10.660]   He gathers His friends on the night that He is about to leave them.
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.860]   He's like, "All right, guys, bring it in.
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:17.140]   Take a knee.
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:22.360]   In this world you will have trouble."
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.860]   So Jesus, let me make sure I'm hearing you.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:28.380]   If I believe in you, everything's going to go exactly how I want it to go.
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.700]   I'm going to get the guy.
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.980]   I'm going to get the job.
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.500]   I'm going to make the money.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:42.120]   "In this world," hello McFly, is anybody home?
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:51.160]   "In this world you will," not you might, not it's a possibility, not if you draw the short
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.080]   straw, but you will have trouble.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:00.160]   Jesus couldn't have said it more clearly, and yet we lose our ever-loving minds and
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.240]   we feel like God has abandoned us.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:09.560]   He's deserted us when things don't go how we want them to go.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.700]   I've experienced that.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.640]   I've watched other people experience that.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.640]   You know what we want?
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.680]   We want karma.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.240]   We want the idea that if you do good, you get good.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.720]   That's the belief system that many of us live with.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:28.880]   I remember watching a friend in his mid-20s begin dating this girl.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.680]   Did everything right.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.680]   Did everything right.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.520]   They were dating for months.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.640]   He's a godly man.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.200]   She's a godly woman.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.500]   He was trying to lead her in a healthy way.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.680]   They were physically pure in their relationship.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.400]   He was very respectful.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.120]   He was very thoughtful.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.400]   Took her on great dates.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.440]   Was trying to do everything that God would want him to do.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:55.120]   And out of the blue, she broke up with him and ended up not too long from them getting
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.180]   together with another guy and they got married.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:06.380]   And I remember this guy just thinking, "I did everything right."
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:15.060]   I remember when my close friend, I was in my mid-20s, he passed away serving our country.
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:22.780]   And I remember getting the news that he had, the tank he was in ran over an IED and it
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.560]   killed him.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.060]   And I remember getting that news and driving down the toll road with tears in my eyes just
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:34.380]   wondering, "God, why would you let this happen?"
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:39.980]   Even recently, within the last few months, there's been various challenges that our family
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:45.800]   has navigated and there's part of me that's just been like, "God, what are you doing?"
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.800]   You know what we want?
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.660]   We want God to be like a cosmic-sized vending machine.
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:54.340]   You know where you walk up and you look and it's like E6.
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.700]   So you just have to push two buttons, E6.
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:03.060]   So we're like, "As long as I push E, meaning I read my Bible and I pray and I come to the
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:08.340]   porch and as long as I push six, which means I don't do too many stupid things and I try
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:15.780]   to live a good life, then what we expect is for God to drop down exactly what we want."
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.100]   And yet we live in these moments where the vending machine of heaven gets jammed and
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:25.540]   we're like, "What's going on?"
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:34.300]   See Jesus told us, "In this world you will have trouble."
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.300]   My time's not over yet.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.980]   I mean, I know I've been talking a while, but what if y'all did that?
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:40.980]   What if you all set timers?
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:46.340]   You're like, "They'll all go off when we think you've been talking too long."
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:50.980]   That would be an amazing way to do church.
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.100]   Anyway, I want to encourage you to answer this question.
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.020]   I'm going to put it on the screen.
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.860]   Here's the question.
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:06.900]   Can God lead you through a moment or season of deep darkness and still be fully good,
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:11.820]   trustworthy, faithful, and worthy of your life and worship?
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:17.980]   David says, "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death."
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:23.020]   Another way of saying that is, "Even though I walk through deep darkness."
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:30.020]   Like David is writing about a time in his life of deep darkness.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:36.860]   Like it's possible that his life was even on the line when he was writing this, and
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.120]   yet he still saw his shepherd as good.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:45.580]   This is the question that I have my kids pondering right now.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.780]   This is a big one for our family.
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:52.180]   Like we sat at night, what we do when we sit around the dinner table, we don't do this
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:57.220]   every night, but when we do have a family dinner, we've got these little flashcards
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.980]   of the alphabet.
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.340]   And for each letter of the alphabet, there's one attribute of God.
[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:08.380]   And so recently we talked about, for P, we talked about God being perfect.
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:15.360]   And I asked my kids who really handled our move to Dallas hard, like the move was very
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:21.860]   difficult for them, like very challenging for them, heartbreaking for them.
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.460]   And so I asked them, I said, "Hey, do you all believe God's perfect?"
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.460]   They're like, "Yes."
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.580]   Even moving us to Dallas.
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:39.620]   Well, I've got to think about it, because perfect, just because God's perfect doesn't
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:52.980]   mean your experience on earth will be perfectly what you want it to be.
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:58.780]   As I've been preparing this series, I read through a book called A Shepherd's Look at
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.660]   Psalm 23 by a guy named Philip Keller.
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.700]   And here's what he said.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:08.500]   He said, "It's common practice for shepherds to take their flocks to higher country during
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.740]   the summer.
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:15.060]   But in order for the shepherd to ascend the mountains with his sheep, he must lead his
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.300]   sheep through valleys.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:22.180]   And the valleys can be places where there are predators, avalanches, poisonous plants,
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.100]   storms, and floods along the valley floors.
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.820]   In addition, since the sun does not shine into the valley very well, there really are
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:35.220]   shadows which at any moment may become shadows of death."
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.100]   So what does this mean for the Christian life?
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.100]   Here's what it means.
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:46.220]   It means the path to spiritual mountaintops will inevitably take you through dark valleys.
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:51.660]   Like when you look around and you see really spiritual people, if something in you is like,
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.500]   "Man, I just want to be a godly person.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.020]   Like I want to be someone on fire for the Lord."
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.060]   Well, just take to heart what A.W.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:03.460]   Tozer, a famous author and pastor from the 1900s said.
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:14.020]   He said, "It is doubtful whether God can bless a man greatly until he has hurt him deeply."
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.940]   You know what this means?
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:23.740]   It means God isn't just leading you through the valley, He is leading you to new heights.
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.820]   He is taking you to new places of intimacy with Him.
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:34.980]   He wants you to flourish, but a part of you flourishing might be taking you through places
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.820]   of deep darkness.
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:42.300]   Charles Spurgeon, famous pastor from the 1800s said this.
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:48.900]   He said, "I have learned to kiss the waves that throw me against the rock of ages."
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.100]   Do you hear what he's saying?
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:56.660]   I've learned to kiss the waves that throw me against the rock of ages.
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:02.580]   Because sometimes when your dreams and reality go in separate directions, it can feel devastating,
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:08.140]   it can feel disappointing, and yet that is where God meets you.
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.740]   And He doesn't waste your pain.
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.700]   In God's economy, no pain is pointless.
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:21.940]   God can take your pain and He can use it in a very specific way to draw you closer to
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:27.960]   Him for you to see God in ways that you've never seen Him before.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.980]   And so let me just encourage you with this.
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:37.460]   It's interesting because a lot of times when life is good, someone else gets the credit,
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:38.460]   right?
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:43.520]   Like when we get into a relationship and our life feels amazing, like we give the credit
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.580]   to the relationship.
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.860]   Or when things are going well at work, we give the credit to our hard work or something
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:50.860]   else.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:56.100]   Like when life is good, someone else gets the credit, but when life is bad, God gets
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.540]   the credit.
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:03.700]   Like we blame God, but when life is good, we celebrate someone or something else or
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.700]   ourselves.
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.600]   Here's the reality.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.900]   Change what you believe.
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.820]   In this world, you will have trouble.
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:16.180]   And because of that, here's what I want to encourage you to do.
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.500]   Be grateful in the good times and be faithful in the tough times.
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.500]   That's it.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.040]   That's the key.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.500]   Be grateful in the good times.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.740]   So when life is good, for those of you who didn't raise your hands, your dreams and reality
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.460]   are not in two separate directions.
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.100]   They're actually synced up.
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.760]   Be grateful.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:38.140]   Get on your knees and praise God for that.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.200]   And if your dreams and reality are going in different directions, be faithful.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.940]   Be faithful.
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.660]   Just because you can't see God doing something doesn't mean he's not doing something.
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.540]   But you might need to change what you believe.
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.660]   We don't believe in karma.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:58.740]   We believe in a good shepherd who will lead you to green pastures and quiet waters, and
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:03.500]   he will also lead you to the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:08.900]   Number two, you might need to change what you fear.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:13.000]   You might need to change what you fear.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   What does David say?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.900]   He says, "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death," what's the next words?
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:24.140]   "I will fear no evil."
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:32.420]   So he's looking at his deep season of deep darkness and he says, "I will fear no evil."
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.260]   Why?
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.100]   Why?
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:42.700]   "Because his good shepherd is present and his good shepherd is prepared."
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.060]   His good shepherd is present.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.060]   What does David say?
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.340]   "I will fear no evil."
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.340]   Why?
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.660]   "For you are with me."
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:56.100]   See when you realize that your good shepherd is with you, every single inch of the valley
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.260]   of the shadow of death, it changes things.
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:05.460]   When you are confident in the character of God and you know that he is with you, it changes
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.460]   things.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.920]   But he's not just present, he's prepared.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:16.020]   That's why David says, "Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:21.820]   The rod of the shepherd speaks to the power and the authority of the shepherd.
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:26.420]   See the rod of the shepherd was used to protect the sheep.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:32.560]   It was to fight off predators and the rod was also used to discipline the sheep.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:37.100]   So that's a reference to the power and authority of the shepherd.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.900]   But he says, "Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:45.900]   The staff is what we think of when we think of images of shepherds.
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.340]   It's what has the crook in it.
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:53.620]   See the staff of the shepherd represented the care and compassion of the shepherd.
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:26:00.140]   The shepherd would use the staff to pull a sheep in close to him to examine him to make
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.660]   sure that he or she was okay.
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:10.320]   The staff is what was used to pick up a baby lamb to bring it to its mom.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.420]   The staff sometimes, Philip Keller writes, that sometimes the staff was used just to
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:18.580]   touch the side of a sheep to give direction.
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:23.600]   And at other times, if a shepherd had a favorite sheep, sometimes the shepherd would take the
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:30.100]   staff and just touch the side of the sheep as a sign of affection to say, "I'm here and
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.420]   I care for you."
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.580]   And so David is able to say, "I will fear no evil."
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.580]   Why?
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:43.800]   Because he's confident that his shepherd is present and his shepherd is prepared.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.860]   And so do you believe that God is with you?
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:53.380]   Like, do you firmly believe that God is with you?
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.500]   Every minute of every day.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:59.820]   I know just something that helps put this in perspective for me.
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:05.100]   Several years ago when my oldest son Noah, when he was about four years old, he woke
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:09.820]   up one afternoon from his afternoon nap and he was just screaming his head off.
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.980]   And we were like, "All right, well, sometimes this is normal."
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.540]   And so we just kind of let him be.
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.820]   But it didn't stop.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:21.260]   Like, it went on for an hour, went on for two hours.
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.900]   So this kid, he's just losing his mind for two hours.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.700]   Then we move into the night.
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.260]   We move into the evening and he is still crying.
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.340]   And so we begin to think through different scenarios.
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.140]   Like, what's causing this?
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.660]   The options are, number one, he had a bad dream.
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.540]   Number two, he doesn't feel well.
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.540]   Number three, he's possessed.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.540]   Like, we don't know.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.340]   Like, we're trying.
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:54.020]   We're all viable, trying to figure it out.
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.460]   Didn't seem like it was the first one.
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:56.740]   Didn't seem like it was the second one.
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:02.780]   We were going to go ahead and just hope for the best that it wasn't the third one.
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.980]   So I remember we put him in his bed to go to sleep and he's just still losing his mind.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:11.380]   And so what I do as his dad is I just go and I get my pillow and I get a blanket.
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:12.380]   I walk into his room.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.540]   I pull out his trundle bed and I say, "Hey, dude, I'm going to sleep in here with you."
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:24.300]   I lay down and the minute I did, he stopped crying and he fell right to sleep.
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:31.820]   And I tell you that just to say the presence of his father changed something.
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:40.020]   And when you begin to believe that your God, that the God of the universe, the God where
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:47.900]   Jesus Christ, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are God, that He's
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:58.060]   with you, that He loves you, and He is with you every single inch of the valley, it can
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.780]   change things.
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:04.560]   Like when you wake up tomorrow morning, He's in your room with you.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.620]   When you are driving your car, He's there.
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.220]   When you're at work, He's there.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:13.980]   He's with you every moment of the day and He's prepared.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:19.540]   He's prepared with power and authority, but also care and compassion.
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:24.000]   He's prepared for every aspect of your life.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.860]   Do you believe that?
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.300]   David was able to say, "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.820]   I will fear no evil."
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:36.100]   He didn't have to fear the valley.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.280]   Why?
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.640]   Because he feared his good shepherd.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.780]   That's why I say you might need to change what you fear.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:52.340]   What I'm inviting you to do is to displace your fear from your circumstances to your
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.180]   good shepherd.
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:30:01.140]   See a lot of times we position faith as the opposite of fear.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:05.420]   But faith isn't actually the opposite of fear.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:09.180]   Faith is the redemption of fear.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.180]   You're like, "What are you talking about?"
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.060]   Well, let me show you.
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:17.180]   If you were to look at Mark chapter 4, verses 39 through 41, it's a famous passage that
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:21.660]   we use when we talk about anxiety or the storms of life.
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:25.980]   It's a story about Jesus calming the storm.
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:31.900]   And when Jesus calms the storm, listen to what He says.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:36.580]   It says in verse 39 that, "He," Jesus, "awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea,
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.740]   'Peace be still.'
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.420]   And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.940]   And Jesus said to them, 'Why are you so afraid?
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.380]   Have you still no faith?'"
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.040]   We're like, "Oh, well, that's the opposite.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.220]   Faith is the opposite of fear."
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.360]   But look at what happened with the disciples.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:55.420]   It says, "And they were filled with," what?
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:31:01.840]   "Great fear and said to one another, 'Who then is this that even the wind and the sea
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.840]   obey Him?'"
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.840]   Do you see?
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:12.620]   Their fear was transferred from the sea to the one who was greater than the sea.
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.660]   That's the redemption of fear.
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.580]   That's faith.
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:22.100]   And so when I tell you, "You might need to change what you fear," what I'm inviting you
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:27.820]   to do is to trade up from the fear of your circumstances to the fear of the one who is
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:31.180]   greater than your circumstances.
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.780]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:38.380]   So what does it mean to fear God?
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.620]   What does it mean to fear God?
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:47.000]   Well, fear is what happens when humility and awe get together and have a baby.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.240]   When humility and awe get together, they give birth to fear.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:59.020]   Fear is what happens when you see God for who He is and you realize who He is and who
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.940]   you're not.
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.500]   That He's God and you're not.
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.240]   That He's big and you're small.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.100]   That He's strong and you're weak.
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.540]   That He's in control and you're not.
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.780]   That's humility.
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:14.380]   And then you think about awe.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:19.920]   You stand before Him and you realize He's not just a great God who spoke the universe
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.660]   into being.
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.800]   That He is in control of all things.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.800]   He's not just great.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.060]   He's also good.
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.660]   That He actually cares.
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:40.220]   And when you come to God with a posture of humility and awe, the result is fear, which
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:45.260]   is simply redeemed faith.
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:55.140]   And the product is not anxiety, but awe, because you look at God instead of your circumstances.
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:33:02.340]   The real picture of this is when Jesus walks on water and invites Peter to do the same.
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:05.380]   Peter begins to walk on water and then he begins to sink.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:06.580]   Why did he begin to sink?
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:12.500]   Because he began to look at the waters instead of looking at the one who controlled the waters.
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:17.900]   And so I just tell you that to say you might need to change what you fear.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:23.620]   I know for me just personally, like I have a personality that leans toward anxiety.
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:27.820]   I have taken medication for anxiety at different points in my life.
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:34.000]   That's the way my personality leans is toward anxiety.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.380]   And just in the last week, there are things that could cause me fear.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:43.340]   Like I went to the doctor and the doctor looked at my vocal cords.
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.300]   It was like you got a small bump on your vocal cords.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.020]   It was like that's never what you want to hear.
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.460]   So tomorrow I go on seven days of vocal rest.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:51.820]   My wife is so thrilled.
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:57.460]   She's not going to hear from me for seven days.
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:01.220]   But there's room for all sorts of fear.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.900]   Like what's going to happen?
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:03.900]   What does this mean?
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:04.900]   Am I going to be able to speak?
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.040]   That's what I do for a living.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:12.820]   And then different things have gone on with our kids in different ways that it's like
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:18.060]   how are they going to turn out?
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:21.780]   They're not going to turn out right.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:24.740]   They're not going to turn out right.
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:33.660]   And it's like I can either fear my circumstances or I can look to the one who is in control
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.220]   of.
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:38.940]   He's just greater than my circumstances.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.980]   And he's good.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.200]   And he's great.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.220]   And he's with me.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:48.280]   And he'll never leave me or forsake me.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:52.560]   And even if things don't go how I want them to go, in the end it's going to be better
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:57.380]   because it's going to be what he wants, not what I want.
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:03.000]   And so I just want to encourage you to change what you fear.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:10.160]   And then finally, you might not just need to change what you believe or change what
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.240]   you fear.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:16.080]   I want to invite you to change what you expect.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.120]   What do I mean by that?
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:22.640]   When I talk about what you expect, let's just talk about what our expectations are.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:30.080]   Our expectations or what our anticipation is, is of a day when things are going to be
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.520]   normal again.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.960]   Like that's what we expect.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.240]   That's what we're hoping for.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.280]   That's what we're waiting for.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:43.720]   We're just waiting for the dreams and reality that are going like this to kind of get redirected
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:48.680]   by Google Maps and they're going to find their way back together to where our dreams and
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:53.240]   reality are going in the same direction.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.880]   And that just might be the wrong expectation.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.200]   You might need to change what you expect.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:08.840]   There's two things that I love from this one verse that I want to highlight for you.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.280]   The first is this.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:18.280]   I always find it interesting that David says he walks through the valley of the shadow
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.280]   of death.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.160]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:25.480]   Like how would your version read?
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:34.840]   The TAV, the Timothy Attik version would read, "Even though I sprinted through the valley
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.520]   of the shadow of death."
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:43.400]   It would not read, "Walk, because I can run.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.880]   I ran in high school on track.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.840]   I got the letter jacket to prove it.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:54.600]   About 30 pounds heavier, but still I can run, people."
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.080]   What would yours read?
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.400]   "Even though I scrape and clawed my way through the valley of the shadow."
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.160]   It's like David's not in a hurry.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.800]   He's not in a hurry to get through it.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:12.600]   Even though I walk, I just walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.440]   He's not frantic.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:18.960]   He's not trying to escape it to get back to comfortable green pastures.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:28.200]   As fast as possible, he's on his feet and he's moving one step at a time.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.660]   I find that interesting.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:38.240]   The second thing that I really love about this is the shift in the passage from he to
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.100]   you.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:44.080]   So I don't know if you noticed it, but in the first three verses, look back at the first
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.080]   three verses.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.720]   "The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.720]   I shall not want."
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.720]   Watch this.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.560]   "He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.720]   He leads me beside still waters.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.440]   He restores my soul.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.560]   He leads me in paths of righteousness for His name's sake.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.560]   Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil."
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.560]   Why?
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:07.440]   "For you are with me."
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:15.320]   The language goes from distant, "He's doing this," to intimate, "You."
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:23.680]   Isn't it interesting that the greatest intimacy often comes through the greatest trials in
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.960]   life?
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:32.240]   Sometimes the greatest intimacy with God comes through the greatest trials.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.040]   Why would I say that?
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:43.400]   I say that because when life is good, we forget about God.
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.120]   When life is hard, we have to make a decision.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:52.040]   We're either going to reject God or we're going to cling to Him.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:57.960]   And so I'll just say, man, I've shared with you guys before, 2022 was the hardest year
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.440]   of my life.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.920]   Hardest year of my life.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:12.920]   And I can say with confidence that I know God better today than I did 12 months ago.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:20.320]   And I am more confident that God is good than I was 12 months ago.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.360]   And it hasn't been an easy week.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.240]   It hasn't been an easy week at all.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:31.920]   The next week, I already know it's going to be a very difficult week, but I am more confident
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:41.240]   than ever that God is good, even in the midst of the trials, because there's an intimacy
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.800]   that I've gotten to experience with Him.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:50.560]   Because for an extended part of 2022, I looked to my circumstances for my joy.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:57.640]   And when I did, I lost my joy because there was no joy to be found in my circumstances.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:02.040]   I was probably on the verge of depression.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:11.880]   And then Psalm 34, I read it and it said this, "Those who look to Him are radiant."
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:19.160]   David says, "I sought the Lord and He answered me and delivered me from all my fears.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:22.640]   Those who look to Him are radiant."
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.360]   And I realized I'm not radiant.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.080]   I'm borderline depressed.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:34.200]   And I began to turn my eyes back to the Lord and He restored my joy.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:40.600]   And so even now when not everything is exactly how I want it to be, my dreams and reality,
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.320]   at least this week, are going in different directions.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:46.160]   And yet I can tell you, I have my joy.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.720]   My joy is intact.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.840]   Why?
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.080]   Because He's still good.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.940]   He's the good shepherd.
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.760]   He is present and He is prepared.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:00.280]   His rod and His staff, they comfort me.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:04.560]   And they can comfort you as well.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.560]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:09.920]   If you think back to how I started, I started talking about fire festival.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:13.880]   So if you were to take that analogy and you were to apply it to your life, doesn't that
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:19.920]   make God the organizer?
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.800]   Like you see the flaw with the analogy, right?
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:30.600]   Because now I've put God in the position of this 26-year-old entrepreneur who made a mess
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.600]   of things.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.480]   Here's the difference.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.400]   Billy McFarland did no planning.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:44.600]   Jesus said, "In this world you will have trouble, but take heart."
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.200]   Why?
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:51.480]   I have overcome the world.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.400]   How did He overcome the world?
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:02.360]   Well, Jesus walked through the Kidron Valley to the Garden of Gethsemane where He would
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.120]   pray as the good shepherd.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:08.920]   It was in the Garden of Gethsemane where as the good shepherd, He would tell the Father,
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.040]   "Not my will, but Your will be done."
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.160]   He would lay down His life as a good shepherd.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:21.120]   And then He would be arrested in that garden and led back through the Kidron Valley, led
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.800]   like a sheep to the slaughter.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:31.280]   See He walked through the valley of the shadow of death, once as a good shepherd and the
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:37.040]   other as the Lamb of God who would take away the sins of the world because He would go
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:42.520]   to the cross and it was on that cross and it was through His empty tomb that we just
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:48.840]   celebrated on Sunday that He would conquer Satan, sin, and death.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:57.640]   And so we can look to Jesus with confidence and expectation because He has already overcome
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:58.640]   the world.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:04.240]   So we don't have to have our best life now because our short stay here on earth is but
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:10.760]   a few mere years, but a day is coming where He will come and He will take us to where
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.760]   He is.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:16.600]   In Revelation 21 it's clear that for those who know Jesus, a day is coming where there
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:22.480]   will be no more pain, no more tears, no more death because the old has passed away and
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.480]   the new has come.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:27.080]   Jesus Christ is the one who has overcome the grave.
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:33.480]   He has conquered sin and death and He will make all things new.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:40.200]   And He, according to the Scriptures, is the good shepherd who laid down His life for His
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.200]   sheep.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.840]   So I just ask you, do you know Him?
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.840]   Do you know Him?
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:50.040]   If you don't know Him, what's keeping you from knowing Jesus Christ?
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:55.440]   Like if you're here tonight and you're not a Christian, what's keeping you from Christianity?
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.960]   What's keeping you from Jesus?
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.800]   Figure that out tonight.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.240]   Wrestle with that truth tonight.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:12.640]   And if you know Jesus and yet you're not clinging to Him, let me just say He's trustworthy.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.960]   He's with you.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.340]   He's for you.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:16.600]   He's present.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.960]   He's prepared.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.680]   Would you trust Him tonight?
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:25.680]   Let's pray together.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:41.240]   If you're here tonight and you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ and yet you
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:48.120]   realize what Jesus has done for you, that He died on a cross for you, He rose from the
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:53.720]   dead conquering all of your sin.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:45:01.080]   And He did that to bring you into a right relationship with God.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:07.480]   If you want to know Jesus Christ tonight, if you want to be made right with God, if
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:12.640]   that's you, I just invite you in this moment, just in the quietness of your own heart, there's
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.280]   no magical words.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.640]   It's just you saying what you believe to be true.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.040]   It can go something like this.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:27.400]   You can just repeat after me, just say, "Lord Jesus, would you come into my life tonight?
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:31.460]   Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me.
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:37.840]   Thank you, Jesus, that you rose from the dead for me.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.160]   Would you come into my life?
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:44.640]   Would you forgive me of my sins?
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:55.000]   And would you begin to lead me in a new life with you as my Savior and as my King?"
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:06.240]   Just say these words, say, "Jesus, I give my life to you tonight."
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:14.520]   And if you're here and your dreams and reality are going in two different directions, I just
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:19.680]   want to invite you in this moment to just tell God, just say, "I trust you."
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:21.000]   Just say that.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.360]   Just say those words, "I trust you.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:33.720]   I trust you."
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:36.720]   And this is just a moment for you to do business with the Lord.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:44.920]   If there's any ways where your beliefs need to be changed, maybe you've been living for
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:56.880]   karma more than Christ, maybe you just confess that to Him and you invite His healing in.
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.120]   Just do business with the Lord.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.320]   Lord Jesus, we need you.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.320]   We love you.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.720]   We just pray that you, by the power of your Spirit, would have your way in our hearts
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.720]   tonight.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:10.360]   We thank you that you are the Good Shepherd who laid down His life for the sheep.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:15.280]   God, I thank you that even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:20.560]   we don't have to fear evil, for you are with us.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.360]   And you're right in your step to comfort us.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.360]   We need you.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.800]   In Jesus' name.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:34.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
