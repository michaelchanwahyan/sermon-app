00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
 Good evening and welcome to the porch. I'm here to guide you on your journey through the complex

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:14,120
 world of relationships. Can we cue some music please? From our friendships to our romantic

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,600
 endeavors, we'll explore our family bonds, estranged relationships, work dynamics, and

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,760
 perhaps even the relationship with oneself. So how do we relate? To answer this, we'll look to

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,560
 scripture and find exactly what God has to say about our relationships. This is, after all,

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:39,600
 the Relationship Series. Porch, how we doing? We doing okay tonight? It's great to see you. It's

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,760
 great to be back. We are in the Relationship Series. If this is your first time being a part

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,960
 of the series and you're not too late, we've got a little bit more for you. Dallas, you look good.

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,920
 Grateful you're in the room. But everybody that's tuning in online, like we love that God is doing

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,760
 something special here in our city, but he's doing something special all over the globe.

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,400
 Literally, the stories we get, they're crazy. And so we're grateful that y'all would trust us

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,480
 with your evening and you would be a part of what God is doing here. Special shout out to

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:13,880
 Porch Live, Dayton, Wheaton, and Des Moines. All right, to start things off, I want to play a

14
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,680
 little game with all of you. Does that sound okay? So everybody stand up and look around at the

15
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,080
 people standing to your left and your right. We're going to be doing a lot of this here in this

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:33,600
 game. So it's good just to prove to one another that you are actually capable of standing up.

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,720
 Now everybody sit down for me. You just proved you could do it and now I'm going to put you to

18
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:54,520
 the test. I want you to stand up. Oh man. This is going to be exposing for some of you. I want

19
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:04,520
 you to stand up if you think Crocs are actually an acceptable form of fashion. That's bold.

20
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:13,120
 You're bold. All right, sit down for me. Sit down. You can judge and appeal to your friends

21
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:21,120
 later on. I want you to stand up if you actually believe cats are better companions than dogs.

22
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:31,240
 Loud and proud down here in the front. Our feline friends, Mr. Ben Craychee as well. All

23
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,160
 right. It's getting a little hotter in here. We'll keep turning up the heat. I want you to

24
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,160
 stand up if you own an Android instead of an iPhone. The few and the proud. There they are. You

25
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:54,740
 know, I'll give it to my Android users. We always know our Android users because they simply

26
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,620
 make themselves known. They think they have something to brag about but we all know that's

27
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,620
 not the case. I want you to stand up if you use Apple Music instead of Spotify. Oh my gosh.

28
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:15,700
 Micaela, no! Oh no. Okay, okay, okay, okay. For my Apple Music users, I have to ask, I have to

29
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:29,700
 ask, why? It is inferior to Spotify. It absolutely is. All right, stand up if you prefer working

30
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:37,940
 from the office than working at home. I'm already standing up but I'm like, I'm trying to get up

31
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:45,940
 as much as I can because I love being in the office. I love being around people. All right.

32
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:52,740
 Grab a seat. Last one. Last one. And this one is really big. So hey, I need you all to lean in

33
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,520
 and really engage with this one because we're going to turn a corner into something really

34
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,980
 significant here. I need you to stand up if you're actually single and ready to mingle. No,

35
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:07,980
 no, no, I'm just kidding. Don't do that. Don't do that. That is one opportunity here at the

36
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:17,360
 porch but we are about other more significant things than that. Okay. Here's why we did that.

37
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:23,820
 We just learned a lot about one another, right? You just learned where your peers stand on some

38
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:30,460
 pretty important subjects. You were able to size them up and you were able to stack yourself in

39
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,900
 comparison to them. And while this was super lighthearted and it was a really good time,

40
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:44,380
 here's the thing. Oftentimes, comparison is anything but lighthearted and fun.

41
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:51,580
 It's interesting. If you go and you read the research, studies show that roughly 10% of

42
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:57,100
 normal human thought is comparative in nature, which if you look at the average human life,

43
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:04,220
 which would be roughly 77 years, 10% of 77 years equates to five years of total life.

44
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:11,340
 That means five years of your life you are spending comparing yourself to other people.

45
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:19,020
 I don't know how that sits with you. That's alarming to me. Like the thought that I'm giving

46
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:27,020
 up five years of myself to comparing me to some of you jokers? No, thank you. You know what,

47
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:34,380
 I'm just kidding. This is the way that we work though. Like hardwired under the heart of humanity

48
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,460
 is this need to stack up against other people to measure ourselves against one another. And the

49
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,660
 world knows it. Like the world knows that this is a meaningful way in which we relate to one

50
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,940
 another. Like we live in a society that not only accepts comparison as a way in which we interact,

51
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,860
 but actually has commodified, commercialized comparison through celebrity culture that's

52
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,100
 telling you how you're supposed to live your life or self-help books that are trying to

53
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:07,420
 advocate your personal development or a specially manicured social media feed. That way you can

54
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:12,940
 see who it is that you should be stacking yourself alongside. Our world knows that this is something

55
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,100
 that is meaningful for us. And truthfully, we don't need to look at the culture to realize that

56
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:23,500
 comparison is a problem. We just need to look at ourselves. Like some of you can relate to the fact

57
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,140
 that that guy at the office, like he got the promotion even though he wasn't even trying for

58
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,540
 it. Like you were the one that were staying late and burning the midnight oil and making sure the

59
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,100
 candle wick was lit at both ends and giving as much as possible because you really wanted to

60
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:43,740
 get into that position to achieve that promotion. Others of you have a friend who was totally

61
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,540
 content in their season of singleness. You know, like man, I'm fully and undividedly devoted to

62
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,460
 this season of my life and chasing after the Lord. And yet for whatever reason, God just set this

63
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,860
 dude in my life. And now we're dating despite the fact that you have been doing all the same

64
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,660
 things and you want so badly to be in a relationship as well. Others of you, you know that group went

65
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,980
 and they had an amazing weekend together because you weren't with them. You were sitting at home

66
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:13,420
 and you saw it on Instagram. Others of you have tried so hard to get recognition for your good

67
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,140
 works, whether it's at the office or it's amongst your family or it's amongst your peers. And yet

68
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,340
 no one recognizes you despite you work so hard. They recognize other people.

69
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:29,420
 Like, can we just level with ourselves for a second and acknowledge the fact

70
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:38,620
 that comparison is a problem? Like what it does is it causes us to look at the success of someone

71
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:44,060
 else and measure ourselves against it. And in the process of measuring ourselves against it,

72
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:53,740
 what we often find is we're embroiled with our failure. We see a deep sense of inadequacy.

73
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:00,380
 So we find that we're angry or we're anxious or we're self-loathing or we have a lowered

74
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:07,020
 self-esteem. We become jealous. We're bitter. We're insecure. We have a sense of hate for someone else.

75
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,740
 Comparison is a dangerous thing. There's no question about it. And there's no question

76
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,500
 that we're all engaging with it. It's a part of the regular human experience.

77
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:28,060
 So what do we do with it? Like if we're going to come in contact with it, and not even just tomorrow,

78
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:36,780
 but before the night's over, what do we do with it? How do we navigate the waters of comparison

79
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:42,300
 in a way that is riddled with wisdom and is informed by the word? That's what I want to

80
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,820
 do with us tonight. That's what I want to walk us through over the course of our evening together.

81
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:52,060
 I want to show you how you can overcome comparison in your life. And the place that we're going to do

82
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,620
 it is we're going to do it in the gospel of John. So if you have a Bible, you can grab it.

83
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:04,300
 John chapter 21 is where we're going to be. That's the very last chapter in the gospel of John. We've

84
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,140
 been working through the relationship series here at The Porch. And what we've been doing over the

85
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,420
 course of this series is that we've been looking at different relational categories. We've been

86
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,700
 looking at dating and marriage and friendship and working relationships and estranged relationships.

87
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,940
 We've been looking at all manner of different relationships we find in our life. And yet this

88
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,340
 evening we decided that we didn't just want to look at a relational category. We wanted to look

89
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:32,140
 at a way in which we often relate to each other. And in comparison, it really is universal. Like

90
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,660
 it makes its way into every single category that we have talked about throughout this series.

91
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:44,060
 And the reason we're in John chapter 21 is we see a story of comparison where Jesus interacts with

92
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:50,540
 a guy that really should know better. You see, what we find in chapter 21 of John's gospel is

93
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:56,860
 that Jesus has died for the sins of the world and he's risen from the grave. And he's in that

94
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,620
 intermittent period before he ascends to the right hand of the father, where he's sort of

95
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,660
 working a 40-day masterclass with the disciples. He's showing them, "Hey boys, this is how we're

96
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,100
 going to save the world. Here's your mission. Get up there and do it." He's working them through

97
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,420
 this 40-day class. And what he's doing is he's engaging specifically in our story tonight with

98
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:19,340
 a guy by the name of Peter. By the time we come to the story we see with Peter, Peter has already

99
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,940
 been restored into right relationship with Jesus. If you don't know Peter's story, he was one of

100
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:31,020
 Jesus's inner three, one of his best friends, one of his guys. And yet when the going got tough,

101
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:36,780
 Peter got going. He denied Jesus three times at the point of his arrest. He said he had nothing

102
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:42,220
 to do with the man and then he rebelled. And he was ostracized from the disciples. And yet Jesus

103
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,300
 comes to him in chapter 21 and he restores him to relationship. Peter wasn't just riding the bench,

104
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,460
 he was off the team. And yet Jesus comes to him and says, "Hey man, I've got your uniform,

105
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,780
 it's clean press, it's ready for you. Got a new role, got a new mission. Let's get back in the

106
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,420
 game together." And so that's where we find ourselves here in our story. And this is just

107
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:10,540
 an aside, but what you need to know is Peter in this moment has just received a massive dispensing

108
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:17,420
 of God's grace in his life. And what it's done for him is it's brought him closer to God than he was

109
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,380
 before. You see, your failures will bring you closer to Jesus than your successes ever will.

110
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,780
 And some of you just need to know that. That's not even a part of the lesson. That's for free.

111
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:37,580
 And yet it's important to know that Peter has just received so much grace as we come to verse 18.

112
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:47,740
 It says this, "Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and

113
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:53,820
 walk wherever you wanted. But when you're old, you will stretch out your hands and another will

114
00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:00,060
 dress you and carry you where you do not want to go. This he said to show by what kind of death

115
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,820
 he," talking about Peter, "was to glorify God. And after saying this, he said to him, 'Follow me.'

116
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:11,500
 Peter turned and he saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following him, the one who had also leaned

117
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,940
 back against him during the supper and had said, 'Lord, who is it that's going to betray you?'

118
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:22,220
 That disciple's name is John. When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, 'Lord, what about this guy?

119
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:27,100
 What about this man?' And then Jesus said to him, 'If it's my will that he remain until I come,

120
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:35,260
 what is that to you? You follow me.'" You see, Jesus has just reinstated Peter. He's confirmed

121
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,860
 his life's purpose. He's reminded him, "Hey man, you're not only going to be a part of the church,

122
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,900
 you're going to be a massive player in leading the church." And then he takes a hard left into

123
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:50,780
 prophesying his martyrdom and telling him, "Hey man, you're going to die," which is probably not

124
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:55,820
 great conversational etiquette. And yet Jesus just wants to level with him. He wants to tell him,

125
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,580
 "Hey, you're going to die." But he not only tells him that he's going to die, he tells him how he's

126
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:04,860
 going to die. And it's not purposeless. Like we may read that and think, "Golly, man, did Jesus

127
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,940
 have no social tact, no awareness whatsoever?" I promise he did because he has a purpose in

128
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:17,820
 speaking to Peter about his own crucifixion. He's prophesying, "Hey, you're going to one day stretch

129
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:23,420
 out your arms and they will clothe you themselves. They will lead you where you do not want to go.

130
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:29,100
 You will be crucified as I myself have been crucified." And Jesus called the shot. In AD 64,

131
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,700
 Peter was crucified. History shows that he was crucified upside down because he didn't think

132
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:40,700
 himself worthy to be crucified in the same manner as his king. And yet what we find in this story

133
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,900
 is it rattles Peter a little bit, as it would any of us. You learn that you're going to die

134
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:51,820
 and it's going to be painful. It would probably induce some fear. It would probably lead you to

135
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:57,900
 worry and wonder, "God, what are you doing in my life? I just got reconciled with you. We're on a

136
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:03,020
 good page together again. What are you saying that I'm going to go to my death?" And yet Jesus has

137
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:09,500
 purpose in it because he wants Peter to know, "Hey, I am calling you to something amazing.

138
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:15,340
 I've got great purpose for your life. Great purpose, it requires great faith.

139
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:25,020
 But before you can be filled with great faith, I need to empty you of your fear first."

140
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:33,500
 That's why he evokes his fear. This is what Jesus will do. He will point out the things in our

141
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:40,300
 lives which we fear because he knows comparison feeds on fear. Comparison feeds on fear, which is

142
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:47,420
 our first point. It's unique that way because in every other area of life, we run from what we fear.

143
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:56,060
 But when it comes to comparison, we run to what we fear. Think about it like this. If you fear

144
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,660
 you're not skinny enough, then you need to watch what you eat. If you fear you're not successful

145
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,780
 enough, then you need to work harder. If you fear that you're not dateable enough, then you need to

146
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,980
 lower your standards. If you fear you're not pretty enough, then maybe you need to show some skin. Do

147
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:14,780
 you see it? When it comes to comparison, we follow what we fear, which is why it's anything but

148
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:20,140
 coincidental that right here in the face of Peter's fear, Jesus tells him, "Hey, don't follow

149
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:28,780
 your fear. You follow me. You come with me. You don't focus on that. I know that that's scary.

150
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:34,860
 I know that causes you concern. Don't focus on that. You focus on me. Keep your eyes right here.

151
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,300
 You follow after me, Peter, because the one you're focusing on is the one that you're going to follow

152
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:46,540
 after." I remember growing up, my family, we would go snow skiing. Anybody snow skiing here?

153
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,180
 We would go snow skiing, and we would always play follow the leader. It's been fun. My nieces and

154
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,780
 nephews are growing up now, and we take them out there, and we do the same thing. And the object

155
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:00,860
 of the game was whoever's in the lead, you follow them, as the name implies, follow the leader.

156
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:06,940
 And you do whatever they do. If they make a turn, you make a turn. If they move through trees,

157
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,420
 you move with them. If they decide to ski backwards, then you better turn around and

158
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:17,180
 ski backwards as well. If they're pulling 360s, you need to spend some 360s yourself. You follow

159
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:24,940
 them however and wherever they go, because that's how you win. Like the secret to winning follow the

160
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:31,820
 leader is you keep your eyes dead set on the leader in front of you, and you faithfully follow them

161
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:38,460
 wherever they lead. We're supposed to do the same thing with Jesus. The words "follow me," if you

162
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,900
 read through the gospels, they appear 13 different times. And every time someone hears the words

163
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:52,300
 "follow me," there's a common theme associated to that command. You're going to have an immediate

164
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:59,340
 detachment from self-interest. Like you're going to set aside your self-interest in pursuit of

165
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,260
 something different. People gave up their livelihood, they left their homes, they quit

166
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:09,500
 their jobs, they abandoned all comfort to follow Jesus, which sounds really crazy. Amen? Like can

167
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,420
 any of us agree with that? Like golly, I don't know that any invitation in life is going to be

168
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:18,540
 worthy of that, of me abandoning everything I've worked hard for, of all the family that I dearly

169
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,340
 love, of all the comfort that I so enjoy to have. Like I don't know that anything is going to be

170
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:29,820
 worth giving up. And yet what you see, and this is what's crazy, when you follow Jesus,

171
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:37,020
 the reward of gaining him is far greater than anything you give up.

172
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:46,620
 And so Jesus is calling Peter, "Hey, I'm going to give you so much more than you will ever be

173
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,380
 able to gain on your own, but it's going to require you to follow after me. You're going

174
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:56,620
 to have to detach yourself from some things you care about." Jesus says the same idea in Matthew

175
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:02,940
 16. He says, "Then Jesus said to his disciples, 'If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself

176
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,020
 and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever

177
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:12,860
 loses his life for my sake will find it.'" What's comparison say instead? If the voice of truth is

178
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,420
 saying, "Hey, if you lose your life, you'll find it," comparison's voice is going to say instead,

179
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:23,580
 "Hey, you're actually losing life. So you don't need to give more life away. You need to get out

180
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,700
 there and find some life. Like you need to hustle after it. You're getting left behind. You better

181
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,660
 rise and grind, baby. Like you better get to work because you have some deficiencies in your life

182
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,140
 and you're the one that's going to have to make up the difference." This is what comparison would

183
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,460
 say to you. Like you need to accumulate some followers on Instagram. You need to get some

184
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:47,500
 more matches on Hinge. You need to get some more travel scheduled on the calendar. You need to get

185
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,460
 another promotion at work. You need to, whatever it is, you need to accumulate for yourself because

186
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:59,580
 you're deficient as you are. You're not enough as is. And so I guess we better find a way to make

187
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:05,180
 you into that much more of what you think you need to be. That's what comparison would say.

188
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:12,700
 And yet what's crazy about comparison is yes, it's a fear-based response, but it's a really bad

189
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:19,340
 fear-based response. Like a good fear-based response leads you away from danger, but that's

190
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:25,820
 not what comparison does. Comparison doesn't lead you away from danger. It puts you in danger. It's

191
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:33,100
 really bad advice. It's like me saying, "There are few vitamins in cookies, and therefore you should

192
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:41,340
 eat many of them." That's horrible advice. Like I'm promising you a path to hell, and yet what's

193
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:48,300
 going to happen is unhealth. That's how this works. That's what comparison's promise looks like.

194
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:57,180
 So what do we do when comparison comes creeping? We follow Jesus. It's that simple. We follow him.

195
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,900
 Like we identify where we feel secure, and rather than make up the difference on our own,

196
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:10,140
 we look at the one who made up the difference on his own. That's what we do. We follow that man.

197
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:15,660
 We don't follow after any other. We stop being fearful. We start being faithful. Faithful with

198
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:22,060
 where God has me. Faithful with what God's calling me to do. Faithful to speak what God's asking me

199
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:27,980
 to say. Faithful to do whatever it is he wants me to do with my life. Because if my life

200
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,780
 is hidden with Christ, then my life is no longer my own. It's Christ that lives in me.

201
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:38,620
 He gets to do with me what he wants. He gets to lead me where he wishes. I will be faithful to

202
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:44,380
 follow that man. You see, we have to make sure we're following the right person. So porch,

203
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:51,500
 who are you following right now? Who are you following? And here's the thing, like I felt this

204
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:57,340
 as I was preparing to teach this message. There's nothing about comparison I can tell you that you

205
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:04,540
 may not already well know. Like this is an old idea. Sure, I want to present it in a new way,

206
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:11,020
 and yet my goal is just to take this concept of comparison, put it back on the table for us to

207
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:17,020
 consider and call you to take responsibility where it has run amok in your life. That's what I want

208
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:22,220
 to do tonight. That's what I'm striving after. And so if you're following after the wrong person,

209
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:28,220
 then the responsibility is yours to change what's in your power to change.

210
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,420
 So what does that look like? Well, for some of you, it means you need to go into your

211
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:38,540
 social media and you actually need to consider who is it that I'm following. And let me remove

212
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,020
 anyone that I'm following that I don't meaningfully interact with on a regular basis,

213
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:48,540
 because I'm not following them because they're a friend. I'm following them because they're a goal.

214
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:55,500
 And my goal is the upper call of Christ. Let me get rid of that. For others of us, it means

215
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,060
 slashing our shopping budget in half, and we need to quit liking to know it.

216
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,780
 And we just need to choose instead, like to know him.

217
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:13,100
 Others of us, we need to really ask the question as we consider the photos we post on Instagram,

218
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:20,540
 like, man, why am I posting whatever I'm posting? Because you know, you don't need to

219
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:24,220
 coincidentally place your engagement ring in every single photo.

220
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:30,780
 Like you don't need to carefully craft your picture so that that name brand is included,

221
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,500
 is included so everybody else can see you can't actually associate with that sort of wealth.

222
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:44,860
 Some of us, it's not social media or public perception at all. It's private perception.

223
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,980
 Like rather than worrying about the real that's going across your social media,

224
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,220
 you need to think about the real that's playing through your mind. And you need to consider the

225
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,620
 fact that the conversation you had with that person, you don't need to keep replaying it over

226
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:04,060
 and over and over again. Like you can let those things go, you can move on, even though you think

227
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:08,140
 that you said something stupid or you sounded really dumb or you wish you could take that thing

228
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,740
 back because now what are they going to think of me? Like I'm never going to be able to associate

229
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:17,900
 with those specific people. And some of us here, we're long-time believers.

230
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:23,660
 And the topic of comparison comes up and we think we're good, man. Like I already followed Jesus,

231
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,500
 that command, I'm already registering with that. If you're here and you think you're safe from

232
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:33,020
 comparison because you already follow Jesus, let me just level with you. If Peter's not safe,

233
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:40,460
 you're not safe either. We see it as we keep going. It says in verse 20, "Peter turned and he

234
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,620
 saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following him, the one whom had also leaned back against him

235
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:49,180
 during the supper. And it said, 'Lord, who is it that's going to betray you?' And when Peter saw

236
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:57,580
 him, he said to Jesus, 'Lord, what about this man?'" Not even one verse after Jesus looks at Peter

237
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,140
 and is like, "Hey, follow me." Peter's like, "But what about that guy?" Like we're not even a verse

238
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:08,860
 away. And if you know Peter at all, this is true to form. This is so on brand. Like he turns around

239
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:14,780
 and what it means is he turns around is that his eyes stop focusing on following Jesus and they

240
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:22,060
 start focusing on following someone else. And it sets him up for a world of hurt. It puts him in

241
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:26,700
 a position where he's less interested in what Jesus is calling him to do. And he's more interested in

242
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:33,180
 what Jesus is calling John to do. And it jeopardizes their friendship. Because here's the

243
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:39,580
 second point. Comparison, it turns friends into rivals. Comparison turns friends into rivals.

244
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,660
 Like these two guys, they're good friends. I already said they were part of Jesus's inner

245
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:49,820
 circle and they had some really meaningful moments in life together. Like if you track what Peter and

246
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,700
 John, the two of them are explicitly a part of, what you see is these are the guys that, I mean,

247
00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:00,380
 they fished together and then they got called into Jesus's ministry together. And then they saw

248
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:06,860
 Jesus, the man, become Jesus, the son of God, as he transfigured before them. And then they made

249
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:12,460
 their way to the garden of Gethsemane and they prayed with Jesus. But that happened after they

250
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,860
 had actually gone together to prepare the Passover feast that they would share with Jesus. And then

251
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:23,180
 after Jesus died and he rose, they raced each other to the tomb. And then we find them here

252
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:28,460
 in this moment right now, where they're engaging with the resurrected Lord. And if you keep tracking

253
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,060
 their story, they have more moments like this. Like it just keeps going on and on and on and on.

254
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:36,060
 Like this is the stuff that friendships are made of. They're part of God's work in the world.

255
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,820
 They're making a difference alongside each other. And yet in the face of comparison,

256
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:45,980
 all of it is jeopardized. All of it is risked in a moment.

257
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,340
 And comparison stands to do the same thing to you and your friends.

258
00:25:53,340 --> 00:26:00,140
 Like it is laughable how quick in this story, Peter goes from following Jesus to following

259
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,620
 someone else. And yet this happens to us too. Like rather than following God's plan for our own lives,

260
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,260
 we start following God's plan for other people's lives. Like if you've ever been a social media

261
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:15,180
 sleuth, you know, you know somebody is dating that guy or that girl, or they're actually associated

262
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,460
 with that specific person that man, he would love to be associated with that person. They're so

263
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,980
 famous. They're so popular. They've got so much influence. How did they get connected to that

264
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,140
 person? Or you actually saw that person was involved with that group of people. And did you

265
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:30,540
 see the concert that they went to? That was amazing. Or man, they took that trip all together. God,

266
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:35,740
 that was awesome. If you've ever been that person and you were able to social media stalk your way

267
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,860
 into someone else's life, you have just proven my point that you are far more interested in living

268
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:46,860
 someone else's life than living the life that God has given you. We are all prone to this,

269
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:53,740
 especially in our digital age. We're so much more interested oftentimes in what God is doing

270
00:26:53,740 --> 00:27:00,300
 somewhere else than what he is doing right here at hand. Why? Why is that the case? Well,

271
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:06,060
 according to psychology and the social comparison theory, it's one of two reasons. Very simply,

272
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,980
 we compare ourselves either because we want to feel better about ourselves or because we want

273
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:15,900
 to motivate ourselves to improve. Which if I could just boil that down for you, it just simply means

274
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:22,860
 that we look at other people's lives because we're not happy with our own. Like all comparison

275
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:29,900
 with others is rooted in a discontentment with myself. That's where comparison comes from.

276
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:40,380
 Like you don't actually care if that guy gets the job. You just care that you didn't get the job.

277
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:48,140
 You actually don't care that she looks the way she does. You just care that you don't look

278
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:53,500
 the way that she does. You actually don't care that they took that trip. You just care that

279
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,540
 you didn't get to take that trip. And so here's the thing, Porch, lean in with me on this.

280
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:05,980
 Your issue is not with them. Your issue is with him. And so if you have a complaint,

281
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,060
 you need to take it with the big guy. You've got to process it with God Almighty

282
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:18,860
 because your life is your life because it's the life he wants you to live.

283
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:29,900
 But here's the danger of comparison. If we don't take it up with him, if we don't deal with God,

284
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:36,460
 then we will deal with others. And we will take the friends in our lives and we will turn them

285
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:45,500
 into rivals. That's why James says this in chapter four. He says, "You desire and you do not have.

286
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:53,420
 So what do you do? You murder. You covet. You can't obtain. So you fight and you quarrel.

287
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,820
 You do not have because you do not ask." I love that he puts it on the end. It just feels like

288
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:03,660
 a weird, like inclusion to the back end of that verse. Like you do not have because you do not

289
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:08,220
 ask. What's he saying? He's like, "Hey, all the fighting, all the quarreling, all the anger and

290
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,900
 frustration you feel towards each other, all of that is the product of you not talking to him

291
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,940
 about it." That's where it comes from. You're talking amongst yourselves when in reality,

292
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,260
 you should be talking to him. You don't have because you don't ask because you haven't gotten

293
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:26,860
 honest with the Lord. Like it's alarming. Like we will fight others and tear them down just because

294
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:32,540
 we don't have what they do. Like that's the nature of coveting. What's coveting? Coveting

295
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,500
 is a fully grown comparison. That's what comparison grows up to when it gets big, kids.

296
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:44,700
 It turns into coveting. And what happens in a coveting type of relationship is I not only want

297
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:52,540
 what you have, I resent you for having it. I hate you for having it. And we see this everywhere.

298
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:59,100
 God, just look at the news right now. Like political candidates taking cheap shots and

299
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:06,700
 low blows. Scroll through Twitter and you'll see athletes ripping each other apart. You can go and

300
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:12,300
 you can read the comment section. You'll find trolls around everywhere. We become a hater,

301
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:19,340
 which by definition, according to hip hop historians, is actually ascribed to someone

302
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:25,420
 that's jealous of someone else. That's what it means. Comparison turns friends into rivals.

303
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:32,460
 It's turning Peter against John. And it's more than likely turn some of you against your own.

304
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:40,540
 So what do we do when that happens? Well, think about the instructions that Jesus gives Peter

305
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,740
 right before we get to this section. Again, we didn't read it, but he looks at him and as he's

306
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:49,740
 restoring him, he says, "Hey, do you love me? Do you love me? Do you love me?" Asks him three times.

307
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:55,900
 And every time he asks, Peter says, "You know that I do." And Jesus' response is, "Then feed my sheep.

308
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:03,020
 Do you love me? Then feed my sheep." What does that mean? Love my people, serve my people,

309
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:09,820
 help my people. Like it's odd for a shepherd to see a sheep that's struggling and choose

310
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:17,820
 to revel in their misery. That's a weird thing. Or it's strange for a shepherd to see a sheep

311
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:24,140
 thriving and hate them for the green grass they eat off of. That is odd. That doesn't make any

312
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:29,820
 sense. And to the watching world, it is odd when the people of God that claim to love their Lord

313
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:38,940
 do not love one another. It's strange. It's weird. It's odd because it's not what we've been called

314
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:46,140
 to. We're supposed to love one another. Romans 12 says it like this, "Rejoice with those who rejoice

315
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:51,100
 and weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another. Don't be haughty, but associate

316
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,820
 with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight. Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to

317
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:01,980
 do what is honorable in the sight of all." Do what's honorable. Like that's the mark of a true

318
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:09,980
 Christian. You do what's honorable. So when someone actually achieves something significant,

319
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:19,180
 it is not honorable to hate them for their achievement, to wish ill behind their back

320
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:24,700
 because they actually found themselves in some sort of favor that they may not have sought after

321
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:30,620
 on their own. Like it's odd. That's not honorable. That's jealous. Like if you get upset because

322
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:36,140
 someone gets ahead, that's not honorable either. That's jealousy. If you delight in the misfortune

323
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:40,300
 of someone else, that's not honorable. That's jealousy. And it looks weird on God's people.

324
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:47,020
 We are called to celebrate with those who celebrate. We rejoice with those who rejoice. We

325
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:52,140
 hurt with those who hurt. We weep with those who weep. That is our response to one another. We

326
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:59,180
 serve each other like that. I remember my sophomore year, I just made the conscious decision. It was

327
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:06,300
 a defining moment where I made the call that I was going to be less worried about whether or not

328
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:11,260
 people loved me. And I was going to be far more concerned whether or not I loved them.

329
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:18,460
 And you know what happened? Things started changing for me. Like my confidence grew.

330
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:24,940
 My friends started to increase. I started to get access into things that I had not had access into

331
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:31,580
 before. I started to have fun that I wasn't a part of previously. Like I started to find myself

332
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:37,980
 enjoying the kind of life that I wished I had enjoyed before. Why? Was it because I gained the

333
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,700
 system? I know how this works. I need to give them a little bit so they'll give me a little bit back.

334
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:51,100
 Quid pro quo. This for that. No, that's not what I was doing. I just started caring for people.

335
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:57,100
 And listen, this is not an example of my perfection. Follow me as I follow. That's

336
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:02,220
 not what I'm doing. But I am just telling you, as your care for others goes up,

337
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:10,140
 your comparison to others will go down. If you start thinking about how you can serve others,

338
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:16,300
 you'll stop worrying about whether or not you're getting served. You start worrying about whether

339
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:21,660
 or not others feel enjoyed, you'll stop worrying about whether or not you are enjoyable. Because

340
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:27,260
 you feed sheep, just as Jesus commanded Peter. Loving others, it liberates us from comparing

341
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:33,660
 to others. It saves our friends from becoming our rivals. But that's not all. Our third point is in

342
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:38,940
 these final few verses. Look at 21 with me. When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, "Lord, what about

343
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:45,100
 this man?" And Jesus said to him, "If it's my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?

344
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:52,140
 You follow me." So the saying spread abroad among the brothers that this disciple was not to die,

345
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:56,860
 yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die. But if it's my will that he remain until I

346
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,380
 come, what is that to you? Third and final point that we need to learn if we're going to overcome

347
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,500
 comparison is we need to know that comparison will rob you of joy. Comparison will rob you of joy,

348
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:12,380
 which you've heard before. You're a smart bunch. You know comparison is the thief of all joy.

349
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,540
 And the reality is the Bible would agree with that sentiment. While it's subtle in this text,

350
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:21,340
 it's nonetheless true that so long as Peter is trapped in comparison, he will never experience

351
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:28,060
 the kind of joy he longs for. Why is that? Because joy is found in one place and one place alone,

352
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:32,780
 and that is with the person of Jesus. If I am following after someone else,

353
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:39,500
 then I am no longer following after Christ, which means I'm no longer following after my joy. I will

354
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:48,540
 not find joy anywhere else. You know this. Look at your own life. If you trace those behaviors

355
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:55,180
 where you seem to find some sense of sensory satisfaction and momentary pleasure and delight,

356
00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:01,340
 it always fades. It always abates, and you always have to return. You know it to be true.

357
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:07,100
 But with Christ, that's not the case. And so Jesus is looking at Peter, and he's like,

358
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:13,180
 "Don't worry about him. Follow me." It's easy to read this and to think, "Man,

359
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,460
 Jesus is pretty irritated." That's how I read it. Did you all read it that way? Like, "Man,

360
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,500
 Jesus is really annoyed with Peter. He's the kid that won't take out the trash, and he has to be

361
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,540
 told over and over and over again." How many times do I have to tell you, Peter? Come on, man.

362
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:26,780
 Get on board with what I'm trying to do here. And listen, I don't know if Jesus is irritated or

363
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:32,460
 isn't irritated, but what I do know is Jesus is full of compassion. And that's what we should

364
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:39,660
 read into this text. Because as he looks at Peter, he says, "Hey, why are you worried about my plans

365
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:46,620
 for his life? I've got plans for yours. Why are you worried about what I'm doing with John? I'm

366
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:51,580
 going to do something with you. Don't worry about my purposes for him, Peter. I've got purposes for

367
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:56,460
 your life. I'm doing something significant. I want to take you somewhere special. I'm going to make

368
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:04,700
 something great of my glory through your life. Trust me. Walk with me. Follow me." And he's saying

369
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:12,300
 the same thing to some of us here. Some of us are so ensnared to comparison, and yet where comparison's

370
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:18,140
 voice wants to lead you astray, compassion's voice is saying, "Come here where joy and delight and

371
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:25,660
 fullness of life is found. It's with me. So walk with me." Jesus doesn't want Peter to be so

372
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,940
 mesmerized with John's life that he misses his own, and he doesn't want us to miss ours either.

373
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:37,580
 Because here's the crazy thing about comparison. When we're comparing ourself to someone else,

374
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:43,100
 when we're observing their life, yes, we are not truly able to live our own, but where we

375
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:49,740
 wish to have what they have, we miss what God has already given. And I promise the gifts of God in

376
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:57,420
 your life, they're better than you think. They're deeper than you've already delved to find. They're

377
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:05,820
 richer than you dare dream they may be. He's that good. He really truly is. Call his bluff and see

378
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:12,460
 if he won't surprise you. He's telling you, "Come with me. I'm where joy is found." Think about the

379
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:20,460
 greatest showman. The entire movie is about what? It's about the pursuit of one P.T. Barnum that

380
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,500
 desperately wants to be associated with a people that he is not naturally associated with. He wants

381
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,380
 to be a part of the upper class, like the ruling elite, the socialites. I want to be up there. And

382
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:38,940
 so what does he do? He lives his entire life to get to that end. And what you find, spoiler alert,

383
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:48,220
 is he achieves that end and there's no joy there. None. He loses all joy. This guy was bursting with

384
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:56,140
 life. And then you see he finds himself in the halls of power and he's miserable. His family's

385
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:01,340
 disheveled. His life is falling apart because he wasn't living the life God gave him. He was living

386
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:08,460
 someone else's life. And what you find at the end of the movie is after he hits rock bottom and

387
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:15,420
 everything is stripped away from him, the people that God had given him originally were still there

388
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:21,260
 with him. And his joy returned because he was back to living the way God wanted him to be.

389
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:27,340
 This is the invitation on the table for you. Don't fall prey to comparison.

390
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:35,180
 Instead, walk with Jesus. You see, to be ensnared by comparison is to be enslaved to dissatisfaction.

391
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,700
 Like comparison is always discouraging because someone inevitably ends up on

392
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:45,660
 bottom. But when we stop focusing on what we don't have and we start focusing on what we do have,

393
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:52,620
 namely that we have Jesus, we find all the joy we've been looking for. Psalm 1611 says,

394
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,540
 "You make known to me the path of life in your presence, God, there's fullness of joy

395
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:01,820
 at your right hand where Christ Jesus sits our pleasures forevermore." Psalm 107.9, "For he

396
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:09,580
 satisfies the longing soul." Do you have a longing soul? He'll satisfy it. "The hungry soul he fills

397
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:16,140
 with good things." Psalm 63, 5-6, "My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food, and my mouth

398
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:21,420
 will praise you with joyful lips when I remember you upon my bed and meditate on you in the watches

399
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:27,180
 of the night." Friends, we have every reason to be grateful because this is true. And listen to me,

400
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:32,940
 I know that some of you are here tonight and you're desperately trying to hold fast to this truth.

401
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:39,020
 You know, my response as I walk with God is I should be grateful.

402
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:47,820
 But it's so hard given what I have. It feels like I'm so unseen, I'm so unheard, I feel lost and

403
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:57,180
 alone. And so I know I'm supposed to be grateful. I should rejoice. And yet knowing full well that's

404
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:03,500
 what I should be, I feel like a fraud. I feel like a fake. I feel like a hypocrite. Can I just

405
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,300
 encourage you if that's you here in the room, gratitude is a state of being more than a state

406
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:14,700
 of feeling. It's a state of being more than a state of feeling. If you are in Christ Jesus,

407
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:21,580
 then your being, the very essence of your identity is put you in a position where gratitude is

408
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:27,820
 possible. And I'll level with the rest of you, if you don't know him, then your state of being is

409
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:35,900
 one where gratitude is impossible. True gratitude, unfettered joy, it's found nowhere else but in

410
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:46,220
 this man. Friends, when we read words like this from Jesus as less harsh and more compassionate,

411
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:52,140
 we can feel that same voice speaking to us tonight. Like what's it to you if he has more

412
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:59,100
 favor with your boss than you? Like what's it to you if she has the kind of life you've always

413
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:04,220
 wished for? What's it to you if they are in a loving dating relationship and you can't seem

414
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:08,460
 to find someone? What's it to you if they're more popular even though they're less godly?

415
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:19,660
 What's it to you? You follow me. I'm the satisfier of life. I'm the giver of full joy.

416
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:29,020
 I'm the one that will leave you wanting nevermore. You follow me, trust me, walk with me,

417
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:35,260
 and see the kind of joy, the fullness of life I will give you. Because comparison will rob you of

418
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:42,220
 joy, but my compassion, it stands ready to offer it without end. How do we know that this is all true?

419
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:50,380
 Because Jesus Christ has proven this is the case. Like where comparison feeds on fear,

420
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:57,420
 Christ's compassion has freed us from fear. When we were the enemies of God, all of us lost and

421
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:05,100
 gone astray in our sin, dejected from his presence and separated forevermore, Jesus said that is not

422
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:12,060
 satisfactory for me. I will do whatever it takes to get you back, to pull you close, to be reunited

423
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:18,460
 in right relationship with you, and so I will step in and where comparison would lead you off in fear,

424
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:26,220
 I will lead myself to you and bring you back to me where I am. Where comparison turns friends

425
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:33,420
 into rivals. Christ's compassion has turned rivals into friends. He's taken those that hated God and

426
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:40,620
 he has brought them in and made them lovers of God. He has taken the lonely and the lost and he's made

427
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:45,260
 them sons and he's made them daughters for those that see his life and see he is born the full

428
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:50,940
 consequence of my sin. He rose from the dead so that I might have life and life forevermore should

429
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:57,740
 I place my faith in him. And where comparison robs you of joy, tonight friends, Christ's compassion

430
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:02,860
 stands ready to offer it to you forevermore. Do you want joy? Then don't look anywhere else.

431
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:10,700
 Look to him because he's been looking for you for so long. Let me pray for us. God we love you.

432
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:20,380
 Thankful God for an evening to sit in your word. So grateful God that there's not a single soul

433
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:33,100
 here tonight that is too far gone, that has done too much wrong, that is filled with deficiencies

434
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:41,900
 you God cannot fill through your son. I pray Lord, like I want my friends to experience the kind of

435
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:48,460
 joy I know you give. Not just because I can reason with it theologically or I can point

436
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:53,260
 to it experientially but God I have felt it personally.

437
00:44:53,260 --> 00:45:02,860
 Please Lord for those here that feel insufficient, inadequate, not enough as they already are,

438
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:09,660
 would they look to Jesus and see one that says you're exactly as I want you.

439
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:14,460
 The good, the bad, and the ugly, the most cringe-worthy parts of yourself,

440
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:19,340
 they could not keep me from you and they will not keep me from you now.

441
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:24,860
 We love you God. It's in Christ Jesus name we pray. Amen.
