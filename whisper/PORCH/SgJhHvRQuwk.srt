1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:25,760
 I want to start with a question for you.

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,840
 Have you ever tried out for something

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
 and had to wait to find out if you got in?

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,240
 Okay, like you're like in that waiting,

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,120
 like I don't know if they've accepted me,

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,320
 I don't know if I'm getting in.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,200
 And so maybe it was a date, right?

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,120
 You go on a date and the date's over

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,360
 and he's like, I'll call you.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,240
 And you're like, okay, when?

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,240
 When are you gonna, like, did it go?

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,080
 I thought it went well, did it go well?

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,600
 It seemed like it went well, you know?

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,560
 Or maybe you went on a date and you texted her

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,680
 and it's like, hey, had fun, love to hang out again.

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,100
 And you see those three dots and then they disappear.

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,720
 And you're like, what's up with that?

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,760
 Like, and you're waiting to find out

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,640
 if you've been accepted.

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,840
 And maybe it was, you know, applying for a college, right?

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,360
 So maybe you apply at your favorite university,

23
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,880
 you send in your application to A&M

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,440
 and you're waiting to see if you, whoops,

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,080
 you're waiting to see if you got in

26
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,520
 or maybe it was Baylor, right?

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,760
 Or maybe UT.

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,040
 They accept everybody, they accept everybody.

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,800
 And you're waiting, you're waiting to find out

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,560
 if you got in, if you got accepted.

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,520
 Or maybe it was a job interview, right?

32
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,280
 You finish the interview, you put on your best,

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,560
 you know, you did everything you could

34
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,960
 and you leave and it's just that waiting period.

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,660
 Was I good enough, did I say the right things?

36
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,000
 I wonder how many people they're gonna take in.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,800
 Am I gonna get in?

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,880
 Will they accept me?

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,720
 I went to an interview once,

40
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,040
 it was actually for a reality show

41
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,880
 called "The Apprentice," okay?

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,200
 Now I don't know if you've heard of "The Apprentice,"

43
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,320
 but I tried out for this, it was in Fort Worth,

44
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,680
 tryouts were in Fort Worth.

45
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,760
 And so my wife and I go out there,

46
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,440
 it was a while ago, long before ministry

47
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,200
 or a little bit before ministry.

48
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,600
 And so that's why I'm in ministry.

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,640
 And so I go out there to Fort Worth

50
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,920
 and there's thousands and thousands and thousands

51
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,000
 of people trying, I'm like, I don't have a shot, you know?

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,760
 And I go in there and I did everything I could,

53
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,080
 you know, I was bold and had my best suit on

54
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,120
 and was trying to get on the show.

55
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,480
 And afterwards they said,

56
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,120
 "Hey, we'll let you know today if you made it."

57
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,360
 And so Monica and I went out in Fort Worth,

58
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,320
 we went to Sundance Square, we had a blast,

59
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,640
 just we went and saw a movie.

60
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,200
 I remember we went to Barnes and Nobles,

61
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,900
 then we went to this comedy club

62
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,600
 and then we were hanging out for a late dinner.

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,120
 And I say late dinner 'cause the sun had set

64
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,140
 and I still didn't get a call.

65
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,480
 And I'm like, I wonder if I got in.

66
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,040
 And then at like 11.55 at night,

67
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,240
 they said they'd let me know that day,

68
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,800
 they called and they said,

69
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,900
 "Hey, you made it to the next round."

70
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,880
 And I'm like, this is crazy

71
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,920
 because this is life changing, right?

72
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,080
 This is like, we're gonna move to New York

73
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,440
 and I'm gonna be on this show

74
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,080
 and this could just be crazy for me.

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,800
 And so I go back to the second interview, the callback,

76
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,840
 and it was in this hotel.

77
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,720
 And I remember kind of going through the same thing,

78
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,060
 this time it was on camera

79
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,820
 and I was answering these questions.

80
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,180
 And they said, "All right, we'll let you know something."

81
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,900
 They're like, "We'll call you."

82
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,320
 And I'm like, "You'll call me when?

83
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,540
 "When are you gonna call me?"

84
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,700
 And I just remember that waiting period thinking,

85
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,940
 hey, my whole life is in their hands.

86
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,620
 My whole future's in their hands.

87
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,900
 And they're gonna let me know what my future looks like.

88
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,180
 I don't know if you've ever had this experience.

89
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,820
 Maybe it was just a job interview.

90
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,740
 Long story short, I didn't make it

91
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,280
 past that second round.

92
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,140
 Oh, I know.

93
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,460
 (congregation laughing)

94
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:02,300
 But I think this is how we, at some subconscious level

95
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,380
 in the back of our minds, feel about heaven.

96
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,500
 It's like, hey, it's this place.

97
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,140
 Can anybody really know if you go there

98
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,880
 what you need to do to get there?

99
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,940
 Maybe all roads lead there.

100
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,420
 If you follow your religion well, you get there.

101
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,260
 What about the person who's never heard?

102
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,460
 If I'm saved, am I always saved?

103
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,040
 Can you lose your salvation?

104
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,500
 All of these things, like how do I know

105
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,140
 that I'm going to get to heaven?

106
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,740
 So we're in this series asking for a friend,

107
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,780
 and tonight is can anyone really know

108
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,860
 they're getting into heaven?

109
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,420
 Can anyone really know they're getting into heaven?

110
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,840
 And so much more is at stake with this question

111
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,060
 than just the uneasiness of wondering

112
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,340
 if you got a job or not.

113
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,380
 Or a second date or not.

114
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,260
 Or into a university or not.

115
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,540
 And in fact, the largest belief amongst our peers

116
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,060
 is that all roads lead to heaven.

117
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,860
 And so this comes from Jen Iy, these stats.

118
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,820
 It says, although 65% classify themselves as Christians,

119
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,540
 43% said it doesn't matter what religious faith you follow

120
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,380
 because they all teach the same lessons.

121
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,460
 70% of all major Christian

122
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,500
 and non-Christian religious groups say

123
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,460
 many religions can lead to eternal life.

124
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,020
 And 68% say there's more than one true way

125
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,620
 to interpret the teachings of my religion.

126
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,380
 68%.

127
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,940
 50% believe that all people are eventually saved

128
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,660
 or accepted by God no matter what they do.

129
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,540
 Theology called inclusivism.

130
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,900
 We covered universalism.

131
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,200
 This idea that everyone gets there.

132
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,800
 Some people believe, well, pretty much,

133
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,400
 you just need to be good and you're good with God.

134
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,180
 Right?

135
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,220
 One way to heaven is too exclusive.

136
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,320
 I mean, that can't be true.

137
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,980
 Can't all roads eventually lead to God?

138
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,160
 What about people who never hear?

139
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,620
 What about people of other faith who are sincere?

140
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,460
 I remember when I had a crisis of the faith,

141
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,340
 God actually used this

142
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,960
 to bring me into a relationship with him.

143
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,140
 I thought, what are the odds

144
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,800
 I'd be born to the right country?

145
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,540
 I was thinking about this, I was wrestling with this.

146
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,460
 I was like, I know there's a God,

147
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,500
 but I don't know who he is.

148
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,980
 It was agnostic.

149
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,420
 I was like, if I was born in India, I'd be Hindu.

150
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,560
 If I was born in China, I'd be Buddhist.

151
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,420
 If I was born in Iran, I'd be Muslim.

152
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,820
 If I was born in Israel, I might be Jewish.

153
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,140
 And so what are the odds that I'd be born to America

154
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,820
 and that that would be the right religion?

155
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,300
 And so I really began to research it

156
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,100
 with a bias against Christianity.

157
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,320
 And I don't know if your faith is just your parents' faith.

158
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,800
 I don't know how you came to a belief in Jesus Christ

159
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,840
 if you have, but I pray you sincerely wrestle with it

160
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,480
 if you haven't.

161
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,200
 As we dive into this message

162
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
 that you'd have a greater understanding

163
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,360
 of this way, the scripture says.

164
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,600
 And so as we move through John chapter 14,

165
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,320
 we're going to look at how Christianity is exclusive,

166
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,500
 how Christianity is inclusive.

167
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,040
 And before you leave here this evening,

168
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,040
 how Christianity offers certainty for you.

169
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,960
 And so what's happening in John chapter 14,

170
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,920
 I'll start in verse one.

171
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,160
 And in chapter 13, Jesus is saying,

172
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,660
 "Hey, I'm going to go somewhere."

173
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,640
 And his disciples say, "Well, where are you going to go?

174
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,200
 "Where, why are you leaving us?"

175
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,080
 And Peter like bows up to him, you know,

176
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,280
 'cause Peter's crazy.

177
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,580
 And he's like, "Jesus, hey, wherever you go, I'm going.

178
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,020
 "You're not going anywhere without me.

179
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,240
 "Take me with you."

180
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,500
 And Jesus is like, "Calm down, boys, calm down.

181
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,900
 "Listen, do not let your hearts be troubled.

182
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,820
 "You believe in God, believe also in me.

183
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,440
 "My father's house has many rooms.

184
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,480
 "If that were not so, I would have told you,

185
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,840
 "would I have told you that I am going there

186
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,900
 "to prepare a place for you.

187
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,820
 "And if I go and prepare a place for you,

188
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,100
 "I will come back and take you to be with me,

189
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,740
 "that you also may be where I am.

190
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,060
 "You know the way to the place where I'm going."

191
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,820
 And now Thomas speaks of, this is Doubting Thomas,

192
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,960
 "Wait, wait, wait, Lord, no, we don't.

193
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,300
 "How do we know?

194
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,260
 "We don't know where you're going.

195
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,180
 "How would we know how to get there?"

196
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,420
 And Jesus answered,

197
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,220
 "I am the way,

198
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,300
 "and the truth,

199
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,160
 "and the life.

200
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:29,660
 "No one comes to the Father except through me."

201
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,460
 So we're gonna look at this passage

202
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,540
 and we'll work backwards.

203
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,600
 My first point from the text is that Christianity

204
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,660
 is exclusive.

205
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,660
 That means there is one way to heaven,

206
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,260
 and his name is Jesus.

207
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,780
 To believe that the Bible is true

208
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,740
 is to believe that Jesus is the only way to God.

209
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,980
 And we really spelled this out in the Afterlife series,

210
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,340
 but I just want you to hear from me.

211
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,520
 There's two eternal destinations.

212
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,200
 Everyone will live somewhere forever.

213
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,420
 There's hell and there's heaven, okay?

214
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,800
 Those are the only two eternal destinations that exist.

215
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,800
 And Jesus came here, he lived a perfect life,

216
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,540
 and he died the death that we deserve,

217
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,180
 paying the price for our sins.

218
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,860
 He rose from the grave,

219
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,380
 and if we accept that payment for our sins,

220
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,020
 then we can be with him in his kingdom

221
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,900
 forever and ever and ever,

222
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,500
 and his kingdom is heaven.

223
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,020
 And so in hell, we suffer for our sins,

224
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,660
 and we don't have to suffer for our sins

225
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,000
 if we believe that Jesus suffered for our sins.

226
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,560
 And so you say, well, I believe essentially

227
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,760
 all religions lead to God.

228
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,520
 Different paths up the mountain.

229
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,320
 Aren't we kind of looking at the same thing

230
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
 from different perspectives?

231
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,640
 Anybody ever heard this?

232
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,200
 Anybody ever heard someone say this?

233
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,440
 I believe always.

234
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,820
 Lydia, if you've shared your faith,

235
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,640
 you've bumped into this objection before.

236
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,040
 You've never heard anyone say this

237
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,040
 who has actually studied world religion.

238
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,620
 Okay, this is the statement of naivety.

239
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,040
 It is from someone who hasn't looked at

240
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,440
 what actual the world religions teach.

241
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,360
 And so let me just show you quickly, as quickly as I can,

242
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,740
 we'll start with Islam.

243
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,760
 This comes from the two holy books,

244
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,000
 or the holy book of Islam, the Quran,

245
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,340
 and from two different chapters.

246
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,300
 The first one is from the Ali Imran, chapter three,

247
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,080
 verse 85, it says this.

248
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,320
 Whoever prefers a religion other than Islam,

249
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,080
 it shall definitely not be accepted from him,

250
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,800
 and in the hereafter, he shall be among the losers.

251
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,800
 This is from the Al-Maida, chapter five, verse 72,

252
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,080
 and it says this.

253
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,920
 Listen.

254
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,120
 They have certainly disbelieved who say Allah

255
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,440
 is the Messiah, the son of Mary.

256
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,000
 It's very specific.

257
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,520
 Allah has forbidden him paradise,

258
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,600
 and his refuge is the fire.

259
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,400
 Whoever believes that God is the son of Mary

260
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,000
 is going to hell, and Jesus is God, the son of Mary,

261
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,440
 and they can both be true.

262
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,200
 That's nonsensical, it's illogical, it makes no sense.

263
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,320
 Hinduism, right, says this.

264
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,080
 This is from Krishna, the Hindu force of the universe,

265
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,720
 speaking from their holy book, the Bhagavad Gita.

266
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,960
 It says this.

267
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,120
 Those who are without faith in my teaching

268
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,480
 cannot attain Krishna or the enlightenment.

269
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,880
 I permeate all the universe in my unmanifest form.

270
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,760
 All beings exist within me.

271
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,200
 If you do not accept this view, that you do not exist,

272
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,960
 you will never achieve Hindu salvation.

273
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,500
 And not only is the path different,

274
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,840
 but the destination's different,

275
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,700
 in that Hindus don't believe in heaven,

276
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,760
 but reincarnation, that you would come back

277
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,040
 as a person of nobility, or a rat,

278
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,760
 or some sort of animal in between.

279
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,580
 So you not just have different paths,

280
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,920
 but different destinations.

281
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,000
 You say those are both right, both true.

282
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,720
 Hold on, am I going to heaven,

283
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,560
 or am I going to come back to life as someone else?

284
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,960
 What's true?

285
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,760
 Buddhism, but that's inclusive, right?

286
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,560
 Buddhism is inclusive, is the only path.

287
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,160
 There is none other for the purification of insight.

288
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,160
 Walking upon this path will make an end of suffering.

289
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,360
 This is from the Buddhist holy writings.

290
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,540
 Oddly enough called the way.

291
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,340
 And then in the Jewish tradition,

292
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,280
 exclusivity manifests in the concept of the chosen people,

293
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,580
 in which anyone who does not accept the teachings

294
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,360
 of Jewish monotheism is excluded

295
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,920
 from the messianic world to come.

296
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,920
 They are exclusively God's people.

297
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,840
 And so what I want you to see, friends,

298
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,000
 is Christianity is indeed exclusive.

299
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,480
 Every world religion is indeed exclusive.

300
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,280
 And so to say that they're all right out of love

301
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,600
 is really to say that they're all wrong.

302
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,040
 If you say anyone who says, well, they're all right,

303
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,340
 hasn't looked at them.

304
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,720
 It's to say that they're all wrong.

305
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,400
 It is a statement, as I said, of naivety.

306
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,920
 And so why do we get to this place where we're like,

307
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,040
 well, I just think everyone gets to God someday.

308
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,940
 I'll tell you why.

309
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,680
 'Cause you've been sitting on the back of a tailgate

310
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,420
 after a couple of shots of Patron,

311
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,040
 been drinking, everybody becomes deep theologians

312
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,600
 at three in the morning, okay?

313
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
 (congregation laughing)

314
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,180
 Like that's when it's like, I love you, man.

315
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,020
 I love you too.

316
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,360
 I know we just met, man, I love you.

317
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,160
 You know who else loves you?

318
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,720
 God loves you, man.

319
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,960
 He wouldn't send you to hell.

320
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,460
 Nope, not you.

321
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,180
 I think everybody gets in, man.

322
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,680
 Everybody just seems right.

323
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,620
 That's what we do.

324
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,840
 That's what we do.

325
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,440
 And what's it birthed out of?

326
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,680
 What book you point to?

327
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,760
 What ancient writings?

328
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,200
 What person came from heaven,

329
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,480
 came here and told you that?

330
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
 Your feelings.

331
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,040
 Well, I just feel.

332
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,480
 I just think, right?

333
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,600
 I just, and it's all like in the statement

334
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,520
 of higher education.

335
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,480
 No, it's not.

336
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,040
 It actually doesn't make sense, right?

337
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,560
 And the problem with these feelings is Proverbs 14, 12,

338
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,840
 which says there's a way that seems right to a person.

339
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,800
 There's a way that feels right to a person,

340
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,280
 but in the end, it leads to death.

341
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,500
 Where else can you give somebody instruction?

342
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,800
 And they're like, hey, how do I get to your house?

343
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,060
 Like, oh, just pick a road, man.

344
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,480
 You'll get there one way.

345
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,740
 Like that doesn't, that logic doesn't stretch to anything.

346
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,480
 I was in London recently,

347
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,840
 David and I both were in London together

348
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,880
 and we didn't rent a car.

349
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,760
 We took the tube.

350
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,320
 The tube is the subway in London,

351
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,620
 the underground railroad and underground railway in London.

352
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,720
 And so we took the tube from the airport to the hotel

353
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,740
 and that's how we navigated London.

354
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,760
 Now the tube, this subway is very complex in London.

355
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,640
 I don't know if you've been there,

356
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,080
 but the reason I think it's more complex than New York

357
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,860
 because there's layers, like you go underground

358
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,480
 and there's stories upon stories,

359
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,840
 upon stories, upon stories of trains.

360
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,040
 And so you have to know what floor to be on first.

361
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,320
 And then when you choose the right floor,

362
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,520
 you have to be know which train to go

363
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,840
 to take you to the next stop,

364
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,840
 to get on the next floor, to take you to the train.

365
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,660
 And so like you go, I think we have a picture.

366
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,740
 So that's just like, there's just escalators

367
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,080
 upon escalators underneath the ground

368
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,340
 where you're trying to find the right floor.

369
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,620
 And so I'm with David and we're trying to figure out

370
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,520
 what's the right floor,

371
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,180
 because now we've been in London for several days

372
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,100
 and it's time to go home to catch our plane

373
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,620
 to see our family.

374
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,020
 And so we got to find the right train

375
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,380
 to take us to the airport so that we can go home

376
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,340
 and see our family and that we can make our flight, right?

377
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,660
 And so I'm there with him.

378
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,740
 I'm not very smart.

379
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,920
 I'm like, I don't know what floor.

380
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,000
 David's pretty smart though.

381
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,200
 He didn't know what floor.

382
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,200
 And so we walk up and we're looking at this map.

383
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,280
 We finally think we found the right floor,

384
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,360
 but then there's this map here and I'm looking at it.

385
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,200
 I just gave up.

386
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,540
 I'm like, dude, I don't know, man, you figure that out.

387
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,080
 And he's looking at it, right?

388
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,020
 And we're just kind of a little bit stressed

389
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,200
 because the flight, we're supposed to be there

390
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,880
 ahead of time, it's international.

391
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,160
 And I'm like, we're going to miss our flight.

392
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,240
 I want to see my girls.

393
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,320
 Now imagine if you came up to me

394
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,040
 and you loved me, man.

395
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,780
 You really, really cared about me.

396
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,020
 And you saw that I was distressed.

397
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,060
 So you said, JP, bro,

398
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,380
 any of these trains will get you to the airport.

399
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,060
 You know what I'm going to say to you?

400
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,900
 I'm going to give you a hug.

401
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,180
 I'm going to be like, if I believe you,

402
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,060
 I'm going to be like, man, that's amazing truth.

403
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,340
 Thank you so much.

404
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,820
 That really helps me because I was distressed.

405
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,780
 I was thinking I wasn't going to see my wife and my kids

406
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,860
 and I miss them.

407
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,780
 Thank you so much.

408
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,300
 Now I get on the next train

409
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,200
 because any of them are going to take me there.

410
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,240
 And some of these trains,

411
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,480
 they're straight shots to rural England.

412
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,360
 And so I get on it, it has no stop.

413
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,880
 It just takes me way, way, way out

414
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,760
 in the countryside of England, right?

415
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,320
 And I get off and there's no train back until the next day

416
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,640
 because that's how this works.

417
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,680
 I've missed my flight.

418
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,120
 It's cost me thousands and thousands of dollars,

419
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,360
 thousands and thousands of dollars to rebook.

420
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,640
 I don't get to see my family.

421
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,040
 I don't know when I'm going to get home.

422
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,940
 And all of the sudden,

423
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:26,460
 what I thought brought me relief was incredible deception.

424
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,760
 And it wasn't loving.

425
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,180
 It was not loving.

426
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,680
 You did not care well for me.

427
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,820
 What you said didn't make sense.

428
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,100
 It was birthed out of your own emotions

429
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,760
 and it put me in a bind.

430
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,940
 You can imagine when we're talking about

431
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,540
 an eternal bind, right?

432
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,060
 And so somebody says,

433
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,060
 well, I believe all religions will get there.

434
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,560
 You just respond to them like this,

435
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,720
 really, well, which one have you chosen?

436
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,260
 Because like, right,

437
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,460
 if you think all religions will get there,

438
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,660
 you're going to research them all

439
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,380
 and try to find the easiest one, right?

440
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,840
 I mean, anyone who truly believes

441
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,900
 all religions will get you there,

442
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,300
 they're going to choose Christianity

443
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,380
 because all the other ones are like,

444
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,300
 hey, do this and do this and do this and do this.

445
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,900
 Christianity is like, God did this.

446
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,200
 Like, I'll take that one.

447
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,560
 God loved me enough to allow a son to die for me

448
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,240
 so that I can be with him forever.

449
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,080
 I'll go that one.

450
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,640
 So which one have you chosen?

451
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,200
 Anyone who says all religions will get you there

452
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,920
 hasn't chosen one, right?

453
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,760
 That's what you see.

454
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,800
 That's the truth.

455
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,080
 So the reality is all religions lead to hell

456
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,960
 except one that takes you home.

457
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,760
 His name is Jesus.

458
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,480
 I've given my adult life to researching this.

459
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,480
 I found that to be true.

460
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,040
 I've looked at the archeology,

461
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,280
 the history of religions, where they originated.

462
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,580
 Don't take my word for it.

463
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,380
 You do your research.

464
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,920
 You look into it.

465
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,840
 You come to a place where you found it to be true.

466
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,720
 Jesus says, "My father's house has many rooms.

467
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,920
 "If that were not so, would I have told you

468
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,920
 "that I am going there to prepare a place for you?"

469
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,240
 My second point from this text

470
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,120
 is that Christianity is inclusive.

471
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,480
 Now that contradicts that it's exclusive, right?

472
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,080
 The reason I say it's inclusive

473
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,440
 is because everyone is invited.

474
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,540
 We've already determined that all religions are exclusive,

475
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,840
 but here's what you need to know.

476
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,280
 Christianity is the most inclusive,

477
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,320
 that Christ says, "Hey, come."

478
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,200
 That God is not slow in keeping his promises.

479
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,520
 As some understand slowness, but he's patient with you,

480
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,320
 not wanting anyone to perish,

481
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,600
 but everyone to come to eternal life.

482
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,480
 That Christianity through Christ is an invitation.

483
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,840
 Like in fact, if you go home tonight and you can do this,

484
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,080
 Google, "How do I convert to?"

485
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,040
 Google's gonna auto-fill Hindu faith,

486
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,080
 Islam,

487
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,160
 Jehovah's Witness,

488
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,440
 any religion that's out there, right?

489
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,080
 The Jewish faith, Buddhism,

490
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,200
 and what you're going to see, friends,

491
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,120
 is strive, strive, strive,

492
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,480
 strive to achieve nirvana,

493
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,280
 strive to achieve enlightenment,

494
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,440
 strive to not want,

495
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,800
 strive to do enough good deeds

496
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,180
 so that you can come back as a person of nobility,

497
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,480
 strive to follow the law of the Old Testament,

498
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,860
 strive to comply with the five pillars of Islam,

499
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,800
 strive, strive, strive, strive.

500
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,240
 You work your way up to God for a chance to get in.

501
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,280
 You don't know if you're getting in or not.

502
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,080
 You do everything you can.

503
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,160
 You take a Hajj to Mecca.

504
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,000
 You pray several times a day.

505
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,800
 You do everything you can for a chance to get to God,

506
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,680
 and yet Christianity says that God loved you so much

507
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,320
 that he came here.

508
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,400
 Every other religion, you're working your way up.

509
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,280
 Christianity, God says, "I'm coming to you.

510
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,440
 "I'm gonna save you."

511
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,240
 And he came to the earth in the form of a man, Jesus Christ,

512
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,240
 2018 years ago in an event that reset the calendar,

513
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,600
 and you acknowledged it.

514
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,360
 Every atheist in the room acknowledges it

515
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,800
 by the date they put on their checks today

516
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,400
 or the date in their Microsoft Outlook.

517
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,640
 Right, and we know this because of this book

518
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,840
 that's been passed down, written over 1,500 years

519
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,500
 with one central message, 66 books, really,

520
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,240
 40 different authors, telling one story

521
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,120
 of God coming to save us.

522
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,720
 By the way, it's been the bestseller this year, last year,

523
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,260
 every single year, and the bestseller

524
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,400
 in the history of history, this book.

525
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,400
 The second place is a far distant margin, this book.

526
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,480
 That God, you research it, you look into it,

527
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,340
 you grow your confidence in it.

528
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:57,780
 God said he loved the world.

529
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,560
 Most famous verse in the scriptures, John 3, 16,

530
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,680
 "For God so loved the world,"

531
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,060
 the Greek word there is the cosmos.

532
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,780
 It's the universe and its inhabitants,

533
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,920
 is how it's translated.

534
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,360
 "For God so loved the cosmos

535
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,460
 "that he gave his only begotten son,

536
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:20,360
 "that whoever or whosoever or anyone who believes in him

537
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,960
 "shall not perish, not go to hell,

538
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,960
 "not die an eternal death, but have eternal life."

539
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,140
 That's what I want from you, is eternal life.

540
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:40,140
 I was at a birthday party a couple weeks ago here in Dallas.

541
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,220
 There's a restaurant called Javier's in uptown.

542
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,860
 We were there, we're sitting on the patio,

543
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,300
 some friends, lots of friends, actually big table.

544
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,120
 And one of the couples had to leave early.

545
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,180
 And so they were leaving.

546
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,460
 And so what he did was he just left a wad of cash

547
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,500
 on the table and he said, "Hey, I got everyone."

548
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,620
 He said, "I'll pay for everyone."

549
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,940
 Which I was like, that's kind, okay.

550
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,180
 I'm not going to argue with you.

551
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,900
 And so then he leaves, right?

552
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,400
 And he texts and says, "Hey, I left money there.

553
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,980
 "Everyone's covered."

554
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,440
 And so the money's there on the table.

555
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,860
 The guy starts bringing the checks

556
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,380
 and you're faced with the decision,

557
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,820
 is my meal paid for or not?

558
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,180
 There's enough, more than enough money to cover you.

559
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,140
 And this is the same predicament,

560
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,660
 the same dilemma that you face with Jesus.

561
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:33,660
 Jesus died to pay for your sins and you get a choice.

562
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,260
 Do I accept his payment or do I reject his payment?

563
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,260
 Do I say, "Hey, that was for me, for my sins,

564
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,580
 "past, present and future, everything that I've done wrong."

565
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:49,180
 Or do I reject it and leave it on the table?

566
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:55,080
 And say, "No, I choose to willingly suffer for my own sins."

567
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,000
 Christ's payment was enough.

568
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,700
 And see, what I want you to see here

569
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,060
 is that Christianity is not about what you do,

570
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,740
 but rather what Jesus did.

571
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:12,740
 And the way that Jesus paid invites us all to be saved.

572
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,480
 The way that Jesus paid invites us all to be saved.

573
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,060
 And so what about the one who's never heard?

574
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,460
 The infamous Bushmen in Africa.

575
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,360
 Man, this used to be a big hangup for me.

576
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,100
 Like I really struggle with this 'cause I'm like,

577
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,660
 "Man, it just doesn't seem fair.

578
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,940
 "There's people out there that's never,

579
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,900
 "they've never heard the gospel."

580
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,800
 This was a big stumbling block for me.

581
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,640
 Until I went to Africa.

582
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,820
 And I went to the Masai Mara,

583
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,420
 literally the African jungle, that's where I'm at.

584
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,220
 I mean, here's a picture of when I was there.

585
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,540
 And those people are not in uniform.

586
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,220
 Like that's where they live.

587
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,060
 That's who they are.

588
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,260
 They live out there in the African bush.

589
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,040
 And I'm out there with them.

590
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,220
 And this lady sees me from across the way,

591
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,100
 has this big, beautiful smile.

592
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,100
 And she comes up to me and she says,

593
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,340
 in the broken English, she says,

594
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,180
 "Can I ask you a question?"

595
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,140
 I said, "Yeah, ask me anything."

596
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,980
 She says, "Are you saved?"

597
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,580
 And I said, "Well, what do you mean by saved?"

598
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,140
 'Cause I'm thinking she doesn't mean what I think

599
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,260
 when somebody says, "Are you saved?"

600
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,740
 I'm like, "Am I saved from lions or what?

601
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,940
 "I don't know."

602
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,940
 (congregation laughing)

603
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,620
 And she says, "Are you saved?

604
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,660
 "Are you a Christian?"

605
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,220
 And I said, "Yes, I am a Christian."

606
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,420
 And she said, "Oh, me too, I'm a Christian too."

607
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,100
 I said, "How did you become a Christian out here?"

608
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,720
 And she said, "Well, I've always believed in God.

609
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,860
 "And God has always spoken to me in my dreams.

610
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,660
 "And one day he told me in my dream,

611
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,340
 "this is my son, Jesus Christ.

612
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,460
 "He has died for your sins.

613
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,860
 "And he has risen from the grave

614
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,300
 "so that you can be with me forever."

615
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,060
 And I looked her in the eyes and I didn't flinch.

616
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,180
 I said, "Oh, I understand a missionary came here

617
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,880
 "and shared the gospel with you.

618
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,820
 "And then you had a dream about it."

619
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,780
 And she looked at me like I was crazy.

620
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,780
 And she said, "No missionary came here."

621
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,980
 And I said, "Well, how did you know his name was Jesus?"

622
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,020
 And she said, "That was his name in my dream."

623
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,300
 (congregation laughing)

624
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,380
 And I said, "I'm done, worried about the Bushmen in Africa."

625
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,220
 Can I tell you something?

626
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,100
 I've been in ministry 12 years.

627
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,740
 I've heard the same story from Iran.

628
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,380
 I was on the phone once or on a show once

629
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,220
 and a 12 year old girl called in

630
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,780
 and I was sharing my testimony.

631
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,100
 And she called him from Iran and said,

632
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,820
 "That guy that he's talking about,

633
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,060
 "I dreamt about him last night.

634
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:40,100
 "What do I need to do to accept him as my Lord and Savior?"

635
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,880
 And I've read an entire book from an author I trust,

636
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,500
 all about people coming to the faith

637
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,780
 through dreams and visions.

638
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,380
 So to the person who says,

639
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,460
 "What about the one who's never heard?"

640
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,140
 They're just trying to get a pass for themselves, right?

641
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,700
 Hashtag, I'm asking for a friend.

642
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,540
 What about the one who's never heard?

643
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,780
 And what about you?

644
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,620
 What about the one who's never heard?

645
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,500
 Go tell them.

646
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,540
 Go tell them, spend your life telling them,

647
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,460
 finding them and telling them,

648
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,020
 sharing the truth of eternal life with them

649
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,020
 through Jesus Christ.

650
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,040
 Why wouldn't you tell them?

651
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,380
 And you say, "Well, how do I know?

652
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,720
 "Like, can I know that I'm going to heaven?

653
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,980
 "How do I know that I'm going?"

654
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,500
 How do you know anything?

655
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,140
 What do you trust in?

656
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,500
 How do you gain information?

657
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,340
 What do you look at?

658
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,380
 Where do you find your facts?

659
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,840
 Jesus says, "Do not let your hearts be troubled.

660
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,240
 "You believe in God, you believe in God,

661
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,080
 "so also believe in me.

662
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,280
 "I go and prepare a place for you.

663
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,180
 "I will come back and take you to be with me,

664
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,220
 "that you also may be where I am.

665
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,180
 "You know the way to the place where I am going.

666
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,580
 "I'm telling you, I'm telling you the way."

667
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,820
 My third and final point is that Christianity is certain.

668
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,020
 You can be sure.

669
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,820
 You can be sure.

670
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,180
 If you've been here long at all,

671
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,780
 you know that I like to share the gospel

672
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,060
 by asking two questions called the Kennedy questions.

673
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,780
 And this first question I want to ask to you,

674
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,260
 between one and 10, 10 being certain,

675
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,100
 one being not so sure,

676
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,660
 if you were to die today,

677
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,340
 how certain are you that you would go to heaven?

678
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,100
 10 is certain, one's not so sure.

679
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,960
 If you died today,

680
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,700
 how certain are you that you would go to heaven?

681
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,540
 If you're taking notes,

682
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,540
 go ahead and write down your number.

683
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,180
 If you have your phone, why don't you punch it in there?

684
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,020
 I'd love for you to identify your number.

685
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,140
 How certain are you?

686
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,020
 You think, you don't have to share it with anyone.

687
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,500
 Just right now, how certain are you

688
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,900
 that you would go to heaven?

689
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
 (pause)

690
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,480
 Okay, I'm going to ask you to do something, okay?

691
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,340
 What I'd love for you to do,

692
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,620
 I'd love for everyone to close their eyes.

693
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,180
 Now I'm up here, I'm watching your purse,

694
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,780
 you know, it's okay.

695
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,860
 If you would close your eyes for just a minute,

696
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,700
 for just a minute.

697
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,460
 Now I'm going to ask you to raise your hand.

698
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,540
 If you were one to five, would you raise your hand?

699
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,780
 If you were one to five, okay,

700
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,580
 I see several hands, lots of hands.

701
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,900
 One to five, raise your hand.

702
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,740
 I'm looking around.

703
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,700
 Okay, several of you are one to five.

704
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,700
 All right, okay, if you were six or seven,

705
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,620
 raise your hand.

706
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,260
 Okay, lots of sixes and sevens.

707
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,420
 I see you, I see you, lots of, okay.

708
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,280
 All right, thank you.

709
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,100
 If you were eight or nine, raise your hand.

710
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,940
 Wow, okay, a lot, lots of eights and nines.

711
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,020
 Okay, upstairs, okay, I see you, eights and nines.

712
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,940
 All right, you can come back with me now.

713
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,940
 Thank you for that.

714
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,340
 For humoring me with that.

715
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,660
 I'm going to come back to that in just a minute.

716
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,740
 I know I said that the vast majority of world religions,

717
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,940
 they teach a striving, a working your way up to God,

718
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,020
 but also an uncertainty.

719
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,620
 That after all of your striving,

720
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,840
 you're left with a question mark.

721
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,220
 You don't really know if you got in or not until you die.

722
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:08,220
 And this fear allows religious leaders to rule you.

723
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,780
 'Cause I can say, well, I don't know if you've done enough.

724
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,540
 Maybe you need to give more to the church.

725
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,660
 Maybe you need to do a little bit more.

726
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,340
 Maybe you need to be nicer to me.

727
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,020
 And this is what happens within cults.

728
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,460
 You see cult leaders do this

729
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,860
 and use this fear against people.

730
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,740
 And so Christianity is the only religion,

731
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,360
 certainly the only world religion that I know of

732
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,860
 that offers assurance of salvation.

733
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,380
 It says that you can know.

734
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,820
 It's in 1 John chapter five, 11 through 13.

735
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,740
 It says, and this is God's testimony.

736
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,020
 Okay, so this is the story of God.

737
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,020
 He shares here in 1 John.

738
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,220
 Here's the story of God.

739
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,780
 God has given us eternal life.

740
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,060
 Where, how, how do I get?

741
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,540
 And this life is in his son.

742
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,400
 Whoever has the son has life.

743
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,620
 Whoever does not have the son of God does not have life.

744
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,180
 I write these things to you

745
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,180
 who believe in the name of the son of God

746
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:09,180
 so that you may know that you have eternal life.

747
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,340
 So I want you to look at that word, K-N-O-W,

748
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,740
 that word know there,

749
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,400
 that you can know that you have eternal life,

750
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,900
 that you can be certain.

751
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,400
 In Greek, this word translates

752
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,460
 to know as a fact as though to see it.

753
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,900
 That you can be a 10,

754
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,820
 that you don't have to leave here

755
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,820
 a coin toss away from hell.

756
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,220
 50% chance that I'm gonna go and burn in hell,

757
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,700
 suffer in hell forever.

758
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,560
 A 20% chance, a 10% chance is no way to live

759
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,780
 that you can leave here and be certain

760
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,020
 that you're going to be with God forever and ever

761
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,280
 and ever and ever and ever in his presence,

762
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,460
 in his kingdom forever.

763
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,140
 And that is worth celebrating.

764
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,100
 That brings joy to our hearts.

765
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,380
 That gives us a reason to live, a purpose to move forward.

766
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,740
 It allows us to see past our struggles.

767
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,340
 It allows us to lean into him.

768
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,300
 It allows us to seek him, right?

769
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,900
 It allows us to know him,

770
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,020
 that we would move toward God and study his word.

771
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,620
 It should bring a peace that transcends all understanding

772
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,820
 to guard our hearts and our minds in Christ Jesus.

773
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:22,020
 And without it, we're left with an uncertainty.

774
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,540
 I just don't know.

775
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,500
 That's no way to live tomorrow.

776
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,680
 I just don't know.

777
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,620
 My kids, man, they're always asking for stuff.

778
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,500
 Can we buy this?

779
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,340
 Can we go here?

780
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,180
 Can we do this?

781
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,540
 Can I get this?

782
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,620
 And I try to answer them straight all the time.

783
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,500
 And they learned what a RV is, okay?

784
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,700
 Like we're driving down the street.

785
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,620
 They're like, "Daddy, what's that?"

786
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,220
 I'm like, "Well, it's like a house on wheels."

787
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,740
 They're like, "Pfft, pfft, mind blown, you know?

788
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,580
 "House on wheels?

789
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,740
 "Daddy, we got to get one of those."

790
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,040
 I'm like, "Yeah, pray."

791
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,620
 And so they're like, "Daddy, Daddy, can we?"

792
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,620
 They schemed on me.

793
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,460
 That's what they do.

794
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,300
 They get together, they talk, and they come

795
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,660
 in a unified force.

796
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,700
 And it's hard to say no to these cute faces.

797
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,000
 They're like, "Daddy, okay, here's what we did.

798
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,500
 "We all picked a state, okay?

799
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,980
 "And we would like to drive there.

800
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,620
 "We'd like to get an RV.

801
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,400
 "So you buy an RV, Dad, that's your part.

802
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,640
 "You're gonna buy the RV, and then we're gonna drive.

803
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,900
 "We'll each go to our states,

804
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,700
 "and that will be our vacation.

805
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,820
 "Daddy, can we do it?"

806
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,820
 And I'm like, "I don't know, man.

807
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,940
 "I don't think so, probably not."

808
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,900
 And they're like, "So maybe?

809
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,940
 "You telling me there's a chance?"

810
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,180
 And they come at me every day.

811
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,940
 They're like, "Daddy, so I'm gonna go to Alabama,

812
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,980
 "and they're gonna go to Kentucky."

813
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,380
 And I'm like, "Why?

814
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,680
 (audience laughing)

815
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,500
 "Why would you do that?"

816
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,020
 And so they're scheming on me, right?

817
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,820
 And they're just left all summer with this uncertainty.

818
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:47,300
 They're excited about an idea,

819
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,400
 but they don't know if they can really celebrate.

820
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,040
 Now, that's very different if I look at them,

821
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,360
 and I say, "Hey, guys, listen.

822
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,860
 "I got the RV.

823
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,020
 "It's in the driveway, and we're gonna go tomorrow.

824
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,180
 "Like God willing, if he gives us tomorrow,

825
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,620
 "we're all jumping in that RV,

826
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,220
 "and we are going to Alabama and Kentucky."

827
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,500
 You know? (audience laughing)

828
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,220
 It's gonna happen, right?

829
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,680
 And that's a different celebration when they know that.

830
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,340
 It's a done deal.

831
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,580
 This is what Christ said to you.

832
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,660
 He looks at you from the cross

833
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,860
 with his arms stretched wide,

834
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,920
 and he says, "Come.

835
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,940
 "Come, I've prepared a place for you.

836
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,540
 "Would you come?

837
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:38,060
 "I've suffered and died for you

838
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,180
 "so that you don't have to suffer.

839
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,340
 "You can have eternal life.

840
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,400
 "I've defeated the grave for you.

841
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,260
 "Would you come?

842
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,020
 "It's as good as done, it is finished."

843
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,860
 Indeed.

844
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,560
 So you say, "Well, can I lose my salvation?"

845
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,800
 I don't know, what'd you do to get your salvation?

846
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,960
 You can't lose something

847
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,760
 that you didn't do anything to earn.

848
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,580
 If you didn't do anything to earn it,

849
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,040
 then how can it be taken away from you

850
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,620
 if it was given to you freely in spite of you,

851
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,840
 for it is by grace you have been saved through faith,

852
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,960
 and this is not of yourselves, it's a gift of God.

853
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,640
 Gift of God, gift of God,

854
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,160
 not by works, not by works, not by works,

855
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,900
 so that no one can boast, it's Ephesians 2, 8, 9.

856
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:33,160
 If you did nothing for it,

857
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,000
 then how could you lose it?

858
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,100
 What did you, what would you do to lose it?

859
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:43,920
 And so in summary, there is one way to heaven,

860
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,200
 and his name is Jesus.

861
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,100
 Everyone is invited,

862
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,680
 and you can be sure.

863
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,680
 If you wanted to know how to get to London,

864
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,920
 you could ask me, I was just there.

865
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,560
 The reason I know the way to London

866
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,040
 is because I was just there and I came back here.

867
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,200
 If you want to know how to get to heaven,

868
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,900
 find someone who's been there and came here,

869
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:21,240
 and look carefully at what they've said, right?

870
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,520
 If you trust me and you trust that I was there recently,

871
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,640
 and you trust my sanity,

872
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,400
 then you trust that I know how to get there.

873
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,960
 You better believe the Queen of England

874
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,700
 knows how to get to London.

875
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,900
 She lives there.

876
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,560
 You better believe the King of Heaven

877
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,620
 knows how to get to heaven.

878
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,620
 He lives there, he reigns there, he's king there,

879
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,880
 and everything you see and everything you know, he created.

880
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,440
 So if you're going to trust something,

881
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,840
 why not trust his word?

882
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,600
 There's some crazy language in this text.

883
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,000
 Some really strange language.

884
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,880
 I don't know if you've listened this whole way

885
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,480
 and you haven't questioned what it says.

886
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,060
 It says some crazy things.

887
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:12,400
 He says, "In my father's house, there are many rooms."

888
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,800
 Like if you're the disciples, you're listening to this,

889
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,560
 you're like, "Dude, okay, your dad's rich, I get it, man.

890
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,100
 "Why are we talking about your dad's crib right now?

891
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,200
 "Like what's going on?"

892
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,760
 He's like, "He's got a big house, lots of rooms."

893
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,520
 You're like, "I'm confused."

894
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,640
 He said, "I'm going there to prepare a room for you."

895
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,160
 I gotta show you something beautiful, okay?

896
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,160
 Like this always stirs my heart.

897
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,080
 Jesus here is using a really intimate language.

898
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:46,520
 It's the Jewish wedding language.

899
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,600
 You gotta hear me on this, okay?

900
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,440
 Stay with me.

901
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,840
 We see it so clearly in this text.

902
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,920
 What would happen is when a Hebrew boy,

903
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,100
 a young Jewish boy was of age and ready to go get married,

904
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,020
 what he would do is he would leave his land

905
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,560
 and go to a foreign land in search of a bride.

906
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,760
 He would leave his father's land

907
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,920
 and go to a foreign land in search of a bride,

908
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,080
 someone to take as his wife.

909
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,860
 And when he would find her, are you ready?

910
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,180
 When he would find her,

911
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,280
 he would pay what was called a dowry.

912
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,080
 He put down a down payment.

913
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,840
 It was a heavy sum to show that,

914
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,080
 "Hey, I mean business.

915
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,760
 I'm coming back for you."

916
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,120
 Because he'd have to leave.

917
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,040
 And the reason that he would leave,

918
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,280
 so he would go to her father and he'd pay this dowry,

919
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,040
 saying, "Hey, I'm purchasing the right

920
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,120
 to take your daughter as mine forever."

921
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,140
 And then he would leave

922
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,840
 and he'd go back to the land that he came from.

923
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,840
 And he would begin to build a room on his father's house

924
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,880
 that they would live in,

925
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,000
 because his father's house

926
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,280
 was one day gonna be his house.

927
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,000
 Inheritance was everything in this culture.

928
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,800
 And so he would begin to build this room for him

929
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,200
 and his new bride to live in forever.

930
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,680
 And at a time and an hour when no one knew,

931
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,400
 he would go back and he would return for her.

932
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,360
 People would run in front of him,

933
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,640
 his bridal party, if you would, his groomsmen,

934
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,280
 and they'd blast trumpets and they'd say, "He's coming."

935
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,320
 And the word would spread from town to town.

936
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,900
 It would go in front of him until it reached her.

937
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,560
 And she would hear, "Hey, your bride is coming,

938
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,880
 your groom is coming, your groom is coming for you."

939
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,180
 And she would quickly scramble

940
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,880
 and get her wedding dress and her bridal party.

941
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,560
 And he would come and he'd look at her and he'd say,

942
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,480
 "You are now mine forever.

943
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,420
 Come, let's go back to my land,

944
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,240
 back to my home,

945
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,320
 and back to this room."

946
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,240
 And so what Jesus is saying to you,

947
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:53,480
 he's saying, "Hey, I've paid for you.

948
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,340
 I've put down the dowry for you, my bride,

949
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:00,760
 so that I can take you home to be with me forever.

950
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,760
 Now, I've purchased you with my own blood,

951
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,440
 poured out for you to cover your sins.

952
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,200
 And now I'm going to go home to my father's house

953
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,680
 and prepare a place for you, for all of you,

954
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,320
 for anyone who would like to dwell there,

955
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,240
 for anyone who would like to accept the payment

956
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,140
 of the blood that he shed for your sins,

957
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,640
 that you can be with him forever and ever and ever

958
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,080
 and ever and ever and ever."

959
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,580
 (congregation applauding)

960
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:34,600
 I'm going to ask you to shut your eyes again, if you would.

961
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,440
 Thank you.

962
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,100
 Hundreds and hundreds of you,

963
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,840
 said, "I'm not sure.

964
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,720
 I'm not a 10."

965
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,900
 And if you're at a place right now

966
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,260
 where you would like to be a 10,

967
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,340
 to move from a five to a 10, a nine to a 10,

968
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,140
 a seven to a 10, would you raise your hand?

969
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,980
 Would you put it up so that I can see it?

970
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,500
 Okay, I see it, that's amazing.

971
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,800
 Praise God, praise God.

972
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,140
 That's incredible, that's incredible.

973
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,300
 Praise God for you.

974
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,920
 Wow, that is overwhelming, that's overwhelming.

975
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,420
 Okay, you guys can look at me.

976
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,500
 I'm not trying to be manipulative.

977
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,520
 I don't need anything from you,

978
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,880
 but we're going to sing a song.

979
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,220
 And my prayer, and you don't have to,

980
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,640
 but my prayer is that if you just raised your hand,

981
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,400
 and so many of you just did,

982
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,960
 that you'd have the courage to come up here.

983
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,520
 And I'd come back up after this song

984
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,200
 and I would pray over you.

985
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,080
 And dear, in this song, you just come forward,

986
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,440
 just come to the altar,

987
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,320
 come up here and know that he's prepared a place for you.

988
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,160
 Would you do that?

989
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,240
 Let me pray.

990
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,280
 Father, thank you so much for those that just said,

991
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,960
 "I want to be sure, I know, I know what Christ did for me.

992
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,280
 "I know what he paid for me."

993
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,280
 Lord, would you stir in them the courage to tell somebody

994
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,520
 about the power of your Holy Spirit?

995
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,000
 Would you work into their hearts,

996
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,440
 surround them with men and women who love them and know you

997
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,040
 and who know them and love you?

998
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:29,200
 Father, thank you for the gift of salvation

999
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,600
 that comes to us by way of your Son, Jesus Christ,

1000
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,880
 and your Holy Spirit who seals us and preserves us

1001
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,520
 and carries us home so that the enemy can't snatch us away.

1002
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,560
 Father, we sing to you now, we worship you now.

1003
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,880
 In Jesus' name, amen.
