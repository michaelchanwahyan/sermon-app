[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.360]   - Well, what's up Porch, how we doing tonight?
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.840]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600]   Hey, my name is Timothy Atik,
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.440]   and I am a teaching pastor here
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.120]   at Watermark Community Church,
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.760]   and I am so honored that I get to jump in
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.680]   and spend time with you guys tonight here at the porch.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.280]   I firmly believe that there is nothing better
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.960]   that you could be doing on a Tuesday night
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.360]   than being right here with friends worshiping Jesus.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.360]   So welcome, I'm so glad that you made it,
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.440]   and I'm glad we get some time together tonight.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.280]   Here's what I wanna ask you to do right now.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.920]   I wanna ask you to pull out your phone,
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.920]   and I wanna ask you to text a response to a number,
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.840]   and I'm gonna see your response in real time up here.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.600]   So this could go terribly wrong.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.480]   I'm just gonna acknowledge that from the beginning.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.960]   This could be the first and last time I ever do this,
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.280]   but it's worth the risk, we'll see what happens.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.400]   I just want to know, in your opinion,
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.080]   who is the GOAT?
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.880]   The greatest of all time.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.880]   I'm not gonna put any parameters on it.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.000]   I'm not gonna tell you that we're talking about a sport,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   or we're talking about an actor or act, no, we're not.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   In your opinion, who is the GOAT?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Text 972-497-1185, text your answer in,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.720]   and I will see what your answers are.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.000]   You can share your answer with your neighbor, too.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.280]   All right, who you say is the GOAT?
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.200]   So I'll just read some of the responses that are coming in.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.800]   I most certainly will not be able to share
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.800]   what you're saying, but I will read some of the responses.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.120]   I'm gonna read the first one.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.160]   The first responses that are coming in,
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.880]   I most certainly will not be able to share
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.840]   every response that has come in,
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.720]   but I'll just share some of them.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.720]   Simone Biles, Michael Jordan, LeBron James,
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.800]   interesting how that works.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.360]   Elon Musk.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.760]   My grandma, okay, that's great, good for you.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.320]   Bieber.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.680]   Tom Brady.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.520]   Dirk.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:52.320]   Phil Wickham, okay, that's great, nice.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.360]   Go with the Christian answer, way to go there.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.360]   Michael Scott, that's valid.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.360]   Another LeBron, another Jordan, a lot of Tom Brady.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.360]   Patrick Mahomes.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.120]   Anyway, Taylor Swift, of course, I was waiting for it.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.280]   There she is.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.120]   Tiger Woods made the list.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.960]   Messi made the list.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.240]   Okay, interesting.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.760]   Anyone else that is worth mentioning?
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.440]   Aaron Rodgers, okay, interesting.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.420]   Here in Dallas, okay.
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.640]   Nick Saban, another Michael Jordan.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.280]   Lots of Jordans.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.280]   Taylor Swift in there again.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.280]   Okay, so that's who you might say is the GOAT.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.640]   If you feel like you got left out
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.640]   because your response wasn't read,
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.400]   you can just take a minute, share with your neighbor,
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.280]   say, he didn't read my response,
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.880]   but the real GOAT is, just tell 'em real quick,
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.720]   just share it.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.000]   Okay, great, good.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.120]   Everyone feel like you got it out of your system?
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.840]   You have had the chance to share
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.780]   who you believe is the GOAT, great, awesome.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.280]   Well, the reason that I even start that way
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.040]   is here's the deal.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.200]   I don't know if you know this,
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.280]   but Jesus Christ actually chimes in
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.040]   on the conversation about the GOAT.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.040]   I don't know if you know that,
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.680]   but in the Bible, Jesus Christ actually weighs in
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.520]   on the conversation.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.280]   Before we have even had the conversation
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.600]   about who the GOAT is,
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.720]   Jesus actually started the conversation
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.400]   and declared who he believed the GOAT actually was.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.920]   Here's what he says in Matthew chapter 11, verse 11.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.200]   Jesus says, "Truly I say to you,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.200]   among those born of women," that's everyone,
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.280]   "there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist."
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.560]   Did you know Jesus said that?
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.120]   So if you grew up in the church
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.820]   and you get asked who's the GOAT,
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.360]   you know that the right answer to every question
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.260]   when you're inside the church walls is what?
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.320]   Jesus, okay.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.360]   So we would, it's important that we acknowledge
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.440]   that we believe here at Watermark Community Church
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.120]   that Jesus actually is the GOAT,
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.680]   that he is the greatest of all time.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.920]   But it's interesting to think that the person
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.560]   that we believe is the GOAT actually chimed in
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.360]   and said, "In my opinion, the greatest of all time,
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.240]   the greatest to ever be born of a woman,
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.480]   which is everyone, in Jesus's opinion,
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.360]   is a guy named John the Baptist."
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.960]   And I just find that interesting,
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.440]   and I find that worthy of examination.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.040]   Because if Jesus, the person that we might look at
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.200]   and say, "He's the GOAT," if he's pointing at someone
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.300]   saying, "You know what, he is the GOAT,"
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.720]   then I just think that that's important
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.920]   because here we have Jesus saying,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.240]   "This is what a truly great life looks like."
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.400]   And so for us to look at someone that Jesus would say
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.320]   is living or lived a truly great life,
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.880]   that is something that is worthy
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.320]   of exploration and examination.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.240]   And the reason that I think it's so important for us
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.160]   in a room full of young adults to do that
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.600]   is because I believe that every single person here
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.320]   is pursuing greatness.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.220]   Like, nobody here is aspiring to mediocrity.
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.640]   Like, nobody here, if I was like scale of one to 10,
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.760]   like, where do you hope to land
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.840]   in terms of enjoyment of life?
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.520]   No one's like, "I'll take a four."
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.800]   No, like, no one wants to settle for mediocrity.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.040]   No one is like, "You know what, TA,"
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.560]   that's what people call me, "TA, you know what?
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.880]   "My goal was to go to a mediocre college
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.840]   "and make mediocre grades and graduate
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.440]   "with a mediocre degree, and I searched
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.220]   "and found a mediocre job, and now I'm looking
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.820]   "for a mediocre spouse, and hopefully one day
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.120]   "we're gonna have a mediocre marriage
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.360]   "and a mediocre house and definitely some mediocre kids,
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.360]   "and I wanna grow old and be a mediocre grandparent
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.440]   "and have a mediocre funeral."
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.040]   Nobody aspires to mediocrity.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.800]   Everybody wants greatness in some way.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.160]   And so the question is, what does it look like
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.120]   to be great in the eyes of Jesus?
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.060]   Because what a shame it would be to be great
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.600]   in the eyes of man, but not great in the eyes of Jesus.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.760]   When there is somebody in the scriptures
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.540]   that Jesus looks at and says, "Hey, if you wanna know
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.840]   "what a great life looks like, there it is,
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.500]   "John the Baptist."
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.560]   And so what I wanna do is I just wanna spend some time
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.840]   talking tonight about what true greatness looks like
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.320]   so that you don't spin your wheels carelessly
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.580]   and get to the end of your life and look back
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.080]   and say, "What I thought was great truly wasn't."
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.800]   Okay?
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.040]   So if you have a Bible, I want you to join me tonight
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.760]   in John chapter one.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.640]   John, the book of John, if you're new to the Bible,
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.240]   it's in the second half of your Bible.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.800]   Don't be afraid to use the table of contents,
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.600]   but it's in what's called the New Testament.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.600]   The New Testament starts with four books
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.120]   that are known as the Gospels.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.600]   There's Matthew, Mark, Luke, and then John.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.120]   We are looking at the very first chapter of John.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.720]   There's many different Johns in the Bible.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.240]   We are talking specifically about a guy
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.000]   named John the Baptist.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.360]   John the Baptist was a medical marvel
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.740]   because he was born to a set of parents
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.040]   that were way too old to have a child.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.960]   Like his parents were old, wrinkly, and barren,
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.960]   and yet miraculously, at a really old age,
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.760]   his mom gets pregnant.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.200]   And so he was a medical marvel
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.360]   and he was relatives with Jesus.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.280]   And what you need to know about John the Baptist
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.800]   is he was super hipster.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.440]   Like he lived outside of town
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.000]   doing the #vanlife thing.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.560]   He had watched some documentaries,
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.140]   so he didn't eat meat.
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:58.140]   He ate bugs and honey for his diet.
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.740]   If you don't think he was hipster,
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.120]   his clothes were made of camel's hair
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.920]   with a leather belt around his waist.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.920]   Just wait, I promise you, camel hair,
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.800]   if it's not in now, wait a year.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.480]   And just reference this talk and say,
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.720]   he called it, he was right.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.720]   Camel hair, leather belt, just watch, it's coming.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.880]   He took a vow to not cut his hair.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.000]   He always said what he was thinking.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.140]   His life ended when he got arrested
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.060]   and was beheaded for calling out the Roman ruler
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.380]   for taking his brother's wife to be his wife.
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.560]   So that's who we're talking about, John the Baptist.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.420]   And what you're going to see
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.900]   as we look at John the Baptist
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.780]   is we're going to see a life
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.780]   that Jesus considered to be great.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.580]   And what I hope is clear to you tonight is this,
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.960]   don't miss it, all eyes on me.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.960]   The greatest lives are marked by the greatest clarity.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:58.060]   Okay, the greatest lives are marked by the greatest clarity.
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.300]   The greatest lives are marked by the greatest clarity.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.300]   What do I mean by that?
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.740]   Well, I mean this, the greatest lives
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.120]   have the greatest clarity when it comes to three things.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.620]   So I hope that you don't miss them tonight.
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.660]   Here's the first one.
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.780]   First, greatness requires clarity
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.760]   on who you are and who you aren't.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.900]   That's where greatness has to start.
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.460]   Greatness has to start with you having clarity
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.300]   on who you are and who you aren't.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.480]   Like if you were someone
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.020]   who is still trying to find themselves
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.140]   or discover yourself,
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.140]   right now you're not living in greatness
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.220]   because greatness requires clarity
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.260]   on who you are and who you aren't.
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.660]   So look with me at John chapter one
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.180]   and I'll show you what I'm talking about.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.200]   It says this starting in verse 19.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.420]   It says, and this is the testimony of John.
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:55.540]   When the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.340]   to ask him, who are you?
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:03.220]   He confessed and did not deny, but confessed,
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.100]   I'm not the Christ.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:04.920]   Do you see it?
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.080]   He has clarity, I'm not the Christ.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.120]   And they asked him, what then?
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:08.960]   Are you Elijah?
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.300]   He said, I'm not.
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.140]   Are you the prophet?
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.440]   He answered, no.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.900]   So they said to him, who are you?
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.720]   We need to give an answer to those who sent us.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.360]   What do you say about yourself?
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.820]   He said, I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness.
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.040]   Make straight the way of the Lord
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.400]   as the prophet Isaiah said.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.000]   So all eyes on me.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.440]   Let me just make sure you understand
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.560]   what is happening right now in the first century.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.120]   That's where John the Baptist shows up.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.580]   In the first century, it was this time
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.580]   where there was this growing anticipation
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.560]   and excitement about a coming Messiah.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.280]   At this time, the Jewish people
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.520]   were under Roman oppression.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.840]   And so the Jews believed that there would be a Messiah,
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.840]   a savior that would come
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:00.480]   and would come as a ruling and conquering king
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.760]   who would establish political dominion
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.280]   and would overthrow oppressive Rome
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.900]   and establish a kingdom
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.300]   where Israel is the ruling kingdom.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.420]   And so that's what the Jews believed.
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.260]   And so John the Baptist shows up
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.860]   and Jews at the time,
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.820]   they're on the lookout for anyone suspicious
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:27.780]   that they might see is the Messiah.
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.260]   And John the Baptist shows up wearing camels hair
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.700]   and a leather belt, and he's not eating meat.
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.220]   He's eating honey and bugs.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.200]   And he's living outside of town
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.160]   and he's baptizing people.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.600]   Now, when you hear that, you might think,
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.640]   well, what's the big deal?
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.840]   Christians baptized.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.560]   Well, just remember,
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.680]   like Jesus has not come and died on the cross yet
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.000]   and risen from the dead.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.920]   When we baptize people now in the church,
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.640]   we do it for people to identify themselves
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.960]   with Jesus's death, burial and resurrection.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.880]   So when we hear that John the Baptist is baptizing,
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.960]   that's not what is happening here.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.960]   Baptism at this point in time was a way for Gentiles,
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.440]   people who weren't Jews,
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.960]   it was a purification ritual.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.600]   They would immerse themselves in water
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.120]   as a symbol that they were cleansing themselves
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.840]   as they enter the Jewish community.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.920]   And this was a ritual that was normally performed
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.160]   by a priest in an important place.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.240]   Well, John the Baptist shows up
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.240]   and instead of him watching people immerse themselves,
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.840]   he's dunking them.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.000]   And he's doing it outside of town in a river.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.680]   And he's not baptizing Gentiles,
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.360]   he's actually baptizing Jews.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.120]   So it's like John the Baptist is going to the people of God
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.280]   and saying, you think that you're God's people,
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.280]   but you're really not, you need to repent
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.620]   and I need to baptize you.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.260]   And so people see that and they're like, okay.
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.920]   Like the equivalent of the Jewish Supreme Court
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.760]   gets together and they're like,
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.000]   "We gotta figure out who this guy is."
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   So they send their minions and they go to John the Baptist
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.120]   and that sets up what we just read.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.360]   So they come to him
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.120]   and they just begin to work down their checklist.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.520]   So they start and they're like, "Hey, are you the Christ?"
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.680]   He's like, "Nope, wrong guy."
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.440]   Okay, Christ, it's the Greek word Christos,
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.880]   it corresponds with the Hebrew word Mashiach,
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.920]   which means Messiah or anointed one.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.040]   So they're like, "Are you the one?
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.800]   Are you the one that we've been waiting for?
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.080]   We've been anticipating
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.480]   and you're gonna deliver us from room."
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.820]   He's like, "Nope, you got the wrong guy."
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.880]   So they move down their list.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.880]   Okay, well then you gotta be Elijah.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.700]   Elijah was an important figure in the Old Testament.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.240]   And people believed that,
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.560]   you know, Elijah didn't die in the Old Testament,
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.320]   he was just carried off by a fiery chariot.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.400]   And if you're new to the church, you're like,
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.240]   "That sounds like a pretty great way to go.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.400]   Like, how do you sign up for that?"
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.000]   But in the last book of the Old Testament,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.120]   it says that Elijah would come back.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.960]   So they're like, "Okay, so are you Elijah?"
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.920]   He's like, "Nope, not him either."
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.320]   They're like, "Okay, cross that name off the list.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.360]   Okay, then you have to be the prophet.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.600]   Okay, because Moses all the way back,
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.280]   at the beginning of the Old Testament,
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.760]   he promised that a prophet would come.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.000]   And we now know that that's a reference to Jesus,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.360]   but people had begun to believe
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.240]   that it was a special end times figure
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.480]   separate from the Messiah.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.000]   They're like, "Okay, then you have to be the prophet."
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.680]   And John's like, "I'm not him either."
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.520]   Do you see it?
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.720]   John has clarity on who he is and who he isn't.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.880]   He is, he's confident and clear.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.600]   And after they work through their list,
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.240]   they're like, "Okay, well then you just have
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.840]   to tell us who you are."
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.040]   And I love what he says.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.760]   Look back at what he says when they finally ask him.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.840]   Verse 22, they said, "Who are you?
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.800]   We need to give an answer to those who sent us.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.200]   What do you say about yourself?"
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.040]   What did he say?
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.560]   He says, "I'm the voice.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.480]   I'm the voice of one crying out."
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.040]   So you think about a voice,
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.720]   a voice isn't something that you can see.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.360]   It's only something that you can hear.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.120]   So this is amazing because John the Baptist is so clear
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.320]   on who he is and who he isn't.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.280]   He's saying, "Look, I'm not someone for you to look at
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.440]   or behold or be impressed by.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.600]   I am someone that you should hear.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.480]   And when you hear me, you should hear me pointing you
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.360]   to the one that you should actually fix your eyes
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.680]   and your hope on.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.440]   I'm just the voice of one crying out in the wilderness.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.360]   Make straight the way of the Lord."
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.400]   As the prophet Isaiah said,
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.240]   when kings would come to town,
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.040]   their route would be planned out
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.400]   and people would go before them
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.920]   and would clear out any debris that would get in the way
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.280]   of the king arriving on time.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.960]   And John the Baptist just saying, "Yeah, that's me.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.080]   I'm not the king.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:17.040]   I've just come to prepare the way for the king."
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.920]   He's clear on who he is and who he isn't.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.200]   I wanna go back to what he initially said
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.240]   because that's the most fascinating part for me.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:32.080]   Verse 20, it says, "He confessed
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.040]   and did not deny but confessed.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:40.200]   I am not the Christ."
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.160]   Talk about clarity.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.280]   He says, "I am not, I'm not the Christ."
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.280]   So just think what was John saying
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.120]   when he declares he's not the Christ.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.720]   There's so much packed into that.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.320]   He's declaring, "I'm not God.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.000]   I'm not the one who can rescue you.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.880]   I'm not your long awaited king.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.680]   I'm not the one that all of history has been pointing to.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.800]   I'm not the one that you have been hoping for,
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.280]   waiting for, praying for.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.360]   I don't deserve any of your worship.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.960]   I can't change your life.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.040]   I am just a man."
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.880]   That's what he's declaring when he declares,
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.080]   "I'm not the Christ."
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.200]   That phrase has become really meaningful to me.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.320]   Like when I was preparing for this message,
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.440]   I just found myself telling myself that,
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.320]   "You know what? I'm not the Christ."
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.920]   "You know what, T.A.? You are not the Christ."
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.480]   And it was very freeing to just tell myself that
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.360]   because as I just reminded myself,
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.320]   "Look, I'm not the Christ.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.680]   I can't change anyone's life.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.720]   I'm just a guy."
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.160]   I got clarity on who I was and who I wasn't.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.240]   And as a teaching pastor here at Watermark,
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.560]   this is what I do on a weekly basis.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.240]   So I want you to think about what I do.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.360]   I stand on a stage with spotlights on me in a microphone
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.360]   in front of a crowd of a few thousand people.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.920]   Where else is that happening in our city and in our world?
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:07.120]   Any other time that situation is happening,
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.440]   it's at a concert or at some event
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:15.440]   where the person on stage is there to win fame and applause.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.040]   And so if I'm not careful,
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:26.120]   I will make this moment all about me.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:31.480]   And as I just meditated on the idea that I'm not the Christ,
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.320]   God brought clarity to who I am as someone
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.520]   who stands up here and teaches the Bible.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.040]   I realized that all I am is a spiritual mailman.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:42.880]   That's what I am.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.080]   Like I'm a spiritual mailman.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.400]   God has written a letter.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.880]   This is called the Word of God.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.160]   And he has written it to you and to me.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.600]   And he's given me the responsibility of taking his letter
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.760]   and simply delivering it to you.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.520]   But if I'm not careful,
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.840]   I will begin to care what you think
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.040]   about how I deliver God's mail.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.360]   So I can begin to wonder, you know what?
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.800]   Are you gonna post about how I delivered God's mail?
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.040]   Like, did you think that I handed you the letter
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.520]   in a really like cool and attractive and funny way?
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.720]   But here's the thing.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:26.720]   Like, when's the last time you got nervous
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:33.000]   or impressed by your regular mailman?
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.400]   Like, when was the last time that you're like,
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.680]   oh my gosh, it's 12.08, he's coming, all right?
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.360]   And so like, you're like looking out the window
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.640]   and you see the truck and you're like, okay, all right,
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.960]   this is it, he's coming.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.440]   And like, when the mailman comes up,
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.480]   like you open the door real fast and you're like, hi.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:00.800]   I really like how you deliver my mail.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.120]   You changed my life.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.480]   Can we take a picture?
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.280]   Like, when's the last time you took a selfie
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.560]   with your mailman where you're like,
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.040]   oh my gosh, mailman, check it.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.240]   Like, when's the last time?
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.960]   That's not a thing.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:22.520]   But if I'm not careful, I'm gonna begin to care
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:27.520]   what you think about how I deliver God's mail.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.680]   And so it's just good for me to remember,
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.960]   hey, I'm not the Christ.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.000]   Like, I can't change your life,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.360]   but the Word of God combined with the Spirit of God
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.840]   absolutely can.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.720]   And so, you know what?
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.200]   The majority of people in the room
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.280]   will never be in the scenario that I'm in
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.040]   in terms of this, but I just wonder what it looks like
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.800]   for you to just realize, gain clarity on who you are
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.640]   and who you aren't.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.200]   Like, can we just all say at the same time
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.200]   that we're not the Christ?
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.120]   Would you be willing to declare that real quick?
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:00.960]   Just try it.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.640]   Just say it, I'm not the Christ.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.480]   Say it again.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.600]   Isn't that freeing?
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.360]   Is there anything freeing about that?
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.800]   Because here's the thing.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.600]   Some of you guys are living like you are the Christ.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.400]   You would never say that, but you are like Spider-Man
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.840]   trying to hold the bridge together for your friends.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.280]   Like, your friend right now who is struggling or depressed,
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.040]   you feel like it is on you
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.640]   to keep all of their life together.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.560]   Or your parents are going through a divorce,
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.520]   or things are falling apart at work,
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.280]   and you feel like it is all on you and on your shoulders
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.960]   to hold your life and everyone else's life together.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.920]   But here's the reality, you're not the Christ.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.360]   You're not.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.720]   That doesn't mean that you do nothing.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.280]   It just means you do what you can.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.760]   You do something, but you can't do everything.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.800]   Or you know what?
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.800]   Like, you look on social media,
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.520]   and then you drown in insecurity
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.240]   because you constantly feel like you're failing
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.560]   because social media tells you
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.400]   that you're supposed to be a Christ.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:14.920]   Like, you're supposed to just always be amazing.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.080]   You need to look amazing.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.080]   You need to have an amazing figure.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.040]   You need to be a perfect friend.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.640]   You need to work 80 hours a week,
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.280]   but then you need to still at the same time
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.520]   always have time for amazing experiences
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.960]   with amazing friends, having amazing drinks
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.680]   at amazing places, and you need to take amazing pictures,
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.960]   and then you need to do amazing work at church,
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.640]   and everything has to be amazing.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.760]   And the reality is you can't always
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.960]   and everything be amazing,
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.520]   'cause you're not the Christ.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.120]   And so what if you just,
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.960]   could you just allow the freedom
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.040]   to come of taking that weight off of your shoulders
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.640]   and putting it back on Jesus?
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.400]   Because His shoulders are strong enough to carry it.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.360]   And so I tell you that just to say,
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:17.120]   like, are you clear?
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.160]   Because greatness requires clarity
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.680]   on who you are and who you aren't, okay?
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.080]   Second, greatness requires clarity
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.640]   on who Jesus is and who He isn't.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.480]   The greatest lives have the greatest clarity.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.920]   Greatness requires clarity on who Jesus is and who He isn't.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.240]   Look back at the text, John chapter one.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.040]   Look at what it says in verse 24.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:45.000]   It says, "Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.560]   "They asked Him, 'Then why are you baptizing?
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.960]   "'If you're neither the Christ nor Elijah nor the prophet,
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:55.800]   "'John answered them, 'I baptize with water,
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.000]   "'but among you stands one you do not know,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.680]   "'even he who comes after me.'"
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.360]   That's important.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.120]   "Even he who comes after me,
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:11.120]   "the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie."
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.360]   These things took place in Bethany,
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.440]   across the Jordan where John was baptizing.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.440]   Did you see what he said?
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.320]   He says, "There's one that comes after me."
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.560]   The reason that that statement is important
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.480]   was because in the first century,
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.880]   there was a superficial belief
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.520]   that if you were older than someone,
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.120]   then you were more worthy of honor.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.920]   But John was technically older than Jesus.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.280]   And John's point is, "Jesus might've showed up after me,
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.520]   "but make no mistake, I'm not even worthy
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.680]   "to perform the task that was reserved for a slave.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.240]   "I'm not even worthy of that."
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:51.240]   See, Jesus's identity bred humility in John the Baptist.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.680]   See, when you realize who Jesus is,
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.560]   it reminds you who you're not.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.560]   And Jesus's identity breeds humility in you and in me.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.360]   Do you have that type of clarity on who he is?
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:13.240]   John's saying, "He came after me, but he ranks before me."
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:17.040]   Colossians 1, verse 18, it says this about Jesus.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.760]   It says, "He's the head of the body, the church.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:24.040]   "He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead."
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.640]   Watch this, "That in everything, he might be preeminent."
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.240]   Do you know what that word preeminent means?
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.800]   It means first place.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.680]   It means that Jesus Christ takes first place.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.880]   Sometimes we wanna act like Jesus is significant,
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.040]   but not preeminent.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.160]   He's significant.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.000]   You know what?
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.320]   He's a part of my life.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.360]   Like I've got a lot going on in my life right now,
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.640]   but he's still significant enough for me
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.760]   to carve out time on a Tuesday night
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.000]   for me to show up to the porch.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.200]   No, Jesus isn't just significant, he's preeminent.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.360]   First place.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:07.440]   So that's clarity on who he is and who he isn't.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.760]   John goes on in verse 29, he says,
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.760]   it says, "The next day, he, John the Baptist,
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.640]   "saw Jesus coming toward him and said,
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.600]   "'Behold, the Lamb of God,
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.520]   "'who takes away the sin of the world.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.840]   "'This is he of whom I said,
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.000]   "'after me comes a man who ranks before me,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.560]   "'because he was before me.'"
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.600]   John the Baptist says, "You wanna know who Jesus is?
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.240]   "He's the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world."
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.720]   If you're new to the Bible,
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.160]   that idea of Jesus being the Lamb of God,
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.720]   it's a reference to the Old Testament.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.120]   If you're familiar with the story of the Exodus,
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.800]   where the nation of Israel was in captivity to Egypt,
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.760]   and then God sent Moses in to rescue them out,
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.520]   right before they left Egypt,
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.560]   they celebrated what was known as the Passover,
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.520]   where God gave the command to slaughter a lamb
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.040]   and to take the blood and to paint it
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.600]   on the doorpost of their homes,
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.080]   so that when the angel of death swept through the land,
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.960]   the angel of death would pass over
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.040]   the homes of the Israelites.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.560]   And John the Baptist looks and says,
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.360]   "Jesus is our Passover lamb."
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.760]   See, Jesus is the lamb that would be slaughtered
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.600]   for you and me.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.840]   See, when Jesus Christ hung on a cross,
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.520]   that's what was happening.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.640]   His blood was being shed for you and for me.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.560]   And when you put your faith in Jesus Christ,
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.160]   like when you surrender your life,
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.320]   when you give your life to Jesus,
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.480]   you know what you're doing?
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.400]   You're painting the blood of Jesus Christ
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.240]   on the doorposts of your heart.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.600]   So God's wrath now passes over you.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:48.120]   And you no longer come into his judgment,
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.520]   you can be received into his love,
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.800]   his acceptance and his approval.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.240]   You actually are invited into his family.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.480]   Why?
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.880]   Because you know Jesus Christ, the Passover lamb.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.600]   If you flip over real quick to John chapter three,
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.160]   I'll show you one more thing about Jesus.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.360]   John chapter three, this is John the Baptist talking again.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.440]   John the Baptist says this in verse 30, he says,
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.600]   "He," that's Jesus, "must increase, but I must decrease."
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.200]   Put that on a note on your mirror.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.200]   Read that each day in the morning.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.360]   He must increase, but I must decrease.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.680]   He says this, verse 31,
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:29.680]   "He," that's Jesus, "who comes from above is above all.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.480]   "He who is of the earth belongs to the earth
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.400]   "and speaks in an earthly way.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:40.400]   "He who comes from heaven is above all."
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.880]   Do you see that?
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.600]   Jesus is not like us.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.360]   He came from heaven.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:52.480]   We started here on earth and we're aiming to get to heaven.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:57.160]   Jesus had always been in heaven and came to earth
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.280]   to rescue us, to take us to where he is.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.760]   Verse 32, "He bears witness to what he has seen and heard.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.880]   "Yet no one receives his testimony.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.760]   "Whoever receives his testimony sets his seal to this,
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.240]   "to this that God is true.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.640]   "For he whom God has sent utters the words of God,
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.320]   "for he gives the spirit without measure."
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.520]   Watch this, "The father loves the son," that's Jesus,
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.120]   "and has given all things into his hands.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.800]   "Whoever believes in the son has eternal life.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.960]   "Whoever does not obey the son shall not see life,
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.880]   "but the wrath of God remains on him."
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.640]   Do you have clarity on who Jesus is and who he isn't?
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.760]   He's preeminent.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.120]   He's the lamb of God.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:45.000]   And he is the one and only one
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.200]   who can give you eternal life.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.040]   That's who he is.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.920]   Do you have that type of clarity?
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.720]   I wanna speak for a moment to those in the room
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.920]   who have been, if you've been a Christian for a while,
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.080]   I'm especially talking to you right now
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.000]   because you might have just heard everything
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.240]   that I've said and you think to yourself,
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:06.120]   "Yeah, I have clarity on all that."
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.240]   Maybe your theology is intact,
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.280]   but your intimacy with Jesus isn't.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.640]   Here's what I want you to see.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.880]   Flip back over to chapter one.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.160]   I wanna point something out to you.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.000]   Just look real quick at verse 31.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.240]   Says, "I myself did not know him,
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.840]   but for this purpose I came baptizing with water
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.960]   that he might be revealed to Israel.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.720]   In John bore witness,
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:40.400]   I saw the spirit descend from heaven like a dove
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.440]   and it remained on him.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.520]   I myself did not know him,
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.960]   but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me,
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.360]   'He on whom you," what's that next word?
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.920]   "See the spirit descend and remain,
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.800]   that this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit."
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.960]   Verse 34, "And I have," what?
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:04.480]   "Seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God."
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.080]   Do you see what John the Baptist is saying?
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:10.440]   He's saying, "I've seen Jesus.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.720]   I have seen, I've seen Jesus."
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.280]   If you've been a Christian for a while,
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.240]   maybe you have clarity on who he is
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.160]   and who he isn't theologically,
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.720]   but it's been a while since you've seen him
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:31.120]   and experienced him intimately.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.880]   And so I tell you that just to say,
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.880]   like, I just wanna ask you,
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:39.240]   like, when's the last time that you saw Jesus?
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.840]   When's the last time you saw him?
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.360]   Jesus, when he's on a boat with some friends,
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.240]   he's just fed 4,000 people and he gets onto a boat
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.400]   and his friends start complaining
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.560]   that they forgot to bring bread
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:56.240]   and Jesus had just like miraculously made a bunch of bread
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.720]   and he's like, "Guys, do you have eyes
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.880]   and yet you still don't see?"
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.320]   So my question to you,
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.080]   if you've been a Christian for a while,
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.120]   is when's the last time you were captivated
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.320]   by the goodness of Jesus Christ?
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.960]   Because spiritual blindness is simply seeing Jesus
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.640]   without being captivated by his goodness
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.520]   or compelled to worship him.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.360]   So when's the last time you were captivated by his goodness?
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:30.320]   Because maybe you're not living as if Jesus is preeminent
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.600]   because you really don't have practical clarity
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.520]   on who Jesus is and who he isn't.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.800]   Maybe you have theological clarity,
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.520]   your theology is intact,
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:44.520]   but practically you don't live as if he is who he is.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.160]   And it's because you haven't seen him in a while.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.720]   And the reason you haven't seen him
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.880]   is because you haven't taken time
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.320]   to sit with him until you see him.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.680]   Let me ask you this.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:02.920]   Have you ever met anyone whose marriage story,
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.240]   like you sit down with them and you're like,
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.960]   "Hey, so tell me how you met."
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.800]   Have you ever met anyone whose story was,
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.720]   "Well, you know what?
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.040]   We said hi to each other every Monday, Wednesday,
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.160]   and Friday on campus.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.680]   Like we passed each other.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:18.200]   We said hi and we've been married for 30 plus years."
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   That's not a story.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.680]   Because you don't fall in love
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.760]   by just glancing at someone.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:35.520]   You fall in love by gazing at someone.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.480]   So like you take someone out.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.400]   Some people are like, "Hey man, like let's talk about that.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.200]   This isn't a dating talk.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.520]   Ask someone out there.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.360]   That's it.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.600]   That's the dating portion of this talk."
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.080]   But you sit down with someone
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.400]   and you look at them with your eyes
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:35:00.320]   and you ask them questions to learn about who they are.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:04.640]   And then you begin to see them.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.520]   Like I used to work with college students.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.960]   And so some of y'all were college students once.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.960]   So maybe you worked at a camp.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.160]   Anyone ever work at a camp?
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.000]   Maybe not many people.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.520]   Some of you guys, you know.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.080]   So there's camp romance.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.280]   You know, you show up to camp
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.600]   and like, and something happens.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.960]   Like you see a girl on the first day
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.440]   and you don't really think much of it.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.600]   But then like you watch how she drinks
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.960]   from her Nalgene bottle
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.080]   and you watch how she wears her Chacos
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.120]   and how she strings up her hammock.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.800]   And like by the end of camp,
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:44.000]   you have seen her.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.040]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:55.240]   I'm talking about gazing at Jesus until you see him
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.320]   and you're captivated by his beauty.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.800]   See, we live in a world that wants to convince you
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.400]   that you can just live off of glances.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.880]   And so the Christian world is trying to like shorten
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.720]   and expedite your time with Jesus.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.560]   It's like, you know what?
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.440]   We've got apps for that.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.560]   And like for just three minutes a day,
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.920]   here's this quick devotional.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.440]   You just click play and you know what?
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.000]   You can do a double speed.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.120]   So you talk really fast
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.800]   and you can just get it done.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.000]   But Jesus loves you too much to give you all of himself
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:23.840]   in three minutes.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.360]   And yet you're like, I don't know why.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.160]   I just feel so spiritually dry.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.800]   I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:35.000]   Let me, no date with my wife has ever gone well
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.040]   for just three minutes.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.600]   It's like, okay, let's just get this done.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.160]   Okay, like here's what we're gonna order
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.600]   and let's just eat real fast.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.160]   And let's just, fill me in like that.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.520]   Oh, like that type of efficiency.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:50.400]   It doesn't manufacture intimacy.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:54.520]   Efficiency is the enemy of intimacy when it comes to Jesus.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.160]   And so I tell you that,
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:01.400]   I tell you that because the joy
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:05.840]   is found in sitting with him until you see him.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.680]   Because when you gaze at him,
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.120]   you begin to taste and see that he's good.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.840]   And so I tell you that because true greatness,
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:23.520]   greatness requires clarity on who Jesus is and who he isn't.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.880]   And some of you need to get where you can see him
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:32.200]   so that you can get clear again on who he truly is.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:37.680]   Finally, greatness requires clarity
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:42.320]   on what you were put on earth to do.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.440]   Are you clear on that?
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.600]   Are you clear on what you were put on earth to do?
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.440]   I mean, that's probably a pretty big question
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.960]   for people in this life stage to be figuring out.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:56.720]   Like God, what did you put me on earth to do?
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.240]   Greatness requires clarity
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.000]   on what you were put on earth to do.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.840]   Look back, John chapter one.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.640]   Let me just show you a few things real quick.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.840]   Verse 29.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.280]   Again, it says this,
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.720]   "The next day he, John the Baptist, saw Jesus
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.680]   coming toward him, and what did he say?
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.200]   'Behold, the Lamb of God,
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.360]   who takes away the sin of the world.'"
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.480]   Skip down to verse 34.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.160]   "I have seen and bore witness that this is the Son of God."
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.600]   Verse 35, "The next day again,
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:33.360]   John was standing with two of his disciples,
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.560]   and he looked at Jesus as he walked by,
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.520]   and said, 'Behold, the Lamb of God.'"
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.200]   The two disciples heard him saying this,
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.040]   and what did they do?
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.400]   They followed Jesus.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.840]   So here's what I want you to see, okay?
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:51.000]   John the Baptist saw Jesus,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.600]   and because he saw Jesus,
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.160]   he wanted other people to see Jesus.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:59.000]   He sees Jesus, and what does he say to his disciples?
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.720]   "Behold, the Lamb of God."
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.320]   And what do his disciples,
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.960]   the people that are following him, what do they do?
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.400]   They stop following him and start following Jesus.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:12.400]   How backwards does that sound to us in 2022?
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.320]   Because 2022 is all about gaining followers,
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.880]   not losing followers.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:23.920]   But John the Baptist didn't need to keep people.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.960]   He was great at releasing people
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:31.520]   so that they could see what he had seen.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.200]   And so I tell you that just to say,
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.160]   you know what, until you see Jesus,
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:43.400]   you are going to live to be seen like Jesus.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.480]   Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.760]   Until you see Jesus,
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.080]   you're going to live to be seen like Jesus.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.040]   You're gonna want people to see you,
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.160]   that you're gonna want them to consider you
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.720]   someone who influences them as an influencer.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.880]   You're gonna want people to respect you
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.600]   and want to be around you and want to follow you
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.960]   and think that everything about you is amazing.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.280]   Until you see Jesus,
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.640]   you're going to live to be seen like Jesus.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.080]   But when you see Jesus,
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:16.320]   you will want others to see Jesus.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:22.520]   Several years ago, I developed this interest
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.040]   in the Tour de France, which is a famous bike race.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.960]   I would imagine the majority of people in here
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.040]   are like, what is that?
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.880]   Like, bike races aren't your thing.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.480]   And I wouldn't say they're my thing.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.120]   I'm just saying that I've developed an interest
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.320]   in the Tour de France.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:42.320]   And the Tour de France is this couple thousand long mile
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.480]   bike race through France.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:48.040]   And it spans over 20 days.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:53.040]   And it's teams competing against other teams.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:58.560]   Like you can't win the Tour de France
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.680]   without a team.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:05.640]   So teams will choose a leader.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:09.320]   They will choose a leader for their team.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.080]   And then the other team members will ride
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:15.400]   for that leader to win.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.760]   And there's this terminology in bicycle racing.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.680]   It's a French word known as the domestique.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:27.520]   The domestique is the person who sacrifices their race
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.520]   for the race of the leader.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.200]   So like if the leader on their team gets a flat tire,
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.600]   the domestique will ride up, will stop,
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.360]   give them their bike so that the leader can keep going.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.760]   And then the domestique will stay there with that bike
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:42.880]   and fix the tire.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.920]   Like if the leader is thirsty and doesn't have
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.080]   any more water, the domestique will slow down
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.000]   and go to their team's car and then pedal back up
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.040]   to the leader, give them some water.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.400]   If they're riding and win, the domestique will stop,
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.680]   will get in front of the leader so that the leader
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.640]   can draft off of them.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:07.960]   That person, the domestique, rides for someone else to win.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:12.720]   But it's interesting, years ago,
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.120]   back before Lance Armstrong was busted for doping,
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:20.120]   there was this moment where Lance Armstrong was riding
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:24.280]   for Team Astana.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.400]   And there was also a guy on Team Astana
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.720]   named Alberto Contador.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.280]   And both Lance Armstrong and Alberto Contador
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.400]   believed that they should be the appointed leader.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.600]   And so there were these commercials that would come out
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:41.600]   and it was like, Armstrong, Contador, who's it gonna be?
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.400]   Who should be the leader of Team Astana?
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:49.440]   And it was like this competition, like, you know what?
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.560]   It's unsure who should ride for who.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:58.880]   See, clarity on what you were put on earth to do
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:03.000]   comes with deciding who's gonna ride for who.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.080]   You're either going to believe that you exist for God
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.960]   or God exists for you.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:14.920]   And so, stepping into the point and purpose of your life
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.120]   is you stepping into a place where you say,
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.720]   Jesus Christ, you are the leader
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.200]   and I exist to ride for you.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.480]   And Jesus, you already have won.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.120]   You have already beat sin.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.920]   You have already beat death.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.920]   And yet I ride so that the world may know your victory.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.680]   That this world may know that you, Jesus,
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:41.520]   have conquered sin and death to make us right with God.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:44.320]   That's why you exist.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.680]   I don't know if you've come to that realization yet,
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:51.680]   but you exist to know Jesus Christ and make him known.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.600]   Francis Chan says this,
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.560]   the point of your life is to point to him.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.920]   Whatever you are doing, God wants to be glorified
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.080]   because this whole thing is his.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.440]   It's his movie, his world, his gift.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:11.520]   A.W. Tozer says, if my fire is not large, it is yet real.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:16.080]   And there may be those who can light their candle
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.760]   at its flame.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:22.640]   He's saying that I have a fire in my bones for Jesus
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.720]   and I want people to come
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:28.240]   and light their candle off of that flame.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:33.840]   I wanna bring you back to Matthew chapter 11,
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.960]   where Jesus declared that John the Baptist was the goat.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:41.720]   But what's interesting is how Jesus finishes that verse.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.840]   Look back at it real quick.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.880]   Jesus says, truly I say to you,
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.160]   among those born of women,
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.640]   there is arisen no one greater than John the Baptist.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.280]   Watch this, yet the one who is least
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.760]   in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.280]   What's Jesus saying?
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.280]   Well, here's what he's saying.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.320]   Don't miss what I'm telling you.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:08.240]   He's saying John the Baptist was the last person
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.880]   to do something really significant.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.400]   John the Baptist came to say, the king is coming.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.880]   The king is coming.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.320]   The king is coming.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:21.200]   But now we sit on the other side of the king coming.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.800]   The king has come.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.600]   The king has conquered Satan, sin and death.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:31.360]   And so while John the Baptist never got to see that,
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.720]   we have.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.600]   And Jesus says, that's what makes you great
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.560]   is when you come to a place where you say,
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.560]   I've seen the king.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:45.400]   I've seen King Jesus.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:49.080]   And I've realized that he conquered sin for me.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.760]   He got on the cross for me.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.920]   He rose from the dead for me.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:59.840]   Jesus came so that I may have life.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.480]   Jesus says, that's true greatness.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:08.440]   True greatness is found in knowing Jesus.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.480]   Do you know him?
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.320]   If you do know him,
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.640]   would you realize tonight you're not the Christ,
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.880]   you've been made for a relationship with him?
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.760]   Would you get where you can see him?
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.240]   Would you gaze at him?
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:28.120]   And would you begin to live a life
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.440]   that doesn't say, look at me?
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.560]   Would you live a life that declares, look at him?
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.600]   Let's pray together.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.200]   (gentle music)
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:46.720]   And let me just ask, if you're here tonight
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:51.680]   and you're seeing Jesus clearly for the first time,
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:55.280]   like you've just gotten clarity for the first time
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.840]   on who he is,
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:02.560]   that he is the king that was crucified,
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.720]   that he died for your sins,
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.040]   he was buried for your sins,
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:09.080]   he rose from the dead conquering your sins,
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.520]   that when you put your trust in him,
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:16.760]   forgiveness comes and you're made right with a perfect God.
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.160]   If that's you,
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:21.080]   if you wanna begin a relationship with Jesus right now,
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:24.240]   would you just in the quietness of your own heart,
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.560]   would you just say these words?
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.720]   Would you say, Jesus Christ, come into my life tonight?
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:32.280]   Just tell him, say, thank you, Jesus,
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.320]   that you died for me.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:37.600]   Thank you, Jesus, that you rose from the dead for me.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.360]   Would you come into my life?
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:44.000]   Would you forgive me of my sins?
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.360]   And would you begin to lead me in a new life
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:54.200]   with you as my savior and as my king?
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:59.800]   If that's you, if you just invited Christ in your life,
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.280]   welcome to the family of God,
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.560]   would you tell someone tonight
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.040]   so that they can celebrate with you?
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:08.320]   If you're here tonight and you already knew Jesus,
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.600]   would you sit with him even now?
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.520]   Would you gaze at him now?
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:17.320]   And would you ask him to use you
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:20.280]   to put him on display to the world around you?
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:23.760]   Jesus, we need you and we love you.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:26.800]   We thank you for your love for us.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.120]   God, may we be people who are clear
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.560]   on who we are and who we aren't.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.880]   May we be clear on who you are and who you aren't.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.560]   And may we be clear, Lord God,
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:40.200]   may this room be 3,000 strong of people who go out
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:45.200]   with great clarity on what they have been put on earth to do.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.160]   In Jesus' name, amen.
