1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 She told me they went to Cabo and he paid for the whole thing.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 Dude, she does his laundry and cooks.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,800
 He proposed at the Eiffel Tower. In Paris.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,500
 Bro, she plays in his fantasy football league and knows more about the Cowboys than he does.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,000
 She's got the husband, the house, she's got it all. What more could you ask for?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,500
 Hey, what more could you ask for?

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,000
 Because she's got it all.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 I don't think that's how that song goes.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Oh, okay. Alright.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 What's up, guys? Alright, hello, friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth, in Houston, and in the woodlands.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 We are so excited about what we're about to do tonight as we finish up this series of relationship goals.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,500
 But before we kick off this Q&A of all the questions that you guys asked this week,

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,500
 we had questions coming in from Houston on our Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, all across the board,

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,000
 emails, and using the app.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 We also have provided a way for you to text in live questions tonight.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,500
 Text in live--yeah, I know, get excited.

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,000
 Text in live questions tonight.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,500
 And we are going to do our best to fly through as many of these questions as we can,

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,500
 not only from throughout the week, which we will prioritize the ones that have already been sent in.

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:15,500
 And then if we do not get to your question tonight, tomorrow at 11.30, Facebook, on Facebook,

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,500
 on the Porch Facebook page, we will do a Facebook Live at 11.30.

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
 Yeah, man, I love it.

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,500
 And we will fly through as many questions for probably like 15 to 20 minutes as we can.

24
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,500
 And if nothing else, JP will beatbox tomorrow at 11.30.

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
 You don't want to miss it.

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
 It's going to be amazing.

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,500
 It is going to be amazing.

28
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,500
 I'm looking forward to it already.

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,500
 So with that being said, we're going to kick off tonight of a number of the different questions that came in

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,500
 throughout the weekend.

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,500
 If you want to text in your questions, the number is on the screen, 469-759-3797.

32
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:52,500
 And Emily Corley, a crucial part of the Young Adult staff, is going to be sending them to me throughout this night.

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
 Her husband is clapping on the front row.

34
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,500
 Got to love that.

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,500
 Relationship goals.

36
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,500
 And we will kick off as we just explore these questions tonight.

37
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,500
 You ready?

38
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
 Hi, David.

39
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
 Hey, Jonathan Picluda, everybody.

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,500
 I like your shirt.

41
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,500
 Jonathan Bob Picluda.

42
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,500
 Thank you.

43
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,500
 That's question number one.

44
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,500
 Is your middle name really Bob, not Robert?

45
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
 It is not Robert or Bobby.

46
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,500
 It is just Bob.

47
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
 That's a fact.

48
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,500
 All right.

49
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
 Question number one.

50
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,500
 This may have been -- man, I'm excited.

51
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,500
 This is going to be great.

52
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,500
 Let's go, dude.

53
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,500
 Come on.

54
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
 I got a hoodie on my shirt.

55
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,500
 Yeah, you do.

56
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,500
 And buttons on the front, man.

57
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
 It's like business in the front, party in the back.

58
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
 I like it, man.

59
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
 It's a little warmer than I thought.

60
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,500
 It's amazing.

61
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
 I'm ready to roll.

62
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,500
 All right, question number one is maybe the most asked question that we got.

63
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,500
 And I feel like you fired this one up on people, so we need you to clarify it for them.

64
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,500
 And it's all related to attraction and chemistry.

65
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,500
 Specifically, the question came in over and over again, how important is attraction in chemistry?

66
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,500
 Like if a guy asks me out, if I'm a girl, and he asks me out and I'm not --

67
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
 Hold on.

68
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
 Let me -- okay, David's a girl.

69
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
 Got it.

70
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
 He asked me out and I'm not attracted to him at all.

71
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
 So if a guy asks you out.

72
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:20,500
 So with that -- or if you're a guy and you're taking out a girl, it's a few dates in, man, the spark is just not there.

73
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:27,500
 She meets all the criteria of like a godly girl, but you're like, man, I just don't know that I want to keep moving forward with this.

74
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
 Or another one was, hey, does physical attraction matter at all?

75
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
 Is it a deal breaker if you're not attracted?

76
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
 Okay.

77
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
 So a couple things.

78
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
 I think it depends on what you mean by chemistry.

79
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,500
 And if we're looping like chemistry and attraction all into the same bucket, here's what I would say.

80
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
 Attraction attracts.

81
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
 That's what it does.

82
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 It is -- I mean God made us, you know, visual beings.

83
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,500
 And so there's no mystery that different people are attracted to different things.

84
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
 And you've got to understand where that attraction comes from.

85
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:08,500
 I think so often in our culture today it's fed through pornography or through struggles or addictions, and that really informs what we're attracted to.

86
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
 We fed our heart something.

87
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,500
 Proverbs 4.23 just talks about guarding your heart for the wellspring of life.

88
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,500
 Specifically it's saying that your heart chases after things.

89
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:26,500
 And so when you feed it a particular kind of stuff, that is -- you're giving your heart like a bloodhound, a scent for something, and it's seeking that.

90
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,500
 A lot of times what your heart is seeking is what's not good for you because that's what you fed your heart.

91
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:40,500
 And so am I saying that you should find the ugliest person that you can hardly even stand to look at and be a martyr for the rest of your life and marry them?

92
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
 No. I mean, absolutely not.

93
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,500
 But here's what I would say, and I want you to hear this because I'm often -- I don't want this to be a misunderstanding.

94
00:04:47,500 --> 00:05:01,500
 If they're a godly person and you're not attracted to them, that may be your maturity issue.

95
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,500
 God says that he does not look at the things that man looks at. He examines the heart.

96
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:14,500
 And so as you are on a sanctification process, you are not yet attracted to what God is attracted to.

97
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,500
 Now, if you say, "Well, what if they're just a stick in the mud? What if they're boring?"

98
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,500
 Then I would say, "Well, maybe they're not as godly as you think they are because godly people aren't boring."

99
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,500
 Godly people are some of the most fun people on the planet. I mean, they understand why we're here.

100
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,500
 And so all of those things I think play a role into it.

101
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,500
 Is physical attraction important? Physical attraction attracts and then it stops.

102
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,500
 "Charm is deceitful, beauty is fleeting," Proverbs 31:30 says.

103
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,500
 And so it is fleeting.

104
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:50,500
 And so if you invest on physical attraction, you need to know you're investing in a depreciating asset.

105
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,500
 You are buying something that is diminishing.

106
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,500
 And people don't think that way. We often say that physical attraction is ultimate.

107
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,500
 That's what's most important. And I would tell you it is the fastest fleeting thing.

108
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,500
 I always say, like I said during the series, "Are you attracted to an 80-year-old?"

109
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:13,500
 Well, by the grace of God, I hope your spouse will one day be 80 and you need to be committed to them.

110
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,500
 You need to be able to cherish them. And that goes way far beyond physical attraction.

111
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,500
 That's great. Okay, so this next question is related to just doubts.

112
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,500
 A lot of people ask the same form of the same question, which is, "Hey, what if I'm dating someone

113
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,500
 and I'm just having doubts about the relationship moving forward? Is that a deal breaker?"

114
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,500
 In other words, I think they've heard this idea of, "Hey, when you know, you know."

115
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,500
 And so if I don't know, then I guess I know that I don't know, and so I should break up.

116
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,500
 Is that true? Or is that a, you know, speak to that idea.

117
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,500
 Man, let me say this up front. And it's just this, I think it's important for every question.

118
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,500
 My hunch is it's important for every question we're going to be asked tonight.

119
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,500
 Friends, I want you to hear me. And I want you to test this too.

120
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
 And don't take my word for it. See if this is true.

121
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:09,500
 And I don't mean to discourage you with this. I mean to kind of hit reset on your life a little bit.

122
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,500
 I believe we are so far from where we should be.

123
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,500
 I don't think we're close. I don't think we're barely missing this deal.

124
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:26,500
 There are a few things in our culture today that are so far from biblical values and biblical ideals.

125
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,500
 So what you're going to hear a lot of is, you know, the scripture says, the Bible says,

126
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,500
 we're not just pulling out this old book that's, you know, thousands of years old and dusting it off and saying,

127
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,500
 here's your best, take some relationship advice from this.

128
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:46,500
 We're saying, hey, we believe that the creator of the universe gave us a handbook to understanding the most important relationship there is.

129
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,500
 And when we get that in place, all these other things begin to fall in place too.

130
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,500
 And so I think that's what's most important.

131
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,500
 And back to your question, I would say it depends on what you mean by doubt. Do doubts mark your life?

132
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,500
 Are you a person who is kind of paralysis by analysis all the time?

133
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
 Are you questioning every decision you make?

134
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,500
 Because if that's the case, you may have a bigger problem that you need to recover from, pursue recovery in,

135
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,500
 before you jump into a dating relationship.

136
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,500
 Because at the end of the day, this dating relationship, I hope, leads to a decision.

137
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,500
 That decision is a commitment. It's actually a covenant.

138
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,500
 It is a one-sided commitment. It is, I will, regardless of what you do.

139
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,500
 That's the covenant of marriage. Whether you cheat on me, whether you leave me, whatever you do, right?

140
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,500
 I am committed to you regardless. That's really what you're saying at marriage.

141
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:46,500
 It is a covenant. It is, you know, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part.

142
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:53,500
 If we go on the honeymoon, and on the way back from the honeymoon, you get in a car accident, and you slide 300 yards on your face,

143
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,500
 and you're completely dismembered, and I have to change your diaper for the rest of my life,

144
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,500
 and feed you mashed potatoes until I leave this place, I'm in.

145
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,500
 But my hunch is, nobody thought about that.

146
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,500
 Nobody thought, "Yeah, that's probably the story that's going to happen to me."

147
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
 The good news is, it probably isn't.

148
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:17,500
 But if it is, that's what you're signing up for. You need to be aware of that.

149
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,500
 That flies in the face of what culture says, when it just says, "Hey, you need to be happy."

150
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,500
 And so if you're questioning, it depends on why you're questioning.

151
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
 Are you questioning because of their level of commitment to Christ?

152
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
 Or are you questioning, "Am I actually attracted to Him?"

153
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,500
 I think it depends on the why, and this is something that, you know, another reason why community is so important.

154
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
 They can flesh out those individual things.

155
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,500
 Yeah, that's good. I'm going to skip the next one, because it's, "How do I know if they're the one?"

156
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
 Which essentially is answered by that previous one.

157
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,500
 But to your point on, "Hey, are you doubting for the wrong reasons?"

158
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,500
 A lot of times we doubt because we're like, "Are they pretty enough? Do they like the things that I like?

159
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,500
 Can she cook well enough? Does he make enough money?"

160
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:59,500
 We doubt for the wrong reasons, and then we, the things that we should be focusing on,

161
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,500
 their relationship with Christ, those are the reasons why you should doubt, if that makes sense.

162
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
 In other words, if they're not committed, if they're not a part of a church,

163
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,500
 if they're not all in with Jesus, if He's not the focus and priority of your life,

164
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,500
 you should doubt and break up tonight.

165
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,500
 If you're concerned because you like the Cowboys, and you don't think that she's on board with that,

166
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,500
 that's a bad reason to doubt the relationship.

167
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
 It may be like an idol in your life, but if you're going to break up,

168
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,500
 it's the essentials that Scripture lays out that are great reasons to break up and to doubt your relationship.

169
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,500
 Yeah, yes. Let's take the one, if you don't mind.

170
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
 Yeah, go.

171
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,500
 I've said this before. I will probably say this every year, maybe twice a year.

172
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,500
 I always say, "Is there someone out there better suited for Monica than I?"

173
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,500
 If you don't know Monica, my wife, we just celebrated 12 years of marriage last weekend.

174
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
 We've been married for 12 years. Thank you, guys.

175
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,500
 [applause]

176
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,500
 I'm six feet, seven inches tall. That's in the weird tall category.

177
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,500
 It is weird tall, people. He is humongous.

178
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
 People call David the short guy.

179
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,500
 They're like, "Man, the short guy." I'm like, "Dude, I am six feet tall. You shut your mouth."

180
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
 I say it a lot more lovingly than that.

181
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
 But you're not bitter. It's a good thing.

182
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
 No, man. I love them.

183
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,500
 I'm six-seven. She's five-three.

184
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:20,500
 I am harsh. I'm a prophet, meaning I'm a truth-teller. I kind of cut to the chase.

185
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,500
 She's the most loving, gentle, patient person you'll ever meet in your life.

186
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
 We are very different in every way.

187
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:34,500
 I bet you on a compatibility test, there are probably hundreds of thousands of men more compatible with Monica than I.

188
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,500
 The reality of it is two sinners are incompatible.

189
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,500
 When two sinners come together, two human beings, there's no compatibility between human beings.

190
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,500
 It is a regular, "Hey, we are committed to each other. We're going to be sanctified through this process."

191
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
 I don't mean to paint it like it's all work.

192
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,500
 As incompatible as Monica and I are, we have so much fun in marriage.

193
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,500
 The past 12 years, 11 of them at least, have been an absolute blast.

194
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
 The first one, really year two, we really struggled.

195
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,500
 Then God's grace overwhelmed our marriage through community.

196
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,500
 It's been up and to the right ever since.

197
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,500
 Just forget this idea. You're not looking for the one.

198
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
 You're not looking for the one.

199
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,500
 You're looking for someone who, and fill in the blank.

200
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
 Friends, you've got to fill in the blank.

201
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,500
 You've got to be really honest with yourselves.

202
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
 Go to your community group.

203
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,500
 Again, if you're not in community, we said it before, you probably shouldn't be dating.

204
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
 Dating is not for the faint of heart.

205
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
 You need to be in the context of other believers.

206
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,500
 They need to have insight into what you're doing and how you're treating the opposite sex.

207
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:42,500
 If you're like, "Hey, I'm looking for someone who has big boobs."

208
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,500
 Cool. Tell them that so that they can speak truth into that lie.

209
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
 When I say cool, I don't mean that's okay.

210
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
 I mean you need to be that honest.

211
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,500
 If that's on the list, then put that on the list.

212
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,500
 What I would tell you and what we've said over and over through this relationship

213
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,500
 is you're looking for someone who is fully committed to Christ,

214
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,500
 who you can double the strength of your ministry with,

215
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,500
 that you can go to war with these folks,

216
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
 that you can change the world with these folks.

217
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,500
 You look at them, you lock arms, you say, "Okay, let's go. Let's run hard and fast."

218
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,500
 If you're looking for someone who is a doctor, you need to say that.

219
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,500
 You say that to your girls. Say that to the girls that you're running with.

220
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,500
 Let them speak truth into that and say, "Hey, we think you've added a criteria that is extra biblical.

221
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
 That is not in the Scripture."

222
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
 I think you're not looking for the one.

223
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,500
 You're looking for someone who blank, and you need to fill in the blank.

224
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:43,500
 What I would encourage you to fill in the blank with is running with reckless abandonment towards Christ.

225
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
 Love it.

226
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:51,500
 Here's one that we've gotten texted in a ton apparently, which is, "Does age matter in dating?"

227
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,500
 What would the Bible say about someone, for example, a 26-year-old dating a 46-year-old?

228
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
 Oh, you're talking about age gap?

229
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 Yeah, age gap.

230
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:07,500
 Yeah, I think there's—I mean, we obey the laws of the land, and so there are some Scriptures there.

231
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,500
 But I look out there, I see Shane B. I mean, you're like 42 years older than your wife, right?

232
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
 Isn't that right?

233
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
 He loves it.

234
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
 I'm just kidding.

235
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
 I'm just kidding.

236
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
 That is not true.

237
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
 It's not true.

238
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
 It's not even close.

239
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
 It's not true.

240
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:31,500
 No, I don't think—the Scripture does not speak into age, to the best of my awareness, outside of the laws of our land.

241
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,500
 But I will say, "Date when you're ready to marry."

242
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
 We've said that over and over.

243
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
 We date for marriage.

244
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,500
 And so some people asked—you had said that some people asked—

245
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
 About college or about—

246
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:49,500
 Yeah, they were like, "You believe in early engagement or short dating. Date for a short period of time.

247
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
 But what if you start dating in high school or college when you're not ready for marriage?"

248
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
 Don't do that.

249
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
 That's the quick answer there.

250
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
 That's foolish.

251
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,500
 I know that flies in the face of what culture's telling you, man.

252
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:05,500
 I know you've been dating since the fifth grade, but don't do—I mean, like, yeah, and just look backwards.

253
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,500
 Like, take a look in the rearview mirror, for those of you who've been dating since the fifth grade,

254
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,500
 and look at the carnage piled up on the side of the highway, all the broken relationships, all the hurts,

255
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,500
 all the heartaches, the sleepless nights, the crying yourself to sleep.

256
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,500
 I mean, why not just start dating when you can get married?

257
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
 I told you, I think it's God's ideal.

258
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
 I believe from the Scriptures it's God's ideal that you do this once,

259
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,500
 that you would give your heart away one single time.

260
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
 I know that's crazy, but—

261
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,500
 That's good.

262
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
 All right.

263
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
 This is a very—

264
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
 Shane B. and Beth have an amazing marriage, I should tell you that.

265
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
 So, way to go.

266
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
 Way to go, Shane.

267
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,500
 Is online dating okay?

268
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,500
 One in three couples today get married online, and specifically, can the porch start an online dating service?

269
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:58,500
 And so this is all, like—this was all a ploy to roll this out, and so the porch is starting an online dating—

270
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
 Yes, we are.

271
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
 It's going to go Tinder with an E.

272
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
 Yeah.

273
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
 Looking for your Tinder warrior.

274
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
 Tinder-hearted.

275
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,500
 It's going to be awesome.

276
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,500
 That's so not true.

277
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
 And not an endorsement for Tinder.

278
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,500
 Get off Tinder if you're on it.

279
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
 So—

280
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
 Online dating.

281
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,500
 Second Hezekiah really speaks into this online dating—

282
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
 No, it doesn't.

283
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
 I'm kidding.

284
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
 Some of you are like, "Where is that in the Bible?"

285
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
 It doesn't speak.

286
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,500
 Yeah, believe it or not, the Bible doesn't mention online dating one time.

287
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,500
 I didn't even talk about the internet. It's crazy.

288
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,500
 It's crazy.

289
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
 Here's what I would say, man.

290
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,500
 In dating—and this is what I want you to hear—

291
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,500
 You're choosing your problems, right?

292
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
 You're choosing your problems.

293
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:56,500
 And so I like—I'm a big fan of the model of, like, you running together, you serving together,

294
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,500
 you observing each other as you serve at the porch and serve in church,

295
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,500
 you know, you're constantly—you're going on international trips, like, through church.

296
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
 Let me specify.

297
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
 Through church.

298
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
 Not like, "We backpacked to Europe together."

299
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500
 No, but you're going and you're serving in the church together.

300
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,500
 You're constantly bumping up against the same person, seeing the same person.

301
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
 You've observed them.

302
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
 You know they're running hard after Christ.

303
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
 And then it's like, "Hey, let's spend the rest of our lives together."

304
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
 I'm a big fan of that model.

305
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,500
 I've seen that work really well.

306
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:32,500
 You're trying to ensure who they are as you go and spend time with them in a dating fashion.

307
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,500
 And I would just tell you, profiles lie.

308
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,500
 I can be anybody I want to be online, right?

309
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,500
 So I can take a picture of David, for example, and say, "Here's who I am."

310
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,500
 And that's what I would do if I was single.

311
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,500
 And so just be cautious.

312
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
 You're choosing your problems.

313
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,500
 The Scripture says all things are permissible, but not all things are beneficial.

314
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,500
 I'm not going to tell you you can't do it because the Bible doesn't say that you can't do it.

315
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
 But you need to be wise.

316
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
 I wouldn't do it in isolation.

317
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,500
 I'd make sure that your community is completely aware.

318
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,500
 And not all dating apps and sites are created equal.

319
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,500
 So if there's Tinder or eHarmony or whatever that is, just be wise where you're spending your time.

320
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:19,500
 And if you become addicted to it, like if you wake up and you can't wait to check to see if somebody swiped right or left or up or down,

321
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
 you just need to be wise.

322
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
 You probably got an addiction.

323
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
 You need to stop.

324
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
 You need to fast from that.

325
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
 You need to confess it and move towards Christ.

326
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
 Anything you'd add, David?

327
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
 That's awesome.

328
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
 I think you hit it.

329
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,500
 I think it's really good, especially the idea of not all dating sites are created equal.

330
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,500
 And so Tinder is very different from--

331
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,500
 What dating site did you meet Callie on?

332
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
 It was Farmers Only.

333
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
 [laughter]

334
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
 I just love a farm girl, man.

335
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
 Amen.

336
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
 Nothing wrong with that.

337
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
 That is not true.

338
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,500
 Nothing against Farmers Only, and this is not an official endorsement for Farmers Only.

339
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
 All right.

340
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,500
 I feel like we answered this one, but the next one was, "Hey, when should you get engaged?"

341
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,500
 When should you get engaged?

342
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
 Yeah, I feel like we hit that.

343
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
 But in other words, the amount of time.

344
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,500
 I think in one of the messages that we did in the past few weeks, there was something like, "Man, date.

345
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,500
 And once you know that they are a godly spouse, meet the biblical criteria.

346
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
 Put a ring on it.

347
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
 Let's do this tonight."

348
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,500
 And so I think people were like, "Man, that feels really fast."

349
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,500
 And so what is the appropriate amount of time to date before you get engaged?

350
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
 Let me shoot you real straight.

351
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
 I've been single.

352
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
 I've been dating.

353
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
 And I've been married.

354
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
 Okay?

355
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,500
 Dating is the least fun of the three.

356
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
 Okay?

357
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:41,500
 Single, hanging out with your boys, hanging out with your girls, seeing the world, spending time together, getting to know each other, living in community, fellowship at that level.

358
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
 Man, that's a lot of fun.

359
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:54,500
 Marriage, running hard, doubling the strength of ministry, getting to raise kids together, getting to experience kind of all of the seasons that life throw at you together.

360
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
 It's a lot of fun.

361
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,500
 Dating is the least fun of the three.

362
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,500
 And so I would do that as short as possible.

363
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
 And so you've got to do that strategically.

364
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
 Okay?

365
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:12,500
 And that means, man, I want to effectively and efficiently make sure this person is who I think they are.

366
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:21,500
 And as soon as I'm certain that they are completely, truly, madly, deeply in love with Jesus Christ and I enjoy spending time with them, I would get married.

367
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
 Okay?

368
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,500
 And so some of you girls are like, man, I don't know if you noticed this, but it's not up to me.

369
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:38,500
 And somebody emailed me the other day and they were like, you know, my boyfriend, you know, he wants to date for like five years before we get married.

370
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,500
 And so like how do I gently approach the topic?

371
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
 And so this is what I said.

372
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,500
 Okay, I'm just going to let you in.

373
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
 I said, here's how I gently approach the topic.

374
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,500
 I no longer want to be dating you.

375
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
 Okay?

376
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
 This was fun.

377
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,500
 But you are no longer the one I'm interested in.

378
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
 Because you don't meet that.

379
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
 That's how I gently approach the topic.

380
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
 I mean that as lovingly as I possibly can.

381
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
 Felt like it.

382
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,500
 I love it, man.

383
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
 I think it's really good.

384
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:16,500
 I think what you're doing there is you're telling the girl that -- in other words, the idea of, hey, it's not really up to me is not true.

385
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
 It's not entirely true.

386
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,500
 Because there's a level in which you could do exactly that.

387
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
 Oh, you want to date for five years.

388
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,500
 I'm no longer going to date you if that's the case.

389
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:35,500
 And so there is a level in which you can progress the relationship or be a part of moving it or moving yourself towards the direction of a relationship that will move towards marriage.

390
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
 Okay, so this one related to that.

391
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
 How do I know if I'm ready to date?

392
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,500
 How do I know if I'm ready to be dating or marriage?

393
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
 Because they're kind of in the same season.

394
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
 I shouldn't date until I'm ready to be married.

395
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,500
 And so how do I know that I'm ready to even date?

396
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,500
 So we say date for marriage.

397
00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:01,500
 I would read Ephesians 5, 1 Peter 3, Colossians 3.

398
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
 I'd read the Proverbs.

399
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,500
 And I would read all the verses in the scripture that have to do with marriage.

400
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,500
 And I would ask myself, man, am I ready for that?

401
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:22,500
 And then, you know, as I think back on that message we did with the suitcases on stage, baggage claim, I would ask, hey, is there a sin struggle that marks me?

402
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:30,500
 Is there something -- when I say sin struggle that marks me, I mean something that you are not currently working through.

403
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:36,500
 And by currently working through, I don't mean, man, I fall into it every single week.

404
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
 That's a sin.

405
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
 That's more than a sin struggle.

406
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
 Like that's an addiction.

407
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,500
 Like that's something that's owning your life right now.

408
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,500
 And so before you bring someone into that struggle, you need to get well.

409
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
 We have something here on Monday nights called regeneration.

410
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,500
 We're doing a regeneration conference this week.

411
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,500
 I'd strongly encourage -- man, if you're like -- all the time I get these emails, man, I'm addicted to pornography.

412
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
 I don't know what to do.

413
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
 What do I do?

414
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
 You show up here Monday night for the next 12 months.

415
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
 That's what you do.

416
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
 That is your next step.

417
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
 You show up here.

418
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,500
 You say -- you raise your hand.

419
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
 You say, hey, I'm addicted to porn.

420
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
 I need help.

421
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
 Okay?

422
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,500
 And we will help you in that recovery process.

423
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,500
 But, yeah.

424
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
 >> Community.

425
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,500
 We've talked about that a lot too.

426
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
 Making sure you're connected to a local church.

427
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
 Don't date in isolation.

428
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,500
 Just the danger of walking through that without having wise counselors involved.

429
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,500
 So that could be another -- make sure you're in community before you start dating someone.

430
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
 But I think it's great.

431
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
 Anything else you'd add?

432
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
 >> No, that's great.

433
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
 >> Love it.

434
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
 All right.

435
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
 So this question came in in a number of different forms.

436
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,500
 But what does it look like to follow or submit in dating?

437
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
 What does it look like to lead well?

438
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:54,500
 The guy role, the woman following and submitting is clearly laid out in scripture just like it is for the husband as well to submit to one another out of reverence for Christ, Ephesians says.

439
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,500
 So it's not just the wife's role.

440
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
 It's the husband's role as well.

441
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
 And all of us as believers in Christ.

442
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,500
 But you hear that often.

443
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
 Like guys lead well.

444
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,500
 Women follow and follow along, follow a godly leader who's leading in that direction.

445
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
 What does it look like to do that in dating?

446
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,500
 Should that even take place in dating?

447
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,500
 >> Yeah, and so that's what?

448
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:23,500
 Ephesians 5, 1 Peter 3, talk about this idea of submitting to who?

449
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
 Women submit to who?

450
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,500
 It actually says wives submit to who?

451
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
 >> Your husbands.

452
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500
 >> Your husbands.

453
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
 I think that's really important.

454
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:43,500
 Wives submit to your husbands, not to your boyfriends, not even to your fiancés, but to your husbands.

455
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,500
 And so women always think like, man, we got the short end of the stick of this deal.

456
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
 Somebody's excited.

457
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,500
 That's good.

458
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,500
 And so here's what I would say, though, here to get even more excited about this.

459
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:00,500
 I would tell you that the like tall drink of water, the tall order is actually on the man in those verses.

460
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:09,500
 Because before, when it talks about wives submit to your husbands, it says, husbands, love your wives as who?

461
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
 >> Christ.

462
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,500
 >> As Christ loved the church and laid his life down for her.

463
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:25,500
 And so when you find a man who's going to completely put your interest in front of his own and love you, lay down, compromise, sacrifice his life for your good.

464
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,500
 What's the only other appropriate response to that?

465
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:37,500
 And so if you, if I would tell you, if you have a, if you're having issues with submission, you're probably considering following the wrong leader.

466
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
 It may be you.

467
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
 It might be your issue.

468
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
 You may just have authority issues in general.

469
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
 You need to deal with that.

470
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
 Okay.

471
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 But if you're saying, if you're looking at a guy and you're like, man, I just don't think I can submit to this guy.

472
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,500
 He may not be worthy of you submitting to him in marriage.

473
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,500
 It also talks about mutual submission.

474
00:25:54,500 --> 00:26:08,500
 I do think that in that in the marriage, that that's what the picture that's being painted there is that as a husband loves his wife and puts her interest in front of his, that she would follow him.

475
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:16,500
 Jesus modeled this in Philippians 2, not not considering equality with God, equality with the father, something to be grasped.

476
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
 And they were not.

477
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
 There's a difference between roles and rank.

478
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
 Okay.

479
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,500
 So Jesus and the father play different roles, but they're equal in rank.

480
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,500
 Wives and husbands play different roles, but they're equal in rank.

481
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,500
 I think that's often lost in our culture.

482
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,500
 And so here's the quick answer to the question.

483
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,500
 What does it look like to submit?

484
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
 What does it look like to lead?

485
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
 It looks like to follow Jesus.

486
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:43,500
 If you women, if you ladies are following hard after Christ, you're going to crush this.

487
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,500
 Men, if you're following hard after Christ, you're going to crush this.

488
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
 I have no concerns for you.

489
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
 You're going to be a great leader.

490
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
 You're going to be a great wife one day.

491
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,500
 If you are following, if you are both following hard after Jesus, and I don't mean to sound like a broken record.

492
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
 It's just that important.

493
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
 It's awesome.

494
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,500
 Changing gears a little bit.

495
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,500
 This question came in and it's very much on the forefront of culture.

496
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,500
 And it was phrased like this.

497
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
 Why does God make people gay?

498
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,500
 And how should we as Christians respond to gay relationships around us?

499
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:24,500
 So I'm phrasing it, that is a quote in case, that's the exact quote.

500
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
 I better let you take this one.

501
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,500
 No, I'm just kidding.

502
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500
 Nice.

503
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,500
 I'm kidding.

504
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
 Why does God make people gay?

505
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,500
 He doesn't, except he's sovereign.

506
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
 And let's agree that's messy.

507
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,500
 And so let me just talk through this for a minute.

508
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:49,500
 And so if someone is molested in the fourth grade, and that causes them to question their sexual identity,

509
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:59,500
 and then they turn out to identify LGBT, did God make them gay?

510
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,500
 Right?

511
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
 And so we've got to consider those questions.

512
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,500
 And then we understand that we live in a fallen world.

513
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,500
 And so along with he doesn't, I would say because Genesis 3, so the world is fallen.

514
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,500
 And so people are born all kinds of ways.

515
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,500
 Right?

516
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
 All kinds of ways.

517
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:23,500
 You know, with -- I mean, and I'm not equating the two, and so I want to be careful.

518
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,500
 Because the sad thing is on a question like this, a lot of people lean in,

519
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,500
 and they're just waiting for you to say something that ticks them off.

520
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
 And I'm so put off by that.

521
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
 Because I love you.

522
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
 I love you.

523
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
 I'm glad you're here.

524
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
 You don't need to be so on edge.

525
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,500
 I'm not the enemy.

526
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,500
 God's not the enemy.

527
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,500
 He loves you.

528
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,500
 Listen.

529
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,500
 Lean in.

530
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,500
 Okay.

531
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,500
 And so people are born with Down syndrome.

532
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,500
 We could say why does God make people with trisomy 18, trisomy 13?

533
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
 Why do people die in the womb?

534
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
 Here's the reality.

535
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,500
 People are born all kinds of ways.

536
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
 Let me ask you this question.

537
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
 Why did God make me polyamorous?

538
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,500
 Why did God make me polygamous?

539
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,500
 Why did God make me in such a way that one woman would never satisfy me,

540
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,500
 meaning that even though I'm happily married to a beautiful woman,

541
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,500
 I still sin in the way that I lust after other women?

542
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,500
 Why did God make me that way?

543
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:20,500
 Because there are parts of my life that are not fully yielded to his spirit.

544
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:27,500
 And God's ideal was lost in Genesis chapter 3, but he sent his son to die for those sins.

545
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:33,500
 And so I'm committed not to following my desires, but following the Holy Spirit in that area,

546
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,500
 even if it means celibacy for the rest of my life.

547
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:44,500
 I'm committed to identifying what is God's ideal, what is God's first desire, pre-Genesis 3 desire,

548
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,500
 and how do I recreate that in my own heart and life?

549
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,500
 I think that's the way that I would answer that question.

550
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
 That's awesome.

551
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
 There's a message you did.

552
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
 Thank you for saying that.

553
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,500
 We have a couple more questions on this, and it's in our Lyrics and Lies series.

554
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,500
 If you haven't downloaded the Portrait app, do that or go to watermark.org/media.

555
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,500
 Lyrics and Lies series, I think it's called Same Love.

556
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
 Yes, Same Love. It's off Macklemore's Same Love.

557
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
 It's a response to Macklemore's Same Love.

558
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,500
 If you identify as LGBTQ or if you have a friend who does,

559
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,500
 I'd strongly encourage you to listen to that message, Same Love, in the Lyrics and Lies series.

560
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,500
 Also, Todd did one. You go to watermark.org.

561
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
 Just search homosexuality.

562
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,500
 It's an answer, response, and an apology, I believe.

563
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
 I'd encourage you to listen to that as well.

564
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
 Both are great.

565
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,500
 Then a response. How do we respond to gay relationships around us?

566
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
 Oh, man, it's a great question.

567
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,500
 I think it depends on if they're in the church or not.

568
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:45,500
 1 Corinthians 5, Paul says, "Am I to judge those outside the church,

569
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,500
 but I judge those inside the church?"

570
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,500
 If they say, "Hey, I'm a Christ follower,"

571
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,500
 and any struggle marks their lives, any sin marks their lives,

572
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:00,500
 like they identify as, it doesn't have to be gay, it can be any sin,

573
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
 then I'm going to speak truth to them and say,

574
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,500
 "Hey, I think that's different than what the Scripture says."

575
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,500
 But if they're not a follower of Jesus Christ,

576
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,500
 like they don't think the Bible is authoritative in their life,

577
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
 then I would share the gospel.

578
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,500
 I would say, "Hey, let me tell you that Christ loves you,

579
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,500
 that God is crazy about you, that He sent His Son to die for you

580
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,500
 in the same way that He died for me."

581
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,500
 And so here's what a lot of people just heard.

582
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,500
 "He just said gay was a sin."

583
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,500
 And so here's the deal. No, I didn't.

584
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,500
 The Scripture did. Okay?

585
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,500
 That's what the Scripture says. It's not a unique sin.

586
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
 It's not a sin different than my sin.

587
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,500
 It's not a special sin. It doesn't have a special consequence.

588
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,500
 But it is not God's ideal in the garden He created Adam and Eve.

589
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
 He created man and woman, male and female.

590
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,500
 He made the designs. He made their reproductive organs.

591
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,500
 He made them fit together the way they do so that they could produce life.

592
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,500
 And that's not an old idea. It's not old-fashioned.

593
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
 It's not oppressive. Right?

594
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,500
 If you're here and those are your struggles, I love you.

595
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,500
 We've had people on staff who have struggled with homosexuality.

596
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,500
 On staff here. We love them. We love you.

597
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
 Glad you're here. Glad you're listening.

598
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,500
 Love it. It's awesome.

599
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:20,500
 All right. What if I am dating someone and we've had sex

600
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,500
 but are now pursuing purity and a godly relationship together?

601
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,500
 Is our relationship doomed because of sin?

602
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,500
 Man, I hope not.

603
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,500
 I hope not and it may be. Okay?

604
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,500
 I hope not because that's my story.

605
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,500
 Monica and I definitely slept together before we married.

606
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,500
 We weren't Christians when we met.

607
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:50,500
 Just created a lot of disaster and collateral damage in our relationship

608
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
 that God had to work in.

609
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
 Then we trusted Christ.

610
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,500
 Then we were committed to celibacy until marriage.

611
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,500
 That was hard, right?

612
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,500
 Because we had already crossed that line.

613
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,500
 I would say my marriage is anything but doomed.

614
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,500
 Our marriage is an incredible place and very hopeful.

615
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,500
 Trending well.

616
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,500
 What are you doing? You're making me nervous.

617
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,500
 Come on out, Monica.

618
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
 That's not what she said earlier.

619
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,500
 I'm kidding. That's so wrong.

620
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,500
 Keep going.

621
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:31,500
 It may be doomed if you're not committed to receiving forgiveness.

622
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,500
 If you're not committed to setting appropriate boundaries.

623
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,500
 This is so important.

624
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,500
 We feel so entitled to that alone time.

625
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
 You're like, "Man, if I'm going to get to know someone,

626
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,500
 I've got to be alone with them, right?"

627
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,500
 No, not necessarily. Not at all.

628
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,500
 Not at all.

629
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
 You can get to know them in Starbucks.

630
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,500
 You can get to know them in bowling alleys.

631
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,500
 You can get to know them in public places.

632
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,500
 If you've crossed those relational boundaries,

633
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,500
 you need to strengthen the boundaries.

634
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,500
 Not because you're a legalist, but because Jesus said in Matthew 5,

635
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
 "If the eye causes you to sin, gouge it out.

636
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
 If the hand causes you to sin, cut it off."

637
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,500
 He's saying, "Hey, you need to put appropriate boundaries in place."

638
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
 Then receive forgiveness.

639
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
 Christ died for that sin.

640
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
 You're not doomed at all.

641
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,500
 Regardless of whether it's abortion,

642
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,500
 whether it's struggles we talked about already tonight,

643
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
 you're never doomed.

644
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
 The gospel is so full of hope.

645
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,500
 It talks about you becoming a new creation in Christ.

646
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,500
 It says that He's no longer counting your sins against you.

647
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,500
 It says in Romans 8, 1,

648
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,500
 "There's now no condemnation for those who are in Christ."

649
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,500
 Condemnation, that word translates consequence.

650
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,500
 You have no eternal consequence for the sins that you've committed

651
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
 when you trust in Jesus.

652
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,500
 How awesome is that?

653
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
 Here's one that came in.

654
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:49,500
 Probably the second most asked question was related to dating someone

655
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,500
 who maintains a friendship or some sort of communication with an ex-girlfriend

656
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,500
 or with other girls or vice versa, with an ex-boyfriend or with other boys.

657
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,500
 Can men and women be just friends?

658
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
 Should they?

659
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
 Friend-ation-ships?

660
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
 Question mark.

661
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,500
 That's deep, man.

662
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
 This is so--it's kind of bizarre, right?

663
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,500
 I mean, there's a lot of questions there.

664
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
 A ton, man.

665
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:24,500
 It was either one angry couple just like blowing it up, being like--

666
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,500
 And honestly, it was not the healthiest form of the questions.

667
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,500
 Like, hey, I'm talking to my ex-girlfriend a lot,

668
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,500
 but my girlfriend, I think she's just insecure and jealous.

669
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
 Can you fix this for me?

670
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
 And some variation--

671
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,500
 It's like somebody fighting for freedom and somebody fighting for us to help them.

672
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,500
 Yes, the other one--

673
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,500
 It's so crazy.

674
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,500
 Yeah, I don't--man, I can't even imagine being in a relationship with Monica

675
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,500
 or having a relationship with an ex.

676
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
 That sounds really unhealthy.

677
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
 You don't see that.

678
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,500
 Like in the Gospels, you don't see Jesus just like kicking it on a boat with Mary a lot.

679
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,500
 That's not--like they were just hanging out, just friends.

680
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,500
 I think God made men and women to come together to attract.

681
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:17,500
 Let me say something crazy, as if I haven't already.

682
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,500
 I think you could pretty much take any man and any woman,

683
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,500
 and if they were on a deserted island together and that's it,

684
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,500
 like life will happen.

685
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
 You tracking with me?

686
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,500
 Like we could talk about compatible or incompatible.

687
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,500
 You're not tracking with me?

688
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,500
 Let me double-click there for a second.

689
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,500
 I'm kidding. Bad joke. Keep going.

690
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,500
 You want diagrams?

691
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
 Yeah.

692
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:48,500
 And so man and woman were meant to come together.

693
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,500
 Like you were not meant to just be like hanging out with the opposite sex

694
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
 and protecting your heart.

695
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
 You just weren't meant for that.

696
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,500
 I know that flies in the face of culture.

697
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
 I get it. You can disagree.

698
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,500
 Feel complete and total freedom to disagree with me,

699
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
 but would you just consider it?

700
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
 And so like here's the deal.

701
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,500
 If you're texting your ex and your girlfriend's jealous--

702
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,500
 I don't know if she's jealous.

703
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,500
 She might just be wise.

704
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
 And yeah.

705
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,500
 [applause]

706
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,500
 And here's what I would tell you.

707
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,500
 If you're texting anyone like late at night a lot of the opposite sex,

708
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,500
 I would be careful because usually someone's heart is drifting.

709
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,500
 Like God made us to come together and be in relationship together

710
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
 so that life would spring forth.

711
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,500
 This is his brilliant genius design.

712
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,500
 And so he made us--he created these emotions in our heart

713
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,500
 that they would cross these lines and that they would go towards one another.

714
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
 And if you're like, "Well, that ain't happening for me,"

715
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
 it's probably happening for them.

716
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
 And you may be a stumbling block.

717
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,500
 Just be careful in that, okay?

718
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,500
 And you're constantly playing that game.

719
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,500
 "I wonder what he meant by that.

720
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
 I wonder what she meant by that."

721
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,500
 You know, that text at 11.30 p.m., right?

722
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
 "I wonder what he meant by that."

723
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
 And he says, "Are you sleeping yet?"

724
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,500
 "I wonder what he meant by that."

725
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
 "He meant, 'Are you sleeping?'"

726
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,500
 That's good.

727
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,500
 This one came in from online.

728
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,500
 "Is masturbation a sin?"

729
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
 "Is masturbation a sin?"

730
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,500
 That was a curveball.

731
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,500
 I wasn't ready for that.

732
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,500
 Yeah, dude.

733
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,500
 Took that left turn, man.

734
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,500
 Yeah, let me set up the arguments, the strawman arguments,

735
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
 because people will come and say, "Well, lust is a sin.

736
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,500
 What if I can do it without lust?"

737
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,500
 Let me say this.

738
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,500
 You're not meant to do it without lust.

739
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,500
 Does that make--and what I mean by lust is you're not meant to do that

740
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,500
 devoid of the thought of the opposite sex.

741
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
 Like, that was never God's intention.

742
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,500
 Like, God's intention was his incredible design,

743
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
 so that when you experience release,

744
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,500
 that you're actually fertilizing something

745
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
 and that life is being brought forth.

746
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
 I know that's crazy.

747
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
 Let me say this even--let me go even crazier,

748
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,500
 because I get to say this in the series, and I believe this.

749
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,500
 Like, we think--you think about what is the purpose of sex.

750
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,500
 And when I say sex, I mean the act, sexual intercourse,

751
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,500
 between a man and a woman.

752
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,500
 What is the purpose of it?

753
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,500
 There's two purposes of sex, biblically speaking.

754
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,500
 There's the bonding that happens,

755
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,500
 that is now scientifically proven that it happens,

756
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
 that when we experience orgasm,

757
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,500
 our five senses bond to our surroundings.

758
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,500
 And there's all kinds of sexual dysfunction

759
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
 that's created out of this science

760
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
 that God tells us in Genesis 2,

761
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,500
 "For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother

762
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
 and be united to his wife,

763
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
 and the two will become one flesh."

764
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,500
 And so sex, the first purpose is the purpose of bonding.

765
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,500
 The second purpose of sex is--

766
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,500
 sexual intercourse is for procreation,

767
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
 that life will be born.

768
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
 This is God's genius design.

769
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,500
 Sex was God's idea.

770
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,500
 Make no mistake about it.

771
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,500
 It's not gross. It's not weird.

772
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
 It is--God was the genius.

773
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,500
 He was the Steve Jobs behind the iPhone.

774
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,500
 He was the Steve Jobs behind sex.

775
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,500
 That was God.

776
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,500
 He said, "I'm gonna make those parts work the way they do, okay?

777
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
 This one function the way it does. That one fits there."

778
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
 It's his--don't think about it too long.

779
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,500
 It's his genius design.

780
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,500
 I'm serious.

781
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,500
 And I'm not just trying to be slap-knee funny right now.

782
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:15,500
 I'm just--it is genius that is God's design.

783
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,500
 So think about what we do for a minute.

784
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,500
 What we try to do is we try to capture the act

785
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
 away from the purpose.

786
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,500
 You say, "Well, wait a minute, JP.

787
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,500
 There's a third reason, right?"

788
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,500
 Pleasure.

789
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,500
 God made sex for pleasure.

790
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

791
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,500
 The pleasure serves a purpose.

792
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,500
 That's the bonding agent is the pleasure.

793
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,500
 That's--like if sex felt like a spinal tap,

794
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,500
 I think that we would stop doing it

795
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,500
 and life would cease as we know it.

796
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,500
 And so God, because he wanted us to cover the earth,

797
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,500
 made it feel good, and it serves the purpose

798
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,500
 of both procreation and the bonding.

799
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,500
 That's the genius of God's design, right?

800
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,500
 And so what we try to do is we try to capture

801
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,500
 the pleasure away from the purpose.

802
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
 Well, I don't want her to get pregnant.

803
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
 And I don't even really want to be stuck to them,

804
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,500
 if you will.

805
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,500
 I want to have a one-night stand without any recourse.

806
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
 Guess what? You can.

807
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,500
 It's theologically, physically, biologically,

808
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,500
 scientifically impossible to do that

809
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,500
 without any recourse. You can't.

810
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,500
 And so when you start to think, say,

811
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
 "Hey, I'm going to masturbate, but I'm just going to think

812
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,500
 "Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper."

813
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,500
 You can't. You're bonding to Dr. Pepper.

814
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,500
 I would not do that. I wouldn't do it.

815
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,500
 I would not do that.

816
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,500
 And so you say, "Well, support that scripturally."

817
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,500
 People have said all kinds of crazy things.

818
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
 Onan's built a seed.

819
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,500
 Here's what I tell you. I think it's interesting.

820
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
 And just consider this.

821
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,500
 This is JP speaking.

822
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,500
 I'd step away from the pulpit if I was behind one.

823
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,500
 Just consider this. Let's put this in the opinion category.

824
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
 I think it's interesting that Jesus says,

825
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,500
 "If your hand causes you to sin regarding lust."

826
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,500
 I think it's interesting that he goes there.

827
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,500
 So you research that on your own.

828
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,500
 But he goes, "I," and then he goes, "hand."

829
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,500
 And I find that interesting. Matthew 5 is the reference.

830
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,500
 - Love it. All right.

831
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,500
 We're going to do what's called the lightning round.

832
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,500
 - We haven't been doing lightning round?

833
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,500
 - No. - One of us has.

834
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,500
 I'm going to rapid-fire some questions at you.

835
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,500
 And then, yeah, here we go.

836
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,500
 All right. Should a single mother reconcile with her child's father

837
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,500
 even if they were never married?

838
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,500
 - Mind-blown.

839
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,500
 What do you mean by reconcile?

840
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,500
 Like forgive? Like make amends?

841
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,500
 Yes. Be married because you have a child?

842
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,500
 No. I mean, it's great.

843
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,500
 Absolutely not.

844
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,500
 Be reconciled. Get married just because you have a kid together.

845
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
 Be together. Stay together.

846
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
 Because we have a kid together, we have to stay together.

847
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,500
 No. No.

848
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,500
 If there was no marriage,

849
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,500
 I don't think reconciliation plays a role necessarily.

850
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,500
 Community, man.

851
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,500
 There's a lot of individual case bases out there that I may not be aware of,

852
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,500
 but I would make sure you have wise people around you.

853
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,500
 - It doesn't rule them out as a spouse or rule them in.

854
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
 - That's exactly--it's a great way to say it.

855
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,500
 Lightning round. Well done.

856
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,500
 - The person I'm dating is a godly man

857
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,500
 but of a different race.

858
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
 Our families do not like this.

859
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,500
 How do we honor our parents here? Break up?

860
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,500
 - How do you honor your family?

861
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,500
 I would say potentially you don't honor--

862
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,500
 here's how you honor your parents.

863
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,500
 It sounds like they have a value that's different than what God values.

864
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,500
 And so you would go to them and you would say--

865
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,500
 [applause]

866
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,500
 If they're Christians, you would say,

867
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,500
 "Hey, help me understand this value biblically."

868
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
 And if they're not Christians,

869
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,500
 then I would share the gospel and I would go Genesis 2, 24, I believe.

870
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,500
 "It is for this reason that I have to leave my father and mother

871
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,500
 and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."

872
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:04,500
 That's assuming that they love Jesus.

873
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,500
 And so somebody asked me like this,

874
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,500
 "Hey, would you have a problem if Presley's--

875
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,500
 my daughter, that's my daughter--

876
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,500
 married a black guy?

877
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,500
 Would you care?"

878
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,500
 I mean, does he love Jesus?

879
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,500
 If he loves Jesus, absolutely not.

880
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,500
 I would not care.

881
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,500
 I would celebrate that.

882
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,500
 I wouldn't even consider it for a second.

883
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,500
 And so--

884
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,500
 - That's great. I love it.

885
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,500
 So the way you honor your parents is go talk to them,

886
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,500
 either share the gospel, or if they claim to be Christians,

887
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,500
 say, "Hey, this is--you're holding a non-biblical value."

888
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,500
 - It's like, how do I honor my parents if they don't want me to go to church?

889
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,500
 And I would just say if you're an adult,

890
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,500
 you honor them by saying, "Hey, this is what I need to do.

891
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,500
 I need to go to church. I need to be a part of Christ's body."

892
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,500
 - If two people are pursuing God and in a dating relationship,

893
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,500
 but they disagree theologically,

894
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,500
 would they be considered unequally yoked?

895
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,500
 For example, they don't agree regarding spiritual gifts

896
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,500
 or Calvinism, which is like a school of thought.

897
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,500
 - Calvinism. Woo!

898
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,500
 - Thank you. Our Calvinist section over here.

899
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,500
 - Okay.

900
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,500
 I would be cautious.

901
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,500
 2 Corinthians 6, 14, unequally yoked passage,

902
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,500
 talks about light and darkness, good and evil.

903
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,500
 I don't think it's talking about just, like,

904
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,500
 nuanced theological differences.

905
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,500
 If you're both running hard after Jesus,

906
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,500
 you believe in Christology, the gospel, the essence,

907
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,500
 that we are saved by grace through faith,

908
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
 faith alone.

909
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,500
 I don't think it matters if you are more in an Arminian camp,

910
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,500
 they're more in a Calvinist camp.

911
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,500
 But if you believe, "Hey, I'm saved by Jesus plus something else,"

912
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,500
 that could be problematic. That is problematic.

913
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,500
 - Okay. Christians and Catholics.

914
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,500
 I think it's the same answer.

915
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,500
 - That's a great question. Yeah.

916
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,500
 I would just say, depends on what you mean by Catholic.

917
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,500
 And if they're committed to grace through the sacraments,

918
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,500
 then that would be--

919
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,500
 and I say this as a Catholic for 20-something years--

920
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,500
 that would be Jesus plus something else.

921
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,500
 You would need to lean into that and understand what that believes.

922
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,500
 A lot of people don't know what they believe.

923
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,500
 Protestant, Catholic, doesn't even mean anything to them.

924
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,500
 It's like, "Hey, what do you believe about Jesus?

925
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,500
 "How do you believe we're saved?

926
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,500
 "How do you believe we're going to get to God?"

927
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,500
 You're going to email me on that one,

928
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,500
 because I know that always stirs up some anger.

929
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,500
 And so you're welcome to.

930
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,500
 Or email David, D-Y.

931
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,500
 But just consider what I'm saying.

932
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,500
 GotQuestions.org is a great resource, guys.

933
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,500
 GotQuestions.org. I strongly recommend it.

934
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,500
 - That's awesome.

935
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,500
 Can a girl ask out a guy?

936
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,500
 - Sure. - All right.

937
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,500
 - I mean, here's the deal.

938
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,500
 Remember that whole choosing your problems thing?

939
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
 You're choosing your problems.

940
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,500
 And so if you ask out a guy,

941
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,500
 you're going to way increase your chances

942
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,500
 of getting a really passive guy

943
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,500
 that he didn't even take the initiative to ask you out.

944
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,500
 And the other thing I would say, ladies--

945
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,500
 this doesn't get me voted most popular--

946
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,500
 but you may have a control issue if you want to,

947
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,500
 and you need to double-check.

948
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,500
 Oh, see, there's the roar of the crowd.

949
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,500
 Calm down.

950
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
 [laughter]

951
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,500
 Don't self-identify like that.

952
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,500
 So, no, test it. Test it.

953
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,500
 Okay, hear me out.

954
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,500
 Just ask yourself, "Do I need to be in control?"

955
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,500
 In Genesis 3, it says that her desire was for her husband,

956
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,500
 which we know that desire there is--

957
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,500
 she desired to rule over her husband.

958
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,500
 And so, ladies, that is the struggle

959
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,500
 that was born in the fall,

960
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,500
 and one that you will have to continually check

961
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,500
 for the rest of your life.

962
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,500
 That's awesome. Okay, three more.

963
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,500
 "What are the ways that a woman can let--"

964
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,500
 This one's from @port_to_instagram.

965
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,500
 This is, "What are the ways that a woman

966
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,500
 "can let a man know she is interested?"

967
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,500
 This question came in several different times

968
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,500
 in several different mediums.

969
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,500
 Just similar to the last one.

970
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
 I mean, you could say, "I'm interested."

971
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,500
 [laughter]

972
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,500
 You know, I'd just--I'd be wise.

973
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,500
 I love it. Okay, this one,

974
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,500
 Emily is saying has come in a ton tonight,

975
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,500
 and it came in a ton throughout the week,

976
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,500
 which is, "Is it okay for couples to spend the night together

977
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,500
 "without having sex?"

978
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,500
 Cohabitation we've talked about.

979
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,500
 So if that's not okay, what about just sleepovers?

980
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,500
 A guy staying over at a girl, that was a question.

981
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:28,500
 And so she's sent it to me, like, three different times,

982
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,500
 saying, "Make sure you hit the sleepover question."

983
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,500
 Getting tons also hit the living together in that question.

984
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,500
 Yeah.

985
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,500
 Um, no, it's not okay if you stay with someone

986
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,500
 who obviously has sex

987
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,500
 with the intentions of not having sex.

988
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,500
 I would say you weren't meant to.

989
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,500
 Again, that's not God's design,

990
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,500
 and you're training yourself for something different.

991
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,500
 Like, I've had lots of cohabitation conversations.

992
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,500
 I just want to remind you the success rate

993
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,500
 of couples who cohabitate are 10 out of 100

994
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,500
 get married and stay married.

995
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,500
 10 out of 100, you see wisdom in God's design.

996
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,500
 We love you, and he loves you,

997
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,500
 and so he gives you instruction.

998
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,500
 1 Thessalonians 5 talks about fleeing the appearance of evil.

999
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,500
 1 Corinthians 6 talks about flee--

1000
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,500
 1 Corinthians 6, 18, flee sexual immorality.

1001
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,500
 "For do you not know your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit

1002
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,500
 "who is in you, whom you have received from God?

1003
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,500
 "You are not your own, you are bought at a price.

1004
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,500
 "You are not your own, you are bought at a price.

1005
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,500
 "You are not your own, you are bought at a price.

1006
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,500
 "You are not your own, you are bought at a price."

1007
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1008
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1009
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1010
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1011
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1012
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1013
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1014
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1015
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1016
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1017
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1018
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1019
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1020
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1021
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1022
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1023
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1024
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1025
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1026
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1027
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1028
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1029
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1030
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1031
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1032
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1033
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1034
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1035
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1036
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1037
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1038
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1039
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1040
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1041
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1042
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1043
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1044
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1045
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,500
 You're not your own, you're bought at a price.

1046
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,500
 And we'll just end here.

1047
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,500
 It's a great place to end.

1048
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,500
 I think I can loop in all of those questions in one.

1049
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,500
 I've showed you before,

1050
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,500
 like if I had a Bible,

1051
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,500
 and I had a Bible,

1052
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,500
 and I showed you everything it said about relationships,

1053
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,500
 everything it said about dating and marriage,

1054
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,500
 and male/female relationships,

1055
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,500
 it'd be really thin.

1056
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,500
 I mean, you talk about a couple pages

1057
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,500
 in light of 66 books,

1058
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,500
 a couple pages.

1059
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,500
 And it's because that book,

1060
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,500
 this instruction that Creator God gave us,

1061
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,500
 is about another relationship.

1062
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,500
 And I know where you're at right now

1063
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,500
 in this season of life.

1064
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,500
 It feels like attention,

1065
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,500
 attraction, and pursuit of the opposite sex

1066
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,500
 seems ultimate.

1067
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,500
 And I want you to know it's not.

1068
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,500
 And you're going to know that I'm right.

1069
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,500
 I can say that with all authority and credibility

1070
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,500
 because every single person in this room

1071
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,500
 is going to look back on this night,

1072
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,500
 if you don't right now,

1073
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,500
 and say, "You're absolutely right."

1074
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,500
 No one's ever come back and said,

1075
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,500
 "You were wrong. This was ultimate."

1076
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,500
 No one's ever got to heaven and said,

1077
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,500
 "God, why did you withhold marriage from me?"

1078
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,500
 Because heaven is all about another marriage.

1079
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,500
 It's you to Jesus.

1080
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,500
 And so your life,

1081
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:04,500
 Matthew 6, verse 33,

1082
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,500
 says, "Seek first His kingdom

1083
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,500
 and His righteousness,

1084
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,500
 and all these other things will be added."

1085
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
 And it's in a chapter about worry and anxieties.

1086
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,500
 Don't worry and be anxious

1087
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,500
 about all of these things.

1088
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,500
 Concern yourself fully

1089
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,500
 with the pursuit of God's Son,

1090
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,500
 Jesus Christ.

1091
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,500
 And God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth,

1092
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,500
 who controls all things and loves you,

1093
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,500
 will take care of the rest.

1094
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,500
 And so I told you, man, last weekend,

1095
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,500
 we celebrated

1096
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,500
 12 years

1097
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,500
 of that. 12 years of pursuing

1098
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,500
 Christ together.

1099
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,500
 After three years, we dated for three years

1100
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,500
 just so there's no secrets here. We dated for three years.

1101
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,500
 For three years,

1102
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,500
 it was manic highs

1103
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,500
 and manic lows. I love you. I hate you.

1104
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,500
 I was unfaithful.

1105
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,500
 In those three years, I was a terrible person.

1106
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,500
 I was addicted to pornography.

1107
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,500
 I had sexual addiction. I was an alcoholic.

1108
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,500
 And so

1109
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,500
 there was so much to recover from.

1110
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,500
 But when Christ came in my life,

1111
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,500
 and I went fully in with Jesus,

1112
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,500
 seeking first His kingdom,

1113
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,500
 He began to fix those things.

1114
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,500
 And she and I began to pursue Him together

1115
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,500
 radically.

1116
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,500
 And it fixed us. The Holy Spirit

1117
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,500
 comes into our marriage

1118
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,500
 and begins to repair the damage that I

1119
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,500
 had caused. And it's been

1120
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,500
 awesome. And so whether you're

1121
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,500
 healing from a breakup and you're inviting

1122
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,500
 community's help into that,

1123
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,500
 because we bear one another's burdens,

1124
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,500
 and I know that heartbreak hurts.

1125
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,500
 Let me say this, okay?

1126
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,500
 And we'll end with this.

1127
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,500
 Band, if y'all want to come up, you're welcome to.

1128
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,500
 Um,

1129
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,500
 I've got two

1130
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,500
 little girls, seven and nine.

1131
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,500
 If you

1132
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,500
 at any point between

1133
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,500
 the past nine years have gone in their room,

1134
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,500
 what you're going to see, I want you to know,

1135
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,500
 it looks like Disney Princess

1136
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,500
 has exploded, okay,

1137
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,500
 in their room. I mean,

1138
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,500
 on the walls, on their pajamas,

1139
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,500
 there's dolls, there's

1140
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,500
 all kinds

1141
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,500
 of figurines and books.

1142
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,500
 Everything around this

1143
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,500
 idea of princess.

1144
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,500
 It's been fed to them so

1145
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,500
 early on. My seven-year-old,

1146
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,500
 I was going to take her to a birthday party, and she had two friends

1147
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,500
 in the back. And they knew every word

1148
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,500
 to every Adele song that came on the radio.

1149
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,500
 Bieber comes on the radio, they start

1150
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,500
 singing, you know? And then that

1151
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,500
 Chainsmokers song, you know that song?

1152
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,500
 You guys know that one? About the mattress

1153
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,500
 and biting the tattoo on the shoulder

1154
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,500
 and roommate in Boulder, that one.

1155
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,500
 Um, they start singing

1156
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,500
 the words of that song. And I just

1157
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,500
 turned down the radio, I muted it, and I said, "What's that about?"

1158
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,500
 Fellow seven-year-olds.

1159
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,500
 [laughter]

1160
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,500
 And they're like, "Oh, you know, I think

1161
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,500
 she's in love with a boy."

1162
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,500
 And then Bieber's like,

1163
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,500
 "Oh, I think that she's in love." And then Adele,

1164
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,500
 "I think she wrote her boyfriend a letter

1165
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,500
 and she sent it to him,

1166
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,500
 but she hopes he never gets it."

1167
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,500
 And I was just like, "Why are all these

1168
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,500
 songs about love?" And I just

1169
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,500
 began to think about, since they were seven-year-old,

1170
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,500
 seven years old, they were fed this message.

1171
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,500
 And men were fed a message, too.

1172
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,500
 It's that the prince is going to come in and slay

1173
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,500
 the dragon and we're going to be conquerors.

1174
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,500
 And ladies, honestly,

1175
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,500
 we've been told by culture we need to conquer you.

1176
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,500
 Which is really

1177
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,500
 the opposite of what you want.

1178
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,500
 Right? You want someone to be

1179
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,500
 gentle and caring

1180
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,500
 and kind and compassionate

1181
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,500
 and to lay their life down

1182
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,500
 like Christ loved the church.

1183
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,500
 And so guys, man, here's what I want you to know

1184
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,500
 and you've got to hear me on this.

1185
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,500
 You've just got to hear my heart.

1186
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,500
 Your worldview,

1187
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,500
 if it's anything

1188
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,500
 outside of a biblical worldview,

1189
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,500
 it's really, really

1190
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,500
 messed up.

1191
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,500
 It's really jacked up.

1192
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,500
 And you've got to take some time

1193
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,500
 and create some space

1194
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,500
 and get some believers in the room.

1195
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,500
 And you've got to pray, and I want you to beg

1196
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,500
 God, Father in Heaven,

1197
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,500
 would you fix my heart? Would you fix

1198
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,500
 my worldview? Would you remove

1199
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,500
 the things in my heart and mind that have been

1200
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,500
 fed to me by culture?

1201
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,500
 That are setting me up for a divorce, for three marriages,

1202
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,500
 for lots of heartbreak?

1203
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,500
 And would you begin

1204
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,500
 to inform me with the Scriptures?

1205
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,500
 Would you write the Scriptures on my heart?

1206
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,500
 Allow me to guard my heart, understanding

1207
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,500
 that everything in my life flows from it.

1208
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,500
 Would you become

1209
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,500
 the greatest obsession in my life?

1210
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,500
 Jesus.

1211
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,500
 Would you become more worthy than everything

1212
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,500
 else? Jesus, would you

1213
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,500
 make me madly, truly,

1214
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,500
 deeply in love? Take a strong

1215
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,500
 man, a bowed-up,

1216
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,500
 you know, courageous individual,

1217
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,500
 and

1218
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,500
 compromise him.

1219
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,500
 That he would be broken

1220
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,500
 before the cross.

1221
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,500
 And say, "God, I want you to lead

1222
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,500
 my life."

1223
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,500
 Take a woman who's

1224
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,500
 terrified that a man's

1225
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,500
 going to hurt her, and so she's

1226
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,500
 hard and calloused and

1227
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,500
 bowed up, and it's like, "You ain't going to hurt me."

1228
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,500
 And Jesus,

1229
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,500
 break her.

1230
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,500
 Bring her to the end of herself.

1231
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,500
 Make something gentle

1232
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,500
 there, something

1233
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,500
 sweet, something

1234
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,500
 kind, something

1235
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,500
 loving.

1236
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,500
 And friends, imagine if he did that

1237
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,500
 in Houston and Fort

1238
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,500
 Worth and here in

1239
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,500
 Dallas and all over the world.

1240
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,500
 My prayer is that

1241
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,500
 everyone here tonight would be married once

1242
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,500
 and forever.

1243
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,500
 How awesome is that? For a lifetime.

1244
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,500
 The truth is,

1245
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,500
 all

1246
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,500
 of you are going to get a divorce.

1247
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,500
 I don't mean

1248
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,500
 specifically you, like you said on this side of the room, but

1249
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,500
 statistically,

1250
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,500
 that's what's going to

1251
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,500
 happen. And the reason we do this

1252
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,500
 is because we don't

1253
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,500
 want that to happen. I want you to find a greater

1254
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,500
 person than Jesus Christ.

1255
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,500
 And it's absolutely possible.

1256
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,500
 There has never, ever been

1257
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,500
 a broken marriage between two people

1258
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,500
 radically pursuing Christ. It's never

1259
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,500
 happened in the history of history.

1260
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,500
 It's never happened.

1261
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,500
 So let me pray, and

1262
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,500
 we'll go to worship.

1263
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,500
 Jesus, would you become our greatest

1264
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,500
 obsession?

1265
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,500
 Thank you for these questions. Thank you for the hearts of my

1266
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,500
 friend. Thank you for David, just his

1267
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,500
 wisdom and ability to

1268
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,500
 ask things in a succinct way.

1269
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,500
 Thank you for

1270
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,500
 the shames that you sing love

1271
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,500
 songs through.

1272
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,500
 All the incredible examples of

1273
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,500
 marriage around us,

1274
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,500
 whether it's

1275
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,500
 Bea and Beth, or Ian and Kelly, or David and

1276
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,500
 Callie, or Allie and Ryan,

1277
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,500
 or Chad and Emily, and so forth and so on.

1278
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,500
 Just so many incredible marriages

1279
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,500
 around us, Lord. Help us to

1280
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,500
 learn.

1281
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,500
 Instruct our hearts through

1282
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,500
 your word and your Holy Spirit

1283
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,500
 and those who have done this well.

1284
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:54,500
 And Father, thank you that your word never returns

1285
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,500
 void.

1286
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,500
 Would you correct us tonight as we sing

1287
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,500
 this song? Would you just change us?

1288
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,500
 We love you. In Christ's name,

1289
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,500
 amen. Amen.

1290
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,500
 Guys, thanks for hanging in with us.

1291
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,500
 I know we went long tonight.

1292
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,500
 So amazing to worship.

1293
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,500
 Just the

1294
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,500
 God, the creator of the heavens and the earth.

1295
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,500
 I'll say one thing just to clean up

1296
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,500
 something I said as I was sitting there and just

1297
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,500
 feel like the Lord put this on my heart.

1298
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,500
 I think I said earlier that being

1299
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,500
 gay is a sin.

1300
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,500
 Being gay is not a sin. Acting

1301
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,500
 out on any desire that is

1302
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,500
 inconsistent with God's desire

1303
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,500
 is a sin. And I'll say this, too.

1304
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,500
 Being identified by your sexuality,

1305
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,500
 finding identity in anything,

1306
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,500
 be it a

1307
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,500
 skin color or

1308
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,500
 sexual orientation or a neighborhood

1309
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,500
 you live in. When you say, "Hey, this is the biggest

1310
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,500
 thing about me," if I walked around and said, "I'm Kish,"

1311
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,500
 or whatever, right?

1312
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,500
 If I find identity in anything

1313
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,500
 first and foremost beyond my relationship

1314
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,500
 with Christ or other than my relationship

1315
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,500
 with Christ, then I'm outside of

1316
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,500
 God's first desire for my life.

1317
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,500
 That's what I'm trying to say is that this whole

1318
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,500
 idea is about another

1319
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,500
 relationship. We're all going to

1320
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,500
 realize that one day.

1321
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,500
 So, I want you guys to thank

1322
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,500
 my friend David Marvin for filling the questions tonight.

1323
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,500
 [applause]

1324
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,500
 [laughter]

1325
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,500
 Hey, we had 300 questions that came in.

1326
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,500
 Over 300. We will answer as many of them

1327
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,500
 as possible tomorrow during

1328
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,500
 a Facebook Live session at 1130.

1329
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,500
 Make sure you check us out at facebook.com/supportsdallas.

1330
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,500
 1130 tomorrow. A few things

1331
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,500
 we want to make sure you guys know about tonight of

1332
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,500
 opportunities that you don't want to miss out on.

1333
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,500
 [laughter]

1334
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,500
 Everything okay?

1335
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,500
 [laughter]

1336
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,500
 Hey, if you're not in a community group, tonight

1337
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,500
 is your night. If you're dating

1338
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,500
 someone, you're in a relationship, you're single, wherever you are

1339
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,500
 across the board, tonight is a chance for you to get

1340
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,500
 involved in community. And if you're a guy,

1341
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,500
 you can go right down this hallway into what we call open

1342
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,500
 community group. If you're a girl, you can go right down this

1343
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,500
 hallway, get involved in open community group.

1344
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,500
 Tonight, we have a group

1345
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,500
 of friends and partners

1346
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,500
 in this city. We are trying to reach this city that are

1347
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,500
 going to be hanging out with us tonight in the lobby.

1348
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,500
 We want you guys, if you don't have a

1349
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,500
 place where you are serving and using your gifts

1350
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,500
 and you're a Christian,

1351
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,500
 to go stop by our friends and say,

1352
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,500
 "Hey, how can I serve? What do you guys do to

1353
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,500
 reach the city?" They're going to be here

1354
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,500
 to talk and meet with you. Also,

1355
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,500
 voter registration is available

1356
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,500
 out there. We believe that as Christians

1357
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,500
 in a democracy, we have a

1358
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,500
 responsibility and an opportunity

1359
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,500
 to influence legislation and

1360
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,500
 culture around us in a way that many in our world

1361
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,500
 and many in history have not. Because

1362
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,500
 we're in a democracy, we have Christians, and

1363
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,500
 we have been afforded an opportunity. We think that

1364
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,500
 you need to take advantage of it. We think we have a

1365
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,500
 responsibility as followers of Christ to do that. So, if you're not

1366
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,500
 registered to vote tonight, you can do that

1367
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,500
 outside in the lobby. Also, if you're

1368
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,500
 in college, on the second floor

1369
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,500
 in what we call Stage 2, which is just

1370
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,500
 right up by the tree fort on the second floor,

1371
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,500
 our college team is going to be hanging out.

1372
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,500
 You don't want to miss. We're going to be here

1373
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,500
 just gathering, connecting. So,

1374
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,500
 come hang out with us there. Anything else

1375
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,500
 you remember? Anything else? I don't think so.

1376
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,500
 That's it.

1377
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,500
 Hey, guys. If you...we can pray

1378
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,500
 for you. If you want to talk to anybody, find somebody with a light

1379
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,500
 bulb on their shirt. It says, "The Porch."

1380
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,500
 Go in peace, to love, and serve

1381
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,500
 the Lord.
