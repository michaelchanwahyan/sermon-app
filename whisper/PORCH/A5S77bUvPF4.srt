00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Let's go, Porsche, come on!

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 [Cheers]

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Man, it's so great to be back with you guys.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I love this place. You need to know that. I love this place.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 We don't know each other. I used to hang out here for a long time.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 And I love the people here. I love Kyle.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I'm so thankful for his leadership and the way that God is using him.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 And those aren't just platitudes. As I sit there and I worship, I'm just like,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 "Holy Spirit, you are moving in this place."

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 He was so kind to say that you're going to get to hear from me.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 But my prayer is really, literally, today that you would hear from God.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Not my words, but the Holy Spirit would intersect with those words and change lives.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 And some of you, you're like, "Oh, man, I didn't even know where I was coming to.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 A friend invited me to the porch. I thought I was going to a restaurant."

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 And here we are. And so I'm glad you're here.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 No drink specials tonight, but we have the water that will make you never thirst again.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 I'll show you something I brought with me tonight.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 And so this here is $100 bills.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And so you can kind of see that, right? I don't know.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I figured I would give it to somebody.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 And so, yeah, a couple of hands.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Okay, I'm going to do that. Before I do, before we give it away,

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 I've got to tell you the story behind it.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 People have different hobbies.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 My biggest hobby is Facebook Marketplace, okay?

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I buy and sell. I know, there's like me and you.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 I buy and sell stuff on Facebook Marketplace.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 And so I had this motorcycle for sale, and this guy DMs me and says,

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 "By the way, it's 1130 at night, almost midnight."

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And he DMs me. My phone, I'm up. My phone makes that noise.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 I'm like, "Oh, I got a DM."

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And he goes, "Hey, I want to see your bike right now."

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And I was like, "Hey, that's not happening."

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And then he responds with some curse words.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 So I was like, "No big deal, buddy. You're not going to happen."

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Well, the next day I'm going on a date with Monica, my wife,

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 and we're on our way to this restaurant.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 We actually pull up to the restaurant, and my phone makes that noise.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I get a DM. And I look at it. He goes, "Yo, I'm at your house."

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Which is confusing because he didn't have my address.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 So I'm like, "How did he get to my house?"

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And I'm kind of panicking because the kids are there by themselves.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 I'm like, "What do I do?" And I look at Monica, and I'm like, "Okay."

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 I'm trying to figure out how I tell her the back story of what's going on.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And then right then, my neighbor calls me.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 My phone rings, and it's my neighbor, Tyler.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Tyler's who you want to have as a neighbor.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 He runs marathons for fun with guns.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 No joke. I don't know what it is, but you run a marathon, and you shoot stuff.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 That's what he does for fun. That's my neighbor. He always knows what's going on.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 So he calls me, and he says, "Hey, you know somebody's on your lawn?"

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 He's always watching, right? And I go, "Yeah, Tyler, man. Here's what's going on."

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And I kind of catch him up. I'm like, "I got this motorcycle for sale.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 This dude DMs me." And now he just shows up.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 I don't even know how he got my address. And Tyler, he's like, "Yo, I got you."

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 And I'm like, "What do you mean?" He goes, "The bike's in the garage?"

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 And I'm like, "Yeah." He goes, "I'll show it to him. If he wants to buy it, I'll take the cash.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 If he doesn't, I'll send him on his way."

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I was like, "Yo, Tyler, man. Love your neighbor as yourself, you know? That's what's up."

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And so then Monica and I, we're at the restaurant now, this Italian place,

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 and we got the Ring Cam, you know?

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And so we just pull up the Ring Cam, and we're being entertained as we sit there,

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 you know, ordering spaghetti.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And I see the guy there. He's got a perfect view.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I see Tyler go get my motorcycle out of the garage.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 I see him walk it out to the street to the back of this guy's truck.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And then they're out there for a long time. It kind of stalls for a minute.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Like, "What's going on? He doesn't like the bike. I don't know."

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 You know, he's looking at it. And no, I see him hand Tyler some money, right?

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And then, again, it just stalls. It's taking way too long.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 "What's going on?" You know, we're just watching, right?

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 And then I see Tyler walk the bike back to the garage.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And then he calls me again. He goes, "Hey, did you see that?"

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 I was like, "How'd you know?"

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 And I go, "Yeah, what happened?"

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 "I saw you bring out the bike, and then I saw you put it back.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 I saw him give you money." I go, "What happened?"

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 This is what he said, okay?

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 He goes, "Fake bills."

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I go, "What do you mean?"

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 He goes, "He was trying to buy your motorcycle with fake money."

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And I was like, "Well, how did you know?"

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Because I'm like, "Would I have sold it to him? I probably would have been like,

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 'Thanks, man. Here's the bike. Thank God for Tyler.'"

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 He goes, "Well, I just held it up to the light.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 It felt funny to me. I held it up to the light,

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 and I realized it didn't have all the markings that it was supposed to have.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 It wasn't authentic. It wasn't real."

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And so, you know, what you need to know about this

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 is I bought it for $12 on Timu.

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 You know? Right?

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And the reason I start there is because, like, you're at church on Tuesday night.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Okay? You're singing some song.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 ♪ Battle belongs to... ♪

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 ♪ I fight on my knees... ♪

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 ♪ Hands raised, hands lifted high. Oh, God. ♪

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Right?

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Surely you're a real-deal Christian.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And what I learned doing ministry here for a long time

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 is that there's people that memorize scriptures.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 They got Icthus tattoos on their ankles,

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Philippians 4.13 on their letter jackets.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 You know?

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And they--all the things--

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 But, like, you look at last night or last week

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 or your search history,

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 okay, the hashtags you click on,

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 your TikTok algorithms,

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 and you're like, "Wait a minute.

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I don't know that Jesus is actually reigning in my life."

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 And I'm not trying to scare you, okay?

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 This is not--this is not a fear tactic.

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I just get compensated to tell you the truth.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And I want you to know there's a real danger

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 to you going out there saying,

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 "Hey, I'm the real-deal Christ follower,"

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 but you not being the real-deal Christ follower

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 because you have an enemy, and he hates you.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 I studied--I spent the last three years

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 studying spiritual warfare,

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 everything the Bible has to say about Satan.

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 The Scripture says more about spiritual warfare

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 than it does about marriage.

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 And here are some conclusions.

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 I'll give you the punchlines up front.

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 You don't even need to buy the book.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 This was all for a book.

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 You don't need to buy the book.

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 I'll tell you some conclusions I made.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 It's one, you've got an enemy, he hates you.

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 He hates your spouse before you met your spouse,

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 and he hates your children long before they were born.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And he studied you and generations past,

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 your parents and your grandparents

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 and your great-grandparents,

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 and he knows your inclination to sin.

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 He understands your appetite.

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 And when I say "he," there's thousands,

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 hundreds of thousands of demons, of devils, right?

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 They have a leader, but there's lots of them.

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And he's not in any way--

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 listen, listen--

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 he's not in any way afraid of you.

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 You don't scare him in the slightest.

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 He's not going to be like, "Oh, I know jujitsu."

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 No, that's not going to work, okay?

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 He's terrified of your God.

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 He is terrified of your Jesus.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 So you want to make sure

151
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 that you're the real deal follower of Jesus.

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Like, you don't know of him, you know him.

153
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 You have a--that's different.

154
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 I know of him, I've read his book.

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 That's different than I commune with him,

156
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 I talk with him, I have a relationship with him.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 I know his voice. It's different.

158
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 And let me show you from the Scriptures the danger.

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 There's a story in Acts 19.

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 That's not where I'm going to be, this is just a setup.

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I'm going to be in Ephesians 6, but to set it up,

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 there's a story in Acts 19 where Paul--

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Paul was this dude who was lost,

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 he would have been hung over, you know, at the port.

165
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 He was lost, he was a religious zealot, actually,

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 and a terrorist, okay?

167
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 That's this guy.

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And he has this radical conversion,

169
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 and he becomes the greatest missionary

170
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 the world has ever known, and now the church is moving.

171
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And in Acts 19, people who get near Paul

172
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 are healed in the name of Jesus.

173
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Like, if his shadow falls on somebody,

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 they couldn't walk, and all of a sudden they can walk.

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Like, they couldn't see, now they could see.

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 They couldn't hear, now they could hear.

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 They couldn't talk, now they could talk.

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Like, he's healing people.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 The Spirit of God, through him, is healing people.

180
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 And he's casting out demons.

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 And there's these seven brothers, okay?

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Their dad's name is Sceva.

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Sceva's a Jewish priest.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 And these seven brothers are going around,

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 and they saw Paul.

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Like, they saw him at the porch, hands raised.

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 They're like, "I'll fight all night."

188
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 They're singing a song, you know, getting the tattoos,

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 letterjacked, the whole deal.

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 And so what they do, they see a demon-possessed man,

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 and they go up to him, and they say,

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 "Hey, in the name of Jesus, who Paul talks about, come out."

193
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 This is what it says.

194
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 "One day the evil spirit answered them,

195
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 'Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, but who are you?'

196
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them

197
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 and overpowered them all.

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house

199
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 naked and bleeding."

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Now, here's a question.

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Did that happen?

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Did that really--is that history?

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Is that like--like somebody saw it, they wrote it down.

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Does it happen today?

205
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 I don't know if you caught it.

206
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 It's seven dudes ran up to one guy,

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 and that guy turns on them with a demon,

208
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 and he fights them, and they leave naked and bleeding.

209
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Like nobody's wondering who won.

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 This isn't like, you know, Jake Paul versus Tyson,

211
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 was it thrown?

212
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 You know, nobody's asking.

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Like you go into a fight with clothes on,

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 and you leave without clothes on?

215
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 You lost every time.

216
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 It's like, loser, take the L.

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 You lost to the demon man.

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Why?

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Because they were pretending to know Jesus.

220
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 You know who knew Jesus?

221
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 The demon did.

222
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 They got whooped because they were pretending

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 to have a relationship with Jesus.

224
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 I'm going to be in Ephesians chapter 6.

225
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 We're going to look at the armor of God chapter.

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 I'm going to give you seven articles

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 toward victory in this state of warfare.

228
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 That's the reality.

229
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 If you were a real Christian,

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 you understand you are in real warfare.

231
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 That's not a word we use often,

232
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 spiritual warfare.

233
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And so if you are a real Christian,

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 a follower of Jesus,

235
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 then you understand, right?

236
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 You start reading the book,

237
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 and you understand you are in a battle,

238
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 at war, in warfare.

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 And that's the message today.

240
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 And I'm going to fly.

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 I'm breaking preaching rules.

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 I'm going to go too fast.

243
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 I'm going to give you too much.

244
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 You write down as fast as you can.

245
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Don't get stuck.

246
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 If I say something,

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 you're like, "Oh, let me wonder about that."

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 No, no, no.

249
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Write it down and think about it tomorrow.

250
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Because I'm going to keep going,

251
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 and the train's going to leave you.

252
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 I'm just telling you,

253
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 it's going to be like drinking from a fire hydrant.

254
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 So take notes as fast as you can.

255
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 I'm going to be in verses 10 through 18,

256
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Ephesians chapter 6.

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Paul wrote this.

258
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Here's the setup,

259
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 just so you know what's going on.

260
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Paul wrote this.

261
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 He's in prison in Rome,

262
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 but on house arrest.

263
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 He's got one of those ankle bracelets.

264
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 That's what's going on.

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Some of you got those tonight.

266
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 So we're glad you're here.

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Welcome, welcome, welcome.

268
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Paul's on house arrest,

269
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 most likely chained to a Roman soldier.

270
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 And so as he's kind of talking through these pieces,

271
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 we're like, "Put on the helmet of salvation

272
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 "and the breastplate of righteousness

273
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 "and the belt of truth."

274
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 And like, maybe you grew up in that church.

275
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I'm like, "I don't know what that means."

276
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 I don't do well when I'm like, "Wait, is it on?

277
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 "I don't know 'cause I can't see."

278
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 So I think, here's my suspicion.

279
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 I think Paul is talking about the marks of a true Christian.

280
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Someone who has a real relationship with Jesus,

281
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 an authentic Christian.

282
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 That's what I think he's talking about here.

283
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 And this is what he says,

284
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 "Finally, brothers, finally be strong in the Lord

285
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 "and in his mighty power."

286
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 You don't have to be afraid.

287
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 You have access to God's power.

288
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 "Put on the full armor of God."

289
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 It's not an article, like one thing after the other.

290
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 He's like, "Put it," in the Greek, it's like,

291
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 "It's all on," or not.

292
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 "Put on the full armor of God

293
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 "so that you can take your," what's the word?

294
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 One more time.

295
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 "You can take your," what's the word?

296
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Yeah, "Underline it when you see it

297
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 "'cause you're gonna see it a lot.

298
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 "So that you can take your stand

299
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 "against the devil's schemes.

300
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,

301
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 "but against the rulers, against the authorities,

302
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 "against the powers of this dark world,

303
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 "and against the spiritual forces of evil

304
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 "in the heavenly realms."

305
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 This is huge.

306
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Your enemy is not your roommate.

307
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Your enemy is not your boyfriend

308
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 or your ex-boyfriend's girlfriend.

309
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Okay?

310
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Your enemy is not that person

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 who sat behind you in calculus.

312
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Your enemy's not your neighbor

313
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 whose dog barks in the middle of the night.

314
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 That's not your enemy.

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Your enemy is demons.

316
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 They hate you,

317
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 and they'll use people to discourage you.

318
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 And whenever you cut yourself,

319
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 hate yourself, wanna kill yourself,

320
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 whenever you poison yourself with alcohol,

321
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 and you're like, "This is amazing!

322
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 "One more drink, drink!

323
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 "We're playing drink, and you drink!

324
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 "And you're having fun, and then you're hugging the toilet!"

325
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 They receive it as worship.

326
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 You're like, "Vape, the THC,

327
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 "like, oh man, I just gotta escape my reality!"

328
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 They're like, "Worship."

329
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 You hear me?

330
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 They receive it as worship.

331
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 They love it when you hurt yourself.

332
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Like, you have sex, the soul ties,

333
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 the bonds, and then the rip, and the heartbreak,

334
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 and you can't sleep, and you're crying!

335
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 And they're just like, "This is amazing, guys.

336
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 "Hey, circle up and watch it.

337
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 "He's so pathetic."

338
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And they receive it as worship.

339
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 "I'm not playing games.

340
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 "What's going on?"

341
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Therefore, put on the full armor of God

342
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 so that when the day of evil comes,

343
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 that's the moment of your greatest temptation,

344
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 can't sleep at 2.30 at night,

345
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 what are you gonna do, who you gonna call?

346
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 You may be able to stand your ground,

347
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 and after you've done everything to stand,

348
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 there it is again, then stand firm

349
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 with the belt of truth buckled around your waist.

350
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Okay, we're gonna fly, you ready?

351
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Number one, first point, walk in the truth.

352
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Real followers of Jesus who understand real warfare

353
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 walk in the truth.

354
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 There is a war over what is true,

355
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 and you grew up in a generation, lucky you, right,

356
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 where it's their truth, and your truth,

357
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 and his truth, and her truth, and our truth,

358
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 and that's just not the truth.

359
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Okay, if your truth is you can fly,

360
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 and you go up to the top of the Bank of America building,

361
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 and you jump off, the truth, capital T truth of gravity

362
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 is going to show you that your truth was a lie.

363
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Okay, there is truth, and there's this war

364
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 that's fought over what's true,

365
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 but here's the problem with most of you.

366
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Now hear me out, okay, 'cause I know it feels like

367
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 I'm throwing shade early in the game.

368
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Hear me out.

369
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Most of you aren't on a truth journey.

370
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 You're on a happiness journey.

371
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 You're not asking, well, what's true,

372
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 'cause I wanna pursue that no matter what it costs.

373
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 You're like, what's gonna make me happy?

374
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And that's all I want.

375
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Like if I can believe a lie, and it makes me happy,

376
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 then I wanna believe a lie,

377
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 and if I can know the truth, but it makes me sad,

378
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 then I don't wanna know the truth.

379
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Keep me naive to the truth, right?

380
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Here's the good news, is the truth will set you free.

381
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life,

382
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 and no one gets to the Father except through him.

383
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 That's the good news, and if you believe a lie,

384
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 it may make you temporarily happy,

385
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 but at some point, you're going to come to the realization

386
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 that it's a lie, and it's gonna make you very, very, very sad.

387
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Okay?

388
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 So find the truth.

389
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 With the breastplate of righteousness in place,

390
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 number two, acting in righteousness.

391
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Okay, if you are a real follower of Jesus,

392
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 and you understand that there is real warfare,

393
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 then you are acting in righteousness.

394
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 The breastplate of righteousness, it guards your heart.

395
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 It protects your heart.

396
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Your heart, this is what you need to know about your heart.

397
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Your heart works like Netflix.

398
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Do you guys understand what I mean by that?

399
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Okay, you know how Netflix works?

400
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 You like suits?

401
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 How about The Office?

402
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 What about Office Space?

403
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Right, you like Gossip Girl?

404
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 What about Gilmore Girls?

405
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 What about the Summer I Turned Pretty?

406
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 What about Outer Banks, right?

407
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Just me, no?

408
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Okay, like that's how your heart works.

409
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 You feed it something.

410
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 Some people say, "Well, the heart wants what it wants,"

411
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Selena Gomez.

412
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 No, the heart wants, listen, the heart wants what it's fed.

413
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Okay, your heart wants more of what it's fed.

414
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Listen, okay, because I used to have this,

415
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 because I spent a lot of time here.

416
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 I love this place, man.

417
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 It's like home for me.

418
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 I love you guys, man.

419
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 I look out there, and I'm just like,

420
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 the future of the church is bright.

421
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Oh, praise God.

422
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 I used to have this conversation here all the time, okay,

423
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 right here, right like right there.

424
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 I'd stand there.

425
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Young lady would come up.

426
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 "Pastor, I need help.

427
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 "I need some relationship advice.

428
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 "I only date losers."

429
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 I don't know what's wrong with me.

430
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 I'm only attracted to losers.

431
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Like I'm attracted to guys that hurt me.

432
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Can you help me?

433
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 And I go, "Hey, let me ask you a few questions."

434
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 "Sure, sure, ask away."

435
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Okay, "Hey, what's your favorite songs?

436
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 "What music do you listen to?

437
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 "Who's your favorite artist?"

438
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 She's like, "No, I'm looking for a relationship advice."

439
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 "I got you.

440
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 "Hang in there with me, okay?

441
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 "Hang in there.

442
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 "We're going to get there.

443
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 "Just hang in there real quick.

444
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 "Who's your favorite artist?"

445
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 "Man, I don't know.

446
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 "Sabrina Carpenter, you know, please, please, please.

447
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 "Espresso, that's a jam, a real bop.

448
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 "Anything by Taylor, you know, like the Queen, right?

449
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 "I mean, come on.

450
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 "Oh, gosh, you know, Virginia Beach, Drake,

451
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 "got to throw Kendrick in there, you know, that's..."

452
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 And I go, "Okay, okay, all right, all right, all right.

453
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 "Okay, what's your favorite show?"

454
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 "Oh, man, I may have confused you.

455
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 "I'm looking for a relationship advice."

456
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 "No, I got you, I got you.

457
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 "What's your favorite show?"

458
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 "I don't know, man.

459
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 "Love Island, uh..."

460
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 (congregation laughing)

461
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 "But, Pastor, I just don't understand

462
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 "why I'm only attracted to losers."

463
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 It's because you systematically fed your heart

464
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 through algorithms to only love losers.

465
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 That's why.

466
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And you thought, "Oh, no, it's not,

467
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 "the music doesn't affect me."

468
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Sure it does.

469
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Look at your dating history.

470
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 It affects you.

471
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Okay, you're like, "Do I need to say it louder

472
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 "for the people in the back?"

473
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 It affects you.

474
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Grandma was right.

475
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Garbage in, garbage out.

476
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 It's true, though, right?

477
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 This is how they work.

478
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 It's how they work, I'm just telling you.

479
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Homage to Grandma.

480
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 (congregation applauding)

481
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And with your, verse 15,

482
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 "And with your feet fitted with the readiness

483
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 "that comes from the gospel of peace."

484
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Number three, ready with the gospel.

485
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 If you're following Jesus,

486
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 you understand you're in warfare.

487
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 You are ready with the gospel.

488
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 You represent the gospel.

489
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 The gospel is the greatest news the world has ever seen.

490
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 I was just getting my hair cut.

491
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 That's right, I paid somebody to do this to me.

492
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 (congregation laughing)

493
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 I was there, and the guy, you know,

494
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 he had a bright smile.

495
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 I said, "Hey, listen, do you have a faith?"

496
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 He said, "Yes, I'm a Christian."

497
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And so I asked him these two questions,

498
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 between one and 10.

499
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 10 being certain, one being not so sure.

500
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 If you died today, how certain are you

501
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 that you would go to heaven?

502
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 To which he said,

503
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 he kind of answered somewhere in the middle,

504
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 but I'm gonna ask you guys,

505
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 just 'cause it's, like, I'm home tonight,

506
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 so I'm just curious who were here.

507
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 So I want you to think of a number, one to 10.

508
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 If you were to die today,

509
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 how certain are you that you would go to heaven?

510
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 10 is I'm certain, don't say it out loud,

511
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 just think of the number, right?

512
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 10 is I'm certain.

513
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 One, I probably wouldn't, you know, five,

514
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 I'm not, you know, seven, I don't know where you are.

515
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 I want you to think of your number, okay?

516
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Think of it right now,

517
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 'cause you're gonna do something with this.

518
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 So get a number, round up or down,

519
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 don't go .5 on me, okay?

520
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Just kidding, some of you are like,

521
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 "Oh, man, you caught me."

522
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Get your number, you got it?

523
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Give me a good head nod, "Hey, I got it, I got it.

524
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 "I'm not gonna overthink this, I got my number."

525
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 You got it?

526
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Everybody, you got it?

527
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Okay, everyone close your eyes, okay?

528
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Just for a second, I'm gonna watch your purse.

529
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 I know not everybody's believers.

530
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 (congregation laughing)

531
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Close your eyes, close your eyes.

532
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Got your eyes closed, I'll call you up here so fast,

533
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 don't play with me.

534
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Okay, close your eyes, you too, close your eyes, I see you.

535
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Close your eyes, all right, everybody's got 'em closed.

536
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 All right, okay.

537
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 If you are, you're gonna raise your hand,

538
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 everybody's gonna raise their hand.

539
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 If you are a four, five, or six, raise your hand.

540
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Okay, all over the room, four, fives, and sixes.

541
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Up top, down low, everywhere, four, fives, and sixes,

542
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 you're not alone, okay.

543
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Put it down.

544
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 If you are a one, two, or three, raise your hand.

545
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 And we'll say zero, two, okay, lots of one, twos, and threes

546
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 all over the room, okay, you're not alone,

547
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 you're not the only one, there's lots of you.

548
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Okay, you can put it down.

549
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Okay.

550
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 If you are a seven, eight, or nine, raise your hand.

551
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Okay.

552
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 All over the place, sevens, eights, nines, okay.

553
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Hands down.

554
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 All right, open your eyes.

555
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 So he says I'm a seven, the barber.

556
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 And I say if you stood before God and he said,

557
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 "Why should I let you in?"

558
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 What would you say?

559
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Think about this question.

560
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 If you stood before God and God, the creator of the heavens

561
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 and the earth, says, "Why should I let you in?"

562
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 What would you say?

563
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And this is what he said, and I was surprised by it.

564
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 He said, "Because he sent Jesus to die for my sins,

565
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 and he raised Jesus from the dead."

566
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Okay, and here's why that surprised me.

567
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Almost always, I ask somebody this every day,

568
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 and almost always if they say seven, they go,

569
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 "Well, because I tried hard, because I was good,

570
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 because I went to church, because I read the Bible,

571
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 because I was born a Christian, because my parents are Christian,

572
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 because I," right?

573
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 But it's not what he said, because Jesus,

574
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 because God sent Jesus, which you just need to know, okay,

575
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 so that you're clear.

576
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 That's the right answer, okay?

577
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 But here's what I asked him next.

578
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 I said, "You believe Jesus died for your sins?"

579
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 He said, "Yes."

580
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 I said, "Well, what are you going to do in hell then?"

581
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 He was confused just like you.

582
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 And he said, "What do you mean?"

583
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 And I said, "You told me there's a 30% chance you're going to go to hell.

584
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 The only thing that anybody can do in hell

585
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 is pay for their sins forever.

586
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 The only person who doesn't have to go to hell

587
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 is the person whose sins have been paid for.

588
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Every sin, listen, every sin will be paid for

589
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 either in eternity in hell or on the cross.

590
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 And if you believe that it was paid for on the cross

591
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 through Jesus, then you're going to heaven."

592
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 That's 1 John 5:13.

593
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 "I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God

594
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 so that you may know that you have eternal life."

595
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Scripture says you can know.

596
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Ephesians 3 and 9, "For it is by grace you've been saved through faith.

597
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 It's not of yourself. It's the gift of God,

598
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 not by works so that no one can boast."

599
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 The salvation is a gift from God

600
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 gifted to those, 100%,

601
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 to those who have believed upon Jesus,

602
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 His death and resurrection for the forgiveness of sins.

603
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 So I asked him, "Do you think Jesus died for 70% of your sins?"

604
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 He said, "No, 100."

605
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 I said, "Let's pray."

606
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Okay?

607
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 It's amazing how we can be in church on a Tuesday

608
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 and miss the gospel.

609
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 And I'm not mad at you.

610
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 I'm so angry at times at Satan

611
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 who just distorts the truth a little bit

612
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 and would have you here tonight thinking that you can't be certain.

613
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 You're like, "Well, it would be arrogant for me to be sure that I'm going to be with God."

614
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Arrogant if it had anything to do with you.

615
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 But if it has everything to do with God's work on your behalf,

616
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 then you, like Paul, are boasting in the finished works of Jesus.

617
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 So I'll boast about Jesus, because I can't get in there on my own.

618
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 But Jesus paid my way in.

619
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 In addition, verse 16,

620
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 "In addition to all of this, take up the shield of faith

621
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one."

622
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 If you have a real relationship with Jesus,

623
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 if you understand you are in real warfare,

624
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 you are number four firm in faith.

625
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Firm in faith.

626
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Roman shields were not like trash can lids.

627
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 They weren't like Captain America.

628
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Roman shields were large and wooden.

629
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 They were like doors, like five and a half feet tall doors, pieces of wood.

630
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And to defeat the Romans, all you would need is these flaming arrows, flaming darts.

631
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 You shoot them in the shield, and it would turn into firewood.

632
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 And so Romans learned they could soak a strip of leather in water overnight

633
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 and then coat the outside of that shield with wet leather,

634
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 and it would extinguish the fiery darts of the enemy.

635
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 And so Paul's using this verbiage to say,

636
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 "Hey, you are to stand firm in the faith."

637
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Like you, you're there in your faith.

638
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Your belief in God is your protection.

639
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 I believe, listen, this is an interesting takeaway

640
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 from studying spiritual warfare for three years.

641
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 I believe the enemy can only be victorious in your life

642
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 in direct correlation to how little your faith is.

643
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 The greater your faith, the more your ability to be protected from the enemy.

644
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Okay, when I was in Dallas, when I moved to Dallas, I was not a believer.

645
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 Love the party scene, uptown, lived in uptown, lower Greenville at the time.

646
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 I was there at this bar near the village apartments,

647
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 and I had become a Christian, but I don't have Christian friends yet.

648
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 That's like some of you here.

649
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 I hadn't learned that I need to replace all my old friends

650
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 with new Christ-falling friends, so I'm with all my old friends,

651
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 and we're at the bar, and some of them had had way too much to drink,

652
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 and I'm a brand-new Christian, and so the littlest one of our crew, right,

653
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 he does what guys do when they've had too much to drink,

654
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 is he walks through the bar, and he finds the littlest guy in there,

655
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 and he goes, "What are you looking at?"

656
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 And then they get all like chest-to-chest, guys do that weird thing.

657
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 I don't know what's going on, but they're like bumping each other

658
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 with their chest, you know, two little dudes.

659
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 And so I walk up, and I'm just like, "Hey, man, I'm sober."

660
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 You know, I'm a believer at the time.

661
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 I separate the two of them, and I pause, and say, "Hey, I'm so sorry.

662
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 He's had too much to drink."

663
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 And I go like this, and I'm like, "Hey, I'm going to take him home."

664
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 And he goes, "Don't you touch me."

665
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 And I was like, "No, I'm sorry. We're going to go.

666
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 He's had too much to--I'm sorry, sir.

667
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 I didn't mean to interrupt your evening."

668
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And they get all chest-to-chest again, right?

669
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 So I go again, and I separate them again, and he goes,

670
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 "I told you, don't you touch me."

671
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Hey, man.

672
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Why are you doing that, little buddy, man?

673
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 I'm just like--I'm trying to get my friend home, you know,

674
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 and you don't have to be all mean to me.

675
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 I'm just--I'm trying to get him home, you know, and by that time,

676
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 like, all my boys came, and like my boys,

677
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 they know where the creatine is.

678
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Like, they're big dudes, and they like--and so they circle up,

679
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 you know, there's eight of them, and I'm just like, "Oh, no, guy.

680
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 This is not going to go well for you."

681
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 And he does the craziest thing I've seen, man.

682
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 This guy pulls out his phone, right?

683
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 He's just looking at me, you know?

684
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 You can't tell from down there.

685
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 I'm weird tall, like 6'7", you know?

686
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 You don't--you can't tell down there, but I really am.

687
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 People always come up, like, "I didn't realize you were really 6'7".

688
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 No, I'm a liar. Come on.

689
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 And so he goes--he pulls out his phone.

690
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 I'm watching him, and he pushes a button.

691
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 He goes, "Hey, you here?

692
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Good, I got something I want you to take care of."

693
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 I'm like, "Who was that?

694
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Batman? Who'd you call?"

695
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 You know, and I don't want to find out, so I'm like, "We got to go, man.

696
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Let's go. Everybody--hey, we got to go, guys.

697
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Let's go. Party's over. Let's go."

698
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 And we go outside, and I mean, you know,

699
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Brock Lesnar and Jon Jones had a big--these dudes--

700
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I mean, it was two guys. There was two of them.

701
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 He had a chain around his neck, not like this chain,

702
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 like a chain you pull a car with, with a padlock right here,

703
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 just walking up, like, coming at me, you know?

704
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 And they're like, "These the guys?"

705
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 I was like, "No, sir, they left."

706
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 And I just--but I think about--

707
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 I think about that young man, his response.

708
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 He's just looking at me unfazed, like,

709
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 "You don't know who I know.

710
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 Whatever you're going to do to me, you're not going to do long.

711
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Like, backup's on the way."

712
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 That's what it means to stand firm in the faith.

713
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Like, "No, no, no, no matter what it costs me,

714
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 I'm going to follow Jesus.

715
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 If I'm all by myself, I lose all my followers

716
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 and all my friends,

717
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 my significant other breaks up with me,

718
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 I'm still going to follow Jesus."

719
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Like, because, you know, heaven's--

720
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 I'm going to be in heaven with Jesus forever.

721
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 And so whatever you're going to do to me,

722
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 you're not going to do long.

723
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Like, I'm just going to go with Jesus, okay?

724
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 1 John 4, verse 4 says,

725
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 "Because the one who is in you

726
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 is greater than the one who is in the world."

727
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 So verse 17, "Take up the helmet of salvation."

728
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Helmet guards your mind. It protects your mind.

729
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 This is your thinking.

730
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 Number five, aware of your salvation.

731
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 If you're a real follower of Jesus,

732
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 you understand you are in warfare.

733
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 You are, number five, aware of your salvation.

734
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Wars are fought over real estate, okay?

735
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 And so the enemy is trying to attack your thinking

736
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 by whispering lies to you.

737
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 "You're not pretty enough. You're not fast enough.

738
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 You don't make enough money.

739
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 You're not stylish enough.

740
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 You don't have enough friends. You don't make enough."

741
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 All the things. These are the lies, right,

742
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 that he comes at you with.

743
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 And you've got to be mindful,

744
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 as the Scripture says,

745
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 "Take every thought captive and make it obedient to Christ."

746
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Okay? Because we don't fight with the weapons of the world.

747
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 That's what it says.

748
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 And so you want to reflect.

749
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 What it says is, "Set your mind on the things above.

750
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 Do not conform any longer to the patterns of Dallas,

751
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 but be transformed by the renewing of your mind."

752
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 It's Romans 12, 2.

753
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 And so you're thinking about, stay here,

754
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 you're thinking about, "What does it look like that I'm saved?

755
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 What does it mean that I'm saved?

756
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 How does that impact?"

757
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 And you say, "Well, I can't control my, like, these intrusive thoughts.

758
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 I can't control my thoughts."

759
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Do you know who controls your thoughts?

760
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Do you know who controls your thoughts?

761
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Does anybody know who controls their thoughts?

762
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Anyone?

763
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 They're right.

764
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 You do.

765
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 And the enemy doesn't want you to know that.

766
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 He wants you to be like, "No, intrusive thoughts, they rule the day."

767
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 No, intrusive thoughts come and go.

768
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 What you do with them is up to you.

769
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 You don't think you control your thoughts? Watch this.

770
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Think of a yellow school bus.

771
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Just think of a yellow school bus.

772
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 It's got the yellow side in black.

773
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 It's got the tires.

774
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 See all the windows.

775
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 You see the yellow school bus?

776
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 You see it?

777
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Give me a head nod if you can see a yellow school bus in your mind.

778
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 See a yellow school bus?

779
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 You got it?

780
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Yellow school bus?

781
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Okay, got it.

782
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 All right.

783
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 You just controlled your thoughts.

784
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 That's what you just did, right?

785
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 You're like, "I'm going to think of a yellow --"

786
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 I told you to think of a yellow school bus.

787
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 You said, "Okay, I will."

788
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 And so you did.

789
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 You control your thoughts.

790
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 And so you say, "Yeah, but what about when he tells me to kill myself?"

791
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Tell him no.

792
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 I'm not going to do that.

793
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Like, no, how about I think of Jesus on the cross?

794
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Jesus died in my place.

795
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 I'm going to think about Jesus --

796
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 What if he's like, "Well, cut yourself."

797
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Nah, I don't want to cut myself.

798
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Instead of doing that, I'm going to remind myself that I've been created in the image of God,

799
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 and, you know, my body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in me,

800
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 who I received from God.

801
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 I'm not my own.

802
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 I've been bought by a price, and therefore I'm going to honor God with my body.

803
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 You know, just do that.

804
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Okay?

805
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Like, you don't have to believe a lie.

806
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 You don't.

807
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 And he says, "And the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."

808
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Number six, if you are a real Christ follower in real warfare, you're responding with the word.

809
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 Okay?

810
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 You're responding with the word.

811
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 The enemy is going to lie to you, and you respond with the word.

812
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 You've got to know the truth.

813
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 This is, you know, your offensive weapon, as they say, the mark of a believer, right?

814
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 You respond.

815
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 So Jesus, he's tempted four times, like Satan himself.

816
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Satan's never been anywhere near you, okay?

817
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 Like you got assigned some demon or something, some lower-level snaggletooth demon, right?

818
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Satan's -- he's with rulers and where there's wars.

819
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 He's not omnipresent.

820
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 So you've got some demon tempting you.

821
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 But Satan himself was there with Jesus, and Jesus hadn't eaten in 40 days.

822
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 And Satan tempts him four times, and Jesus responds four times with memory verses from Deuteronomy.

823
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 If your only hope of overcoming Satan is to respond with a memory verse from Deuteronomy, how are you going to do?

824
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Okay?

825
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 And so what might Satan tempt you with?

826
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 How might he lie to you?

827
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 Like what's the temptation that you most face or the lie that you're most, you know, susceptible to believing?

828
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 This is the dialogue.

829
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 What?

830
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 Anxiety.

831
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Like he's like, "Be anxious."

832
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 And what if you were just like Philippians 4, "I'm not going to be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition.

833
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 I'm going to present my request to God with thanksgiving and the peace of God, which transcends all understanding.

834
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 He's going to guard my heart and my mind in Christ Jesus.

835
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 I'm going to go 1 Peter 5, 7.

836
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 I'm going to cast my anxieties on him because he cares for me.

837
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 I'm going to go Matthew 6.

838
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow has enough trouble of its own.

839
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 Who by worrying can add a single hour to his life?"

840
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 What else might he say?

841
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 You're not man enough.

842
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 What if you then respond with, "Okay, well sometimes you can even say, 'Hey, I'm not.

843
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 Like I just got the creator of the heavens and the earth on call, but I'm going to go Genesis 2 on you, right?

844
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 That I've been created in the very image of God, the creator of the heavens and the earth.

845
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 And Philippians tells me that he's going to finish the work that he started in me.

846
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 And Ephesians 2, 10 says that I am his masterpiece created in Christ Jesus to do good works,

847
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 which God has prepared in advance for me to do.

848
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 So therefore I am man enough."

849
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 What else?

850
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 What else?

851
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 What else might he say?

852
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 So the enemy's going to come to you and he's going to say that I'm not loved.

853
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 And you're going to go, "Well, that's interesting."

854
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Because the most famous verse in all of the scripture says, "For God so loved the world,

855
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life."

856
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 And then the scripture says, "This is love."

857
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 Not that one lays down his life for his friends, but that he lays down his life for his enemy.

858
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 That while I was yet a sinner, Christ died for me.

859
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 And here's the deal.

860
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 The purchaser gets to determine the value of something.

861
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 And God, the creator of the heavens and the earth, said that I was so valuable.

862
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 He was willing to give his son for me.

863
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 So it seems like he loves me a lot.

864
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 What else?

865
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 What else might he say to you?

866
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 I heard physical pain.

867
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 What?

868
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 You will fail.

869
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 You will fail.

870
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Here's the deal.

871
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 That's true.

872
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 Like a lot.

873
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 I just like jujitsu that.

874
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 He's like, "You're going to fail."

875
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 I'm like, "You're right.

876
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 You're right."

877
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 But he's the God of second chances.

878
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 Romans 8 says, "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."

879
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 And 2 Corinthians 5 says, "He's no longer counting my sins against me."

880
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 Did you hear that?

881
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 He's no longer counting my sins against me.

882
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 And when he says, "I'm going to inflict pain on you like I did Job,"

883
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 the scripture says, "These are light and momentary afflictions that are producing something in me, a greater joy."

884
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 And in Romans 5, it says that, "I'm going to rejoice in my suffering because it produces in me hope and hope character and character perseverance

885
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 so that I can keep on going because I'm not yet home.

886
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 Like one day I'm going to be home and I'm on my way home, but I'm not there yet."

887
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 And so you just respond to those lies with the scripture.

888
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 Now listen.

889
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 You're like, "Hey, that's cool.

890
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 You're a pastor.

891
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 You went to seminary."

892
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 First of all, no, I didn't.

893
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 Second of all, I'm dyslexic.

894
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 Okay?

895
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 I'm ADD.

896
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 I've failed just about any subject you can think of, right?

897
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 But this is my survival tactic.

898
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 It's like all I got, man.

899
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 So I'm writing.

900
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 I don't enjoy reading anything, like nothing.

901
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 But I do it out of discipline, to discipline myself for godliness so that when the day of trouble comes, I know the truth.

902
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 And pray in the spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests.

903
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord's people.

904
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 If you are a real follower of Jesus, you understand the warfare, you are engaged in prayer.

905
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 You're engaged in prayer.

906
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 Okay?

907
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 I'll just say it like this because I'm running light on time.

908
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 It's like if all of these pieces of armor are in a trunk and the trunk is locked, okay, and you want to put the full armor of God on, the way that you access the armor, the key to the trunk is prayer.

909
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 In every war, the soldier is talking to his commander in chief.

910
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 The soldier is talking to their commander in chief constantly.

911
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 "Hey, I'm walking into this Starbucks.

912
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 Who's in here that I need?"

913
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 I'm not talking about prayer like you're in your closet on your knees.

914
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Those are good prayers.

915
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 I'm talking about praying without ceasing.

916
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 "God, I'm at the porch tonight.

917
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 There's temptation around me.

918
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 Would you strengthen me?

919
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 Is there anyone here you want me to share the gospel with?

920
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 God, I think my neighbor raised their hand.

921
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 Would you give me the courage to have a conversation with them afterwards?"

922
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 You're talking to your commander in chief, okay?

923
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 And so, in summary, if you are a true follower of Jesus, you understand that you are, one, walking in truth, that you are, two, acting in righteousness, that you are, three, ready with the gospel, four, firm in faith, five, aware of your salvation, six, responding with the word, and lastly, you are engaged in prayer.

924
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 And this is what it means to understand that you are in real warfare, okay?

925
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 It's like magic.

926
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 It's not.

927
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 It's just like -- it's just the first letter.

928
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 It spells warfare.

929
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 It's not a big deal.

930
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 Guys, I'm burdened.

931
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 I'm burdened.

932
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 Because there was a lot of you that raised your hand earlier.

933
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 I don't know if you'd have the courage.

934
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 You don't even have to.

935
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 I'm not going to call anybody out.

936
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 But I'm just curious.

937
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 Anybody raised their hand earlier, you just could raise your hand right now and say, "I raised my hand earlier."

938
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 And one of those numbers, I don't know if it was zero or nine, but if you raised your hand earlier, would you raise your hand right now?

939
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 Could you do that?

940
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 Okay.

941
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 There's a lot.

942
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 Like I'm just telling you, there's a lot of -- like most of the room, right?

943
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 Okay.

944
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Thank you for your courage to say that after what I shared.

945
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 I've kind of bet the farm.

946
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 Like I've gone all in.

947
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 This is the great news and why you're here.

948
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 It's really good news.

949
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 I forgot to say that about my barber when I told him that.

950
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 He smiles real big.

951
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 He goes, "That's good news."

952
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 And I was like, it is good news.

953
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 The best news ever.

954
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 You don't have to pay for your sins.

955
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 That's what God did on the cross is he paid for all your sins.

956
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 Like you can be with him forever.

957
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 And so I'm just curious.

958
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 Is there anybody who raised their hand?

959
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 Like a second ago you raised your hand like I was an 8 or I was a 9 or I was a 7 or I was a 5.

960
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 I was a 2.

961
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 And right now you say, you know what, I believe that I'm a 10 because of what Jesus did on the cross.

962
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 I believe -- I'm getting that kind of for the first time.

963
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 I understand he paid for all my sins.

964
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 Not 90% of my sins.

965
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 Not 60% of my sins.

966
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 But all my sins.

967
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 I believe that right now.

968
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 I believe Jesus Christ, all my sins were taken care of on the cross.

969
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 Is there someone who just raised their hand that would say, no, I'm now a 10.

970
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 I was a 7 earlier but now I'm a 10.

971
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 I was a 2 earlier.

972
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 Just keep it up real high.

973
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 Like that's big stuff, man.

974
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 It's like really crazy stuff.

975
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 [Applause]

976
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 This is life-changing stuff because I'm going to ask you to do something.

977
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 And if you didn't just raise your hand, you're like, I don't want everybody to see me, you know.

978
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 I'm going to make it even harder on you.

979
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 Okay.

980
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 This is my gift, my gift to you.

981
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 And this is what it means.

982
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 Like as you follow Jesus and you're going to take your stand against the enemy, your shield of faith is going to increase.

983
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 And I just like if you're here and you're like, hey, I was a 4, now I'm a 10, I was a 9, now I'm a 10.

984
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 You just raised your hand or you didn't and you should have.

985
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 Would you just stand up?

986
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 I'm going to pray over you.

987
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 That's what's going to happen right now.

988
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 Just stand up.

989
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 It's going to feel like you're going to be like everybody is looking at me.

990
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 They are.

991
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 They are looking at you.

992
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 That's true.

993
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 That's true.

994
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 [Applause]

995
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 That's true.

996
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 Yeah.

997
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 Broncos, I want you to come here.

998
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 You right here, Broncos.

999
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 Yeah, yeah, you come here.

1000
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 Yeah.

1001
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 Because I bet you, and y'all just stay standing.

1002
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 It's okay.

1003
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 Everybody is looking at me.

1004
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 They are, for sure.

1005
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 I'm saying this for all of your benefits.

1006
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 Because sometimes I think you hear this and you're like, okay, great.

1007
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 I was a 9, I'm trying.

1008
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 I get the boyfriend and the vape thing.

1009
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 I'm trying.

1010
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 I love to party.

1011
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 I'm trying.

1012
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 Anybody ever feel that?

1013
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 I'm trying.

1014
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 I'm trying to go all in.

1015
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 You know what I mean?

1016
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 Right?

1017
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 Here's what I want you to do.

1018
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 All right.

1019
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 Well, I'll ask you, which would you rather have?

1020
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 This is the real deal.

1021
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 This is $100.

1022
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 You try to spend this, you're going to go to prison.

1023
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 It's $12.

1024
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 It's $12.

1025
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 Which one would you rather have?

1026
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 You'd rather have this one.

1027
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 Hey, real quick, God is the same way.

1028
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 Like he would rather you follow Jesus.

1029
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 If nobody else here did and just you did, like he's like, I would rather you be real than all 3,000 of you pretend.

1030
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 Okay, wherever you're at, wherever you're watching us from, he would rather one of you say, I'm really going to go all in with Jesus than all of you to know every word to the song and just pretend.

1031
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 Right?

1032
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 And so I just want you to -- what's your name?

1033
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 Roxanna.

1034
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 I just want you to try to take this from me.

1035
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 I wasn't ready.

1036
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 Like you took it fast.

1037
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 Good.

1038
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 I want you to try to take it from me.

1039
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 Okay, you did it again.

1040
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 You took it.

1041
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 Try to take it.

1042
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 You can't try to take something that's being freely given to you.

1043
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 You can take it -- listen.

1044
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 Listen, you can take it or you can leave it.

1045
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 That's up to you.

1046
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 But God's given.

1047
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 It's a gift from God.

1048
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 Give it up for Roxanna.

1049
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 That's yours.

1050
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 That's a gift for you.

1051
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 To those of you standing, I am moved by your courage.

1052
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 Okay, just you taking it.

1053
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 The word repeated, stand, stand, stand, stand firm in the faith.

1054
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 Stand.

1055
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 And right now you are standing firm in the faith.

1056
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 If you are sitting and you are a follower of Jesus, you have the Holy Spirit at work in your life.

1057
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 You are like I'm a 10.

1058
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 Would you just throw your hand on the back of somebody standing.

1059
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 You can stand up too.

1060
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 Just stand up around and put your hand on the back.

1061
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 Don't let anybody be by themselves, faithful people.

1062
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 Like you right here, if you are followers of Jesus, move around.

1063
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 Find somebody.

1064
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 Throw your hand on the back of somebody.

1065
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 We're just going to pray over them.

1066
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 That's what's about to happen.

1067
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 We're just going to pray over them.

1068
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 We're moving around the porches.

1069
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 The Holy Spirit has been moving here in ways Kylan has told me about.

1070
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 And I just celebrate that with you all.

1071
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 And so I'm going to pray.

1072
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 If you're a follower of Jesus, pray this out loud with me.

1073
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 And if you stood up tonight for the first time, we're praying it with you.

1074
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 You can pray it with me.

1075
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 And there's nothing magic about these words.

1076
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 It's about the heart behind these words, okay.

1077
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 And so I'll just say a line and you can repeat it.

1078
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 Dear God in heaven, I have ran from you.

1079
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 I have sinned against you.

1080
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 I have gone my own way.

1081
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 And I know that you sent Jesus to die for my sins.

1082
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 And you raised him from the dead.

1083
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 Would you give me that same spirit and guide me in this life,

1084
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 walking towards you everlasting.

1085
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 Thank you for salvation.

1086
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1087
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 The Lord's salvation has visited you tonight.
