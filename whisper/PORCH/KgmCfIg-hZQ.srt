1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040
 (congregation cheering)

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,240
 Hey, because the majority of those of you in the room

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,760
 are from outside, not just of Dallas, but Texas.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,600
 Welcome to Awaken and welcome to Texas.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,120
 (congregation cheering)

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,680
 It is gonna be an amazing next few days

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,320
 and we are so excited and been praying so much

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,800
 and we're gonna dive in and talk for the next few days

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,320
 about what it looks like to walk in the way of truth,

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,960
 to be united and have hearts that are united together,

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,280
 undivided hearts.

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,280
 I'm gonna read the passage that we're gonna be in tonight

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,640
 as we open up the first topic.

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,560
 And that's in 2 Timothy 3.

15
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,360
 If you have a Bible, you can flip open

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,160
 to 2 Timothy 3.

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,960
 Some of the last words the apostle Paul would ever write.

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,960
 If you don't have a Bible, it'll be up on the screens.

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,440
 And I'm gonna start in verse 14.

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:56,840
 Paul says, "But as for you,

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,200
 continue in what you have learned

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,560
 and have firmly believed,

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,840
 knowing from whom you learned it

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,480
 and how from childhood you have been acquainted

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,520
 with the sacred writings,

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,760
 which are able to make you wise for salvation

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,080
 through faith in Christ Jesus.

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
 All scripture is breathed out by God

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,200
 and profitable for teaching, for reproof,

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,040
 for correction and for training in righteousness,

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,640
 that the man of God may be complete,

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,560
 equipped for every good work.

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,640
 I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus,

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,280
 who is to judge the living and the dead

35
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,840
 by his appearing and his kingdom,

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,160
 preach the word, be ready in season and out of season,

37
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,160
 reprove, rebuke and exhort

38
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,120
 with complete patience and teaching.

39
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,240
 For the time is coming when people

40
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,680
 will not endure sound teaching,

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,760
 but having itching ears,

42
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,320
 they will accumulate for themselves teachers

43
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,720
 to suit their own passions or desires

44
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,840
 and will turn away from listening to the truth

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,200
 and wander off into myths.

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,120
 As for you, always be sober minded,

47
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,360
 endure suffering and do the work of an evangelist.

48
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,560
 Fulfill your ministry."

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,400
 Let me pray one more time.

50
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,880
 Father, thank you for your word.

51
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,840
 Thank you that it is living and active and alive.

52
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,200
 Thank you for every person that you've gathered here.

53
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,680
 As we unpack the incredible truths that you preserved,

54
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,360
 would you illuminate our minds

55
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,960
 to see the glory of God in the face of Jesus

56
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,200
 and in beholding Jesus to be changed?

57
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,400
 In Christ's name, amen.

58
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,000
 Like I said, the theme for this weekend is undivided hearts.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,440
 And that comes from the verse that we just read.

60
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,480
 I'm gonna read it one more time,

61
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,360
 specifically verse 11 of Psalm 86.

62
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,320
 "Teach me your way, O Lord,

63
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,800
 that I would walk in your truth,

64
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,080
 unite my heart to fear your name."

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,960
 And as we were praying and looking at this year,

66
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,800
 it's been an unbelievably divisive year

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,080
 that we're all coming out of called 2020.

68
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,600
 And the church is commanded over and over in scripture

69
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,480
 to be united together, to be united together as one.

70
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,520
 So we're gonna walk through different topics

71
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,880
 that we are to have undivided hearts around,

72
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,360
 that we are to be united together in.

73
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,960
 And because we're talking about that,

74
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,040
 I thought I'd launch into tonight's conversation

75
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,200
 by bringing up one of the most divisive words

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,840
 in the past five years.

77
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,680
 Ready for it?

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,600
 You missed it.

79
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,720
 If you didn't hear it, you missed,

80
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,120
 no, that's totally not true.

81
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,280
 (congregation laughing)

82
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,120
 Did we have it?

83
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,840
 And?

84
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,680
 Laurel.

85
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,840
 Run it back.

86
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,120
 I'll just do it, laurel.

87
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,040
 (congregation laughing)

88
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,440
 That word was like five years old and it's distant,

89
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,000
 but this week my family came across that word again

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,960
 somehow and I played it for my kids

91
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,160
 and I'm gonna show you the reaction

92
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,080
 that they've never heard it.

93
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,240
 For you, it's old news, it happened five years ago,

94
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,400
 lit the internet on fire and everybody heard different things

95
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,240
 but here's the reaction that they had

96
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,040
 when they saw it this week and played.

97
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,840
 And candidly, as their father, I was shocked.

98
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
 What kind of kids am I raising?

99
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,880
 Here's what happened.

100
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,400
 All right, what does it sound like?

101
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,720
 - Laurel. - Yell.

102
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,440
 - Yell? - Laurel.

103
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,680
 - Yell.

104
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,480
 - Laurel.

105
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,160
 - What's that sound like?

106
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,480
 - Yell.

107
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,440
 - One more?

108
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,960
 - Yeah, yell.

109
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,800
 - Yell?

110
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,640
 - Laurel.

111
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,800
 - What's it sound like?

112
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,640
 - Yell.

113
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,800
 (congregation laughing)

114
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,520
 - So that was their first reaction.

115
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,880
 And in this room, I think we can all agree,

116
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,680
 let's say what the actual word is on three.

117
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,080
 Ready, one, two, three.

118
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,560
 - Laurel.

119
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,960
 - Yeah, it's divided.

120
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,200
 We are looking at the same thing

121
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,280
 and what we believe about what is true is divided.

122
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,280
 That's one of those situations

123
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,480
 where people can be looking at the same thing

124
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,160
 and when it comes to, hey, what's true, we're divided.

125
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,960
 There is a way to find out what is actually true.

126
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,800
 And it's not based on what you hear, what you think,

127
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,240
 what your opinion is.

128
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,120
 There's a way to actually know, is it Yanny or is it Laurel?

129
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,960
 What is that way?

130
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,480
 You go to the creator of it to discover what is true.

131
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,720
 And the creator actually came out and said,

132
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,960
 "Hey, it was Laurel."

133
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,920
 And for whatever reason, just the Jedi mind trick

134
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,360
 that different people hear different things.

135
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,720
 But in a similar way of how do I know what's true?

136
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,520
 It doesn't go based on what I think, what I feel,

137
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,760
 my opinion.

138
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,560
 I can go to the creator to discover what is true.

139
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,560
 Not of some tune or sound clip, but of our world, of life,

140
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,040
 of where life is found, of purpose,

141
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,880
 of what is truth in general.

142
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,320
 And as Christians, you and I are commanded,

143
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,160
 tonight's topic is talking about being united in truth.

144
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,760
 And truth being God's word.

145
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,440
 And specifically, we're gonna cover three things

146
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,400
 from God's word we've got to be united in, unanimous about.

147
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,280
 In other words, there's things in God's word

148
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,560
 where there could be different interpretations,

149
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,400
 where people could disagree and still be united.

150
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,140
 But the things we're gonna talk about tonight

151
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,560
 are three key imperatives for anyone following Jesus.

152
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,040
 We have got, the church has to be united around

153
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,480
 and united in truth.

154
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,240
 Tonight's topic is a topic that sadly,

155
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,360
 because Christians have not been united

156
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,520
 in believing these things,

157
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,160
 or people who claim to be Christians

158
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,740
 have not been united around these beliefs,

159
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,400
 have seen the church be ineffective, unloving,

160
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,480
 and not what Christ calls them to be.

161
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,440
 There are three things that,

162
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,120
 depending on whether you embrace them or not,

163
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,620
 are gonna play a huge, pivotal role

164
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,600
 in whatever the future of your life holds.

165
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,500
 So I'm gonna walk through and we're gonna unpack

166
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,560
 what is kind of the main point,

167
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,520
 what does the Bible point us to,

168
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,760
 what it tells us or how it instructs us,

169
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,640
 and how we are to represent it.

170
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,560
 I'm gonna start in verse 14.

171
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,040
 And before I do, let me set up a little bit,

172
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,180
 as I said, this was written by Paul.

173
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,240
 So the Apostle Paul was the apostle formerly known as Saul,

174
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,100
 spent half his life trying to kill Christianity,

175
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,520
 trying to stop out Christianity,

176
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,880
 gets saved and becomes the greatest missionary

177
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,200
 arguably the world has ever seen.

178
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,480
 God uses him to write more of the New Testament

179
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,880
 than anybody else.

180
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,320
 And he wrote incredible letters and he sits down

181
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,080
 and this would be the final letter he would ever write.

182
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
 In other words, the most influential missionary

183
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,800
 or Christian evangelist of all time

184
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,720
 wrote all these different letters

185
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,960
 and we're about to read not just the last letter,

186
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,140
 but part of the last chapter he would ever write.

187
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,920
 At the time, he's sitting in a cold dungeon cell

188
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,000
 awaiting his death.

189
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,520
 Many scholars believe he's months, if not weeks,

190
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,960
 away from being let out into a courtyard

191
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,240
 and being beheaded, which is how history tells us Paul died.

192
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,640
 And he sits down and he writes these words

193
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,200
 and they're to a very particular person.

194
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,320
 He writes to Timothy.

195
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,680
 If you know anything about Timothy,

196
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,800
 the relationship Paul had with Timothy

197
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,400
 was an incredibly deep one.

198
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,200
 All throughout the New Testament, Paul will reference him

199
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,040
 and at one point he says,

200
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,200
 "There's no one like Timothy in my life.

201
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,480
 I have no one else like him."

202
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,120
 He was Batman and Timothy would have been his Robin.

203
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,360
 Timothy would travel with him,

204
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,640
 would have helped write letters with him,

205
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,720
 go Batman and Robin.

206
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,600
 Timothy was the protege of Paul.

207
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,760
 And Paul sitting in this prison writes to Timothy

208
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,840
 who is leading a church in Ephesus.

209
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,000
 He's leading a ministry.

210
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,680
 And Paul begins to talk about the importance of this book

211
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,040
 to Timothy, to the future of the church, to you and I.

212
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,120
 And he brings up some really key things

213
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,960
 that a lot of Christians don't either understand

214
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,860
 or have never even been taught about what this contains

215
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,340
 and why it's so significant to the church.

216
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,620
 So in verse 14, he says this,

217
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,840
 "But as for you, continue in what you have learned

218
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,040
 and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it."

219
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,760
 We're told in chapter one, it was his mom,

220
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,520
 he had a godly mom and a godly grandmother

221
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,880
 that taught him the scriptures.

222
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,200
 "And how from childhood you have been acquainted

223
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,760
 with the sacred writings."

224
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,600
 I'm gonna come back to that in a second,

225
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,660
 'cause it's a really important word.

226
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,480
 "Which are able to make you wise for salvation

227
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,680
 through faith in Christ Jesus."

228
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,760
 For salvation, the sacred writings,

229
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,920
 for salvation through faith in Jesus.

230
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,060
 For salvation through Jesus.

231
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,600
 Now, why do I say sacred writings

232
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,460
 is a really important word to understand.

233
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,440
 What I think is one of Paul's

234
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,460
 most significant verses he writes.

235
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,840
 He says, "The sacred writings that are able to make you wise

236
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,280
 for salvation through Jesus."

237
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,080
 Well, when Paul wrote the word sacred writings,

238
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,520
 he would eventually be talking about the New Testament,

239
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,600
 but at this time, if you know your history,

240
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,440
 the New Testament wasn't around,

241
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,480
 or wasn't completely compiled.

242
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,500
 The term sacred writings was even a Hebrew term

243
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,780
 for the Old Testament.

244
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,520
 That Paul brings up the Old Testament, and he says,

245
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,120
 "Hey, you know what the Old Testament makes sure

246
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,540
 that you hold onto those truths

247
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,120
 that are for salvation through Jesus."

248
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,280
 When he brings up the sacred writings,

249
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,560
 the Old Testament is for salvation through Jesus.

250
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,320
 That Paul, translation would say,

251
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,440
 "The Old Testament, all of the Bible,

252
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,360
 and especially at this time, the Old Testament,

253
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,960
 all of it is about Jesus."

254
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,880
 The focal point and the main character

255
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,600
 of the Bible is Jesus, and that's really important.

256
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,780
 I'm about to unpack why.

257
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,880
 Understanding that when you and I approach the Bible

258
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,800
 is key to how we take, because what we believe about it

259
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,560
 will determine what we receive from it.

260
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,480
 And Paul's gonna say, "Hey, the whole thing

261
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,200
 has been about Jesus."

262
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,800
 The main character, or the main idea,

263
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,640
 is not a bunch of principles or self-help rules.

264
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,120
 It is about a person whose name is Jesus.

265
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,040
 All throughout the Old Testament,

266
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,020
 we discover it's all been pointing to him.

267
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,120
 Jesus, in John chapter five, would even say this

268
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,660
 to a group of Pharisees who were a religious group

269
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,400
 of leaders who were so studied in the Old Testament.

270
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,160
 They had the first five books of the Torah memorized.

271
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,620
 And Jesus says this to them.

272
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,840
 "You search the scriptures because you think

273
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,680
 they give you eternal life, but the scriptures point to me.

274
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,460
 Yet you refuse to come to me to receive this life."

275
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,460
 Jesus would say, "The Bible is not about principles.

276
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,360
 The Bible is not even about the Bible.

277
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,540
 The Bible is about Jesus."

278
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,100
 And any understanding that you and I have,

279
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,700
 first and foremost, has to be that all throughout

280
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,460
 the Bible, it is pointing me to Jesus,

281
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,780
 not to a bunch of rules, not to a bunch of principles,

282
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,780
 primarily to the person of Jesus.

283
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,940
 And another occasion, Jesus is walking along the road

284
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,980
 in Luke chapter 24, and he brings up this exact idea again,

285
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,700
 where he says, "Was it not necessary that the Christ

286
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,220
 would suffer these things and enter into glory?"

287
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,380
 And beginning, talking about Jesus,

288
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,340
 "With Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted them

289
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,580
 in all the scriptures, the things concerning himself."

290
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,300
 That you and I are to come to God's word

291
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,020
 with the understanding it is, first and foremost,

292
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,420
 it's not about you, it's not about rules,

293
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,800
 it is about Jesus.

294
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,120
 And pointing humanity to their savior,

295
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,080
 the one who would come to die for their sins.

296
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,840
 Even the foreshadowing of the stories,

297
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,960
 these incredible stories are not just about good men,

298
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,600
 and let's have some takeaways from them.

299
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,320
 These men's stories are types of pointing,

300
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,440
 are types of Christ that point to Jesus.

301
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,280
 What do I mean by that?

302
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,320
 Moses, the guy who would go and lead God's people

303
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,680
 out of Egypt, leading them out of slavery and bondage

304
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,040
 into a promised land of rest.

305
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,920
 Just like Jesus, who would lead God's people

306
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,880
 out of slavery to sin, into eternal life,

307
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,840
 or God's promised destination.

308
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,040
 Noah, God told Noah, "Go build a boat, it's gonna rain,

309
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,040
 it's gonna be really, really rainy for the next 40 days.

310
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,880
 Build a boat."

311
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,080
 Noah goes, builds a boat.

312
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,680
 Every person who trusted in that piece of wood,

313
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,500
 called an ark, that was lifted up as the waters poured in,

314
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,420
 was saved.

315
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,560
 Just like Jesus, and every person who trusts

316
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,720
 in that piece of wood that our Savior was crucified onto,

317
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,040
 that was lifted up, will be saved.

318
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,120
 Abraham, Abraham was called by God,

319
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,640
 "Hey, I want you to go and sacrifice your son."

320
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,580
 It says, "Your one and only son."

321
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,700
 Moments before he's about to kill his son Isaac,

322
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,120
 God shows up and says, "Don't kill your son,

323
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,560
 because I'm gonna kill mine."

324
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,160
 And Jesus, in John chapter eight, would say,

325
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,280
 "Abraham," and if you know the story,

326
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,200
 there's this moment, he's looking,

327
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,720
 he's about to kill his son, and all of a sudden,

328
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,080
 a voice says, "Don't kill your son."

329
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,240
 And he looks up and there's a ram.

330
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,160
 God provided another sacrifice.

331
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,000
 And Jesus, in John chapter eight, said,

332
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 "Abraham looked and saw my day coming, and rejoiced."

333
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,720
 Over and over, the story of David and Goliath.

334
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,480
 The David goes, kills the giant of Goliath,

335
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,880
 just like Jesus would come, and he would kill the giant,

336
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,480
 not of Goliath, but of sin and death.

337
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,600
 And what did he do it with?

338
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,840
 Five smooth stones.

339
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,680
 Think about this.

340
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,920
 He only uses one.

341
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,700
 Why are we told there's five?

342
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,880
 Well, in Hebrew, the Hebrew number five

343
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,880
 is the number for grace.

344
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,720
 Every page points to Jesus.

345
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,400
 Jonah spent three days in the belly of a well,

346
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,720
 just like Jesus, spent three days in the belly of the earth,

347
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,160
 and Jesus walks through all of it.

348
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,240
 It's all about me.

349
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,480
 If Abraham was here, he would say, "It's all about him."

350
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,520
 If Moses was here, he'd say, "It's all about him."

351
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,640
 It's all about Jesus.

352
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,980
 And understanding this is key, because here's what happens.

353
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,240
 People come to the Bible and they make it a self-help book.

354
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,240
 You know what the focus of a self-help book is?

355
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,440
 Self.

356
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,400
 The focus of the Bible is not you, it's Jesus.

357
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,040
 And when you and I approach it and we go to read it,

358
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,560
 we read it, because if it's about Jesus,

359
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,760
 here's what it is, it is a love letter.

360
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,360
 Jesus is the full expression of God's love on the cross,

361
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,520
 and we come and read it, and now we read every page,

362
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,580
 not basking in condemnation, 'cause that's about you.

363
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,360
 We read it going, man, this is who my God is.

364
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,720
 This is who my God is.

365
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,240
 This is what my God has done.

366
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,920
 This is where life is found through Jesus.

367
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,860
 And Paul, remarkably and so incredibly,

368
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,360
 before there was any New Testament completed,

369
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,760
 said, "Hey, Timothy,

370
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,600
 all of those Old Testament verses, they're all about Jesus.

371
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,640
 Don't lose sight, don't lose hope, don't let go of that."

372
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,480
 The main character of the Bible

373
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,280
 is Jesus from beginning to end.

374
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,440
 It's amazing how many Christians

375
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,840
 that will make the focal point something else.

376
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,560
 They're familiar with the scripture,

377
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,000
 and maybe you were raised in church,

378
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 you've been around it and you've seen it,

379
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,920
 and you've never, but you missed the point.

380
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,520
 It's right in front of your face all this time.

381
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,440
 It's all about Him.

382
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,120
 It's not dissimilar to this.

383
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,280
 There was a logo I was looking at today

384
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,720
 that I'd never connected the dots before.

385
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,040
 It's a logo I've seen every day,

386
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,280
 last five years probably.

387
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,900
 It's a logo that all of you have seen

388
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,080
 over and over and over again.

389
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,000
 It's this logo right here.

390
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,840
 It's Amazon.

391
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:43,320
 Do you know that the arrow is there to communicate?

392
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,240
 We sell everything from A to Z.

393
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,600
 Yeah, I know.

394
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,840
 Man, the emotional attachment to Amazon in this room

395
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,360
 is quite remarkable, honestly.

396
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,480
 You look at that every single day,

397
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,180
 you've never connected those dots.

398
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,600
 And in a similar way, people will spend time in the Bible,

399
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,520
 or they were raised in Sunday school, raised in the church,

400
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,520
 and they were around it all the time,

401
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,280
 and they never connected the dots.

402
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,920
 It's all about Jesus.

403
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,400
 And Paul says, first and foremost,

404
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,440
 before we get anything else, let's be very clear.

405
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,680
 The main character is Him.

406
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,760
 And then he goes into how it plays its role

407
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,840
 inside of our life, and who the author is,

408
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,920
 which informs how it plays that role.

409
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,920
 He says this, "All Scripture is breathed out by God."

410
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,080
 Let me read that again.

411
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,320
 A lot of us have heard that verse before,

412
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,560
 but I wanna slowly think about what he's saying.

413
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,360
 "Every word is breathed out by God,

414
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,300
 "and profitable for teaching, for reproof or correction,

415
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,780
 "and for training in righteousness

416
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,260
 "that you and I may be equipped or complete

417
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,780
 "and equipped for every good work."

418
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,460
 I wanna unpack what Paul just said.

419
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,220
 The second idea is the author of the Bible is God.

420
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,820
 The main character is Jesus, the author is God,

421
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,780
 which has some real significant implications.

422
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,740
 And it tells us how to think about what we're reading here.

423
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,860
 The author being God, every word is inspired.

424
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,980
 It's a word, we have no other record

425
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,620
 of this word being used.

426
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,140
 It was breathed out by God himself.

427
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,820
 It's alive, if you will.

428
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,340
 It was breathed out by God,

429
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,820
 inspired the words of God himself.

430
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,060
 When Old Testament writers

431
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,200
 or New Testament writers were writing, they wrote it,

432
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,820
 but God was inspiring the words that would be recorded

433
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,140
 and would be written down.

434
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,740
 This generation, more than any other generation,

435
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,460
 says something that I both love

436
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,620
 and also think they're not taking advantage

437
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,460
 of where they could.

438
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,900
 In other words, for whatever reason,

439
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,060
 the last five years, language like,

440
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,620
 "Hey, I want a word, I wanna hear a word."

441
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,260
 Man, that's a word, that's a word right there.

442
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,860
 "I wanna hear a word from God, I want a word from,

443
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,100
 "man, I'm just looking for a word from God,

444
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,140
 "looking for a word."

445
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,460
 That everyone is obsessed with,

446
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,260
 "Man, I wanna hear a word from God."

447
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,260
 And yet they don't open the word of God and read it.

448
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,140
 And know, hey, and I'm not saying God can't speak,

449
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,980
 I'm saying he has spoken.

450
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,580
 And he can speak in other ways beyond that,

451
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,420
 but he has very clearly spoken.

452
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,060
 In fact, let me just press a little bit harder here

453
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,060
 'cause this is really important

454
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,100
 and it's thrown out, especially in dating world

455
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,940
 and young adult world.

456
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,540
 What people will say, these two words, "God told me."

457
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:28,660
 Those are three of the most powerful words

458
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,660
 you could ever say.

459
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,860
 "God told me."

460
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,580
 If you hear that or that comes out of your mouth

461
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,760
 and what follows next is not,

462
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,940
 "God told me," in Romans chapter 12, verse one.

463
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,100
 (congregation laughing)

464
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,780
 You should better have heard from God

465
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,940
 and it better align with his word

466
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,220
 or seen some sort of writing on the wall,

467
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,220
 or you are representing something

468
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,340
 that may or may not be what God told you,

469
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,740
 especially if it contradicts what God says in God's word.

470
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,100
 In other words, perhaps a better way to say it,

471
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,420
 even if you're like, "Man, I really think

472
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,960
 "this is what I'm supposed to do is,

473
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,660
 "I think God told me."

474
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,620
 I think, I mean, that's honestly what's most accurate.

475
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,940
 You don't know, you're just going, "Hey."

476
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,900
 And often it's like, "Man, I was driving down the road

477
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,820
 "and God told me."

478
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,540
 And what you mean is not, "I want you to move to Dallas."

479
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,080
 You mean, "And then my friend, she posted on Instagram

480
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,780
 "about like, I love Dallas so much."

481
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,300
 And I was like, "Man, maybe I would like Dallas too.

482
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,660
 "Maybe this is God."

483
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,340
 Maybe it is, maybe it's not.

484
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,780
 Maybe a better thing to say is,

485
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,300
 "I think maybe God wants me to move in Dallas."

486
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,460
 But representing something that you can't clearly articulate

487
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,220
 or especially if it doesn't align with God's word,

488
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,700
 you are stepping in dangerous territory.

489
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,860
 Especially you should take that off the table

490
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,220
 in a dating world.

491
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,600
 And if somebody breaks up with you and they say,

492
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,660
 "Hey, I feel like God told me,

493
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,940
 "or God wants me to be single."

494
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,700
 You should thank God that this person

495
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,560
 is not a big enough responsible person to say,

496
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,840
 "You know what, I just need to break up with you

497
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,900
 "'cause I don't wanna date right now."

498
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,780
 And they're blaming it on God and God's up there like,

499
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,020
 "No, I didn't say that.

500
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,660
 "God didn't blame it on me, man."

501
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,740
 But we know everything that God says,

502
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,660
 we can have confidence.

503
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,620
 It is inspired, God told me.

504
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,300
 And then he says, "Hey, this is how God and his word

505
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,040
 "is useful inside of our life or profitable for teaching."

506
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,700
 This is huge, man, this is so huge.

507
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,180
 God's word, here's how to understand what God's word is.

508
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:28,180
 It is teaching you about the person of Christ

509
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,380
 and the perspective of God.

510
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,940
 It teaches us the person of Jesus and God's perspective,

511
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,940
 which is the right perspective or the true perspective

512
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,740
 'cause he's the creator.

513
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,340
 And when we read the Bible, we see

514
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,020
 and are able to more clearly see

515
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,980
 how God says we're to think about our time,

516
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,620
 how God says we're to think about marriage,

517
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,820
 how God says we're to use our relationships,

518
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,780
 how God says we're to use our tongue, our mouth,

519
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,620
 what is true, what matters, how this life is a vapor.

520
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,660
 We're introduced to God's perspective in the Bible.

521
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,980
 In other words, the Bible is not a magic eight ball

522
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,020
 that you go to and just go,

523
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,100
 "What am I supposed to do with my life?

524
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,300
 "Am I supposed to marry her?"

525
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,780
 And flip it open and just hope that it's there,

526
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,380
 which is honestly, this is a magic eight ball.

527
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,340
 This is how a lot of people read their Bible,

528
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,520
 where they go to it and they're like,

529
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,700
 "Man, am I supposed to move to Dallas

530
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
 "or maybe I'm supposed to take that job?"

531
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,640
 (congregation laughing)

532
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,940
 Yes, definitely.

533
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,540
 And they'll do the same thing.

534
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,140
 It doesn't look like a magic eight ball, though.

535
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,860
 They do it with the Bible and they flip it open.

536
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,180
 (laughing)

537
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,220
 Some of you guys, this is you.

538
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,620
 They're like, "Man, I don't know

539
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,640
 "if I'm supposed to marry Sarah,

540
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,740
 "I'm supposed to keep dating Sarah,

541
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,060
 "or maybe I'm supposed to ask Sarah out."

542
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,260
 And they flip it open and they're like,

543
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,780
 "And Abraham married Sarai."

544
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,500
 (congregation laughing)

545
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,340
 God.

546
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,140
 Sarah, God told me I'm supposed to marry you.

547
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,140
 (congregation laughing)

548
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,860
 And it's not how you're supposed to apply the Bible.

549
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,860
 It is the words of God that introduce you

550
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,480
 to the perspective of how God thinks.

551
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,540
 And how God would say to see work,

552
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,860
 to see relationships, what matters in marriage,

553
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,420
 and who to marry.

554
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,940
 And in studying it,

555
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,460
 we're able to not rip things out of context.

556
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,620
 Because that's the danger.

557
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,020
 And Candle, I'm gonna pick on preachers.

558
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,900
 Preachers can rip things out of context

559
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,620
 and say, say something, make the Bible say something

560
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,100
 that is not what it was saying,

561
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,300
 or is not saying to you.

562
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,620
 And I'm not saying it's necessarily untrue,

563
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,420
 but you can rip it out and you can make it say anything.

564
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,420
 The other day I was with my kids

565
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,420
 and we were about to go hang out and do scooter races.

566
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,020
 My son and my daughter.

567
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,020
 And my son goes here and he's at church on Sundays

568
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,300
 and they were learning about Genesis and Adam and Eve.

569
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,140
 And he looks at me and goes,

570
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,740
 "Dad, boys win, girls lose."

571
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,820
 And I was like, "Really?"

572
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,900
 Yeah, because Adam was made first.

573
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,060
 So he got here first and the girl got here second.

574
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,360
 So boys win, girls lose.

575
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,580
 Now, biblically, that is an accurate sentence,

576
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,500
 Adam was made first.

577
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,740
 It is not an accurate application to go, so girls lose.

578
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,860
 And that's funny when you're five.

579
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,740
 When you're 25, it is sad.

580
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,620
 It is more common than you think.

581
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,660
 And so understanding, man, I come to God's Word

582
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,740
 and I'm gonna read it, I'm gonna understand what it says.

583
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,960
 I'm gonna prioritize knowing it in my life.

584
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,920
 To do that, I have to spend time in it.

585
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,100
 Not going through reels on Instagram or some sermon clip.

586
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,020
 I'm gonna spend personal time.

587
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,900
 There's never been more resources on how to do this.

588
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,500
 Let me give you a couple that are amazing.

589
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,300
 There's a project, there's a group called Bible Recap

590
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,820
 that is an incredible resource.

591
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,180
 There you go, got some fans of it.

592
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,700
 They're gonna walk you through God's Word in a year.

593
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,060
 There's another app called Dwell app.

594
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,180
 There's You version.

595
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,860
 There's never been more resources

596
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:46,860
 on how you can personally walk intimately

597
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,300
 and listen to God.

598
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,040
 Spend time every day.

599
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,760
 You know what the word listen and silent have in common?

600
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,860
 All the same letters.

601
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,480
 In order to listen to God,

602
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,760
 it requires me being silent personally.

603
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,400
 God, will you speak to me?

604
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,420
 I wanna study and understand what you are saying here.

605
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,320
 So it teaches us and then it corrects or reproves us,

606
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,560
 which is a word that I don't think a lot of us often like

607
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,760
 because when we think correction,

608
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,080
 we hear the voice of condemnation.

609
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,440
 We hear God going, get it together!

610
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,220
 How long is it gonna be like this?

611
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,160
 Maybe because of a parent

612
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,320
 or maybe because of family relationship

613
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,520
 or whatever reason, you just read it

614
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,300
 and you just feel like shame.

615
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,980
 Because of Jesus and what he did on the cross,

616
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,200
 there is no shame and guilt for followers of Christ.

617
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,560
 So any loving correction is just that.

618
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,680
 It is a loving, hey, I'm gonna move you back on the path.

619
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,080
 It's how I want you to use your tongue.

620
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,520
 It's how I want you to speak.

621
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,880
 And when you come to it, I'm gonna go,

622
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,040
 man, God, this is what you say to do.

623
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,880
 And so I'm gonna trust you.

624
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,080
 You're a loving father that's not shouting,

625
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,960
 condemning at me, but lovingly correcting me.

626
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,320
 It's like the Waze app.

627
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,760
 I don't know if you guys use Waze or Apple Map,

628
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,680
 Google, they all work the same, but Waze is better.

629
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,560
 And that app, it does something.

630
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,920
 If you miss the turn, it course corrects.

631
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,960
 In other words, if you're driving on the road

632
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,800
 and sometimes you're just like,

633
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,280
 man, is this the street, is this the street?

634
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,400
 You miss the exit and it doesn't say,

635
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,380
 hey, just back the car up and go back on the highway.

636
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,760
 It course corrects.

637
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,280
 It shows you, all right, we missed that one.

638
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,180
 Here's how you get back on the path.

639
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,520
 That's what God's word does.

640
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,600
 It's called a light, a lamp unto our feet,

641
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,440
 a light to our path.

642
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,600
 It's God saying, man, here's how to continue

643
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,800
 getting back on the direction.

644
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,080
 Here's how you should have relationships,

645
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,480
 authentic community around you.

646
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,680
 I'm gonna keep course correcting.

647
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,040
 I'm gonna keep encouraging you to stay on the path.

648
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,440
 It also tells us that there should be times

649
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,720
 that as believers, man, when you read the Bible,

650
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,040
 it's gonna disagree with you.

651
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,480
 Like, if this happens, man, when you read verses,

652
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,480
 and like, Jesus at times should bother you.

653
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,980
 Like, you're like, man, that's not what I would wanna do

654
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,900
 or I would wanna live.

655
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,420
 And that's, Paul would say, it's correcting,

656
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:02,920
 aligning us with God, with God's word says.

657
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,860
 You have times where you can even think like,

658
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,700
 oh man, there's times where God,

659
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,580
 man, it's not what I would do,

660
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,220
 but it's what God clearly says, so I'm gonna do it.

661
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,100
 It's not the direction I would go,

662
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,380
 but it's clearly the course correction

663
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,200
 that God would have me take.

664
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,780
 I'm gonna do it.

665
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,340
 Paul says all of this is what we get access to

666
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,380
 through the perspective of God.

667
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,060
 And then finally, the training in righteousness

668
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,540
 to be complete, to be equipped for good works,

669
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,580
 to live out our faith.

670
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,580
 Let me give a side note really quick.

671
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,420
 A lot of people have a question of,

672
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,860
 man, I don't know if I can trust the Bible.

673
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,980
 And they don't trust the Bible 'cause say,

674
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,420
 some professor at some college was like,

675
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,100
 you know, the Bible contradicts itself

676
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,740
 and it's been changed over time.

677
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,140
 Let me share something.

678
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,080
 In grad school, we had to take classes

679
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,440
 on some of the most boring things

680
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,680
 I've ever studied in my life.

681
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,540
 And you know what they were?

682
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,760
 Some of the differences in the manuscripts

683
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,240
 or the passing on of the New Testament.

684
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,160
 Why do I say that they were boring?

685
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,400
 Because you would study and you're like,

686
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,760
 dude, I'm about to find out,

687
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,800
 people say the Bible's been changed,

688
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,640
 I'm about to find out which places it has,

689
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,280
 and they walk it through.

690
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,520
 Let me give you an example of one of the changes.

691
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,160
 There's a place in the Bible

692
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,100
 where one version has John with two Ns

693
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,480
 and one has it with one.

694
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,340
 In other words, there's no place where you read it

695
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,480
 and it's like, man, this one says Jesus was crucified,

696
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,520
 this one says he got kicked by a donkey,

697
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,860
 and this one says he fell off a cliff.

698
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,920
 Doesn't exist.

699
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,680
 Because the changes or any of those changes

700
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,900
 are so insignificant.

701
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,240
 We have so many copies, we know what the essence

702
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,820
 and truth and what was actually written that is there.

703
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,360
 People don't reject the Bible

704
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,400
 'cause it contradicts themself,

705
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,640
 they reject it because it contradicts them.

706
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,200
 They don't like what it says about homosexuality,

707
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,600
 they don't like what it says about sexuality,

708
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,800
 about dating, about relationships,

709
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,680
 and we can clap, but if you're in that camp

710
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,600
 and still like, man, I think so,

711
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,480
 but I don't really know, you at least owe it to yourself

712
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,040
 to say, I am going to study

713
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,240
 and be informed about what it is.

714
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,840
 I'm not gonna hide behind, well,

715
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,840
 you know, I saw an Oprah one time at the Bible,

716
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,060
 because you'll discover it hasn't been changed.

717
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,760
 It is trustworthy, you can trust it,

718
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,320
 and it is the voice of God, inspired by God himself.

719
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,600
 And then Paul finishes and tells us something

720
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,620
 that's so key to us, and he writes,

721
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,200
 and he's writing these last words,

722
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,360
 and it would be hard to estimate

723
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,640
 how much emotion Timothy would have

724
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,720
 when he read these things,

725
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,280
 and Paul would have when he said and wrote these things.

726
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,520
 All these years of walking in relationship,

727
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,640
 being mentored by Paul, being led to Christ by Paul,

728
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,160
 and Paul, knowing he's about to die and go be with the Lord,

729
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,840
 writes these things to Timothy,

730
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,160
 and they apply not just to him, but to us.

731
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:56,360
 I charge you, in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus,

732
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,080
 who is to judge the living and the dead,

733
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,100
 and by his appearing and his kingdom,

734
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,800
 preach the word or share the gospel.

735
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,440
 Be ready in season and out of season,

736
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,480
 when it's popular and when it's not popular.

737
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,920
 Reprove, rebuke, and exhort

738
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,680
 with complete patience and teaching,

739
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,160
 for the time is coming

740
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,580
 when people will not endure sound teaching.

741
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,760
 Let me read that again,

742
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,280
 because he begins to describe a time

743
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,640
 that is strikingly parallel to the moment that we're in.

744
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,760
 A time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching,

745
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,440
 the teaching of what God's word says,

746
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,880
 but having itching ears,

747
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,340
 they will accumulate for themselves other teachers,

748
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,880
 other things to suit their own passions

749
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,800
 or their own desires.

750
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,520
 They'll find things that allow them, hey, you do you.

751
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,000
 Don't let anybody tell you to be different.

752
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,480
 You should embrace who you are.

753
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
 Love is love.

754
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,280
 You choose what is best for your body and your choice,

755
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,640
 and they won't hold to truth,

756
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,360
 and they will turn away from listening to the truth

757
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,380
 and wander off into myths.

758
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,520
 As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering,

759
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,720
 and do the work of an evangelist or an ambassador.

760
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,240
 Fulfill your ministry.

761
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,720
 Paul, knowing he's about to go, he says,

762
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,840
 man, Timothy, hold onto this book,

763
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,580
 and not only that, share this book.

764
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,560
 Let it inform your life.

765
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,160
 Other people are gonna wander off into myths.

766
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,480
 Other people are gonna wander off

767
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,320
 and searching for things that'll just inform them

768
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,520
 to whatever they want to do.

769
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,120
 They'll look for somebody to reinforce that, but not you.

770
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:36,880
 You hold onto truth, and you share what is true.

771
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,060
 The main character of the Bible is Jesus.

772
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,720
 The author of the Bible is God,

773
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,600
 and the ambassadors of the Bible are you and I

774
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,240
 or anyone just like Timothy who is a follower of Christ.

775
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,580
 We are called to now go and share what was shared with us,

776
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,240
 that we are not to be, you know,

777
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,740
 brand ambassadors are huge right now.

778
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,820
 You and I are called to be brand or Bible ambassadors

779
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,300
 for God in how we speak and how we live it out

780
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,060
 and how we promote it to other people.

781
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,300
 In other words, Paul brings up,

782
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,820
 hey, it should inform your life.

783
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,660
 You and I should be able to say,

784
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,980
 hey, let me tell you I believe the Bible

785
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,060
 without telling you I believe the Bible

786
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,020
 through how I live.

787
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:23,820
 And he would say, you and I are the ambassadors

788
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,660
 of what is true.

789
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,620
 A time is coming where people are gonna turn away

790
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,500
 and wander into myths.

791
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
 What does this look like?

792
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,940
 I think probably one of the more common expressions

793
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,820
 in our culture where we're seeing this happen,

794
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,540
 where they wander from truth and wander to a myth

795
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:43,140
 is a common ideology around truth,

796
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,560
 that truth is no longer a universal thing.

797
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,900
 You hear people in the way that they talk,

798
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,900
 common vernacular is, truth is not universal.

799
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,640
 I mean, what's true for you may not be true for him,

800
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,900
 and you need to do your truth and speak your truth.

801
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,500
 It's not universal.

802
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,780
 And you can define what you think is true.

803
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,860
 It's a message that's everywhere.

804
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,900
 And it's a message that has significant consequences

805
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,340
 because no longer are you going,

806
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,900
 hey, this is the source of truth.

807
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,500
 I'm going to God on how to live.

808
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,260
 I just go off of me.

809
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,540
 And our culture and the world around us,

810
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,580
 it is clearly wandered off into myths.

811
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,340
 What do I mean by that?

812
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,180
 Unlike the Bible, which teaches there's two genders,

813
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,540
 there's male and female.

814
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,120
 The explosive movement around transgenderism is staggering,

815
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,900
 but it is what happens and makes sense.

816
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,500
 If you don't have a source of truth,

817
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,740
 you just define what is truth.

818
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,380
 In fact, in 2014, Facebook released at that time, 2014,

819
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,500
 here are the 58 genders that we believe exist.

820
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,740
 This isn't some random guy in a basement.

821
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,980
 This is one of the biggest companies in America.

822
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,460
 And it's what happens when you don't have a source of truth.

823
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,920
 You're your source of truth.

824
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:00,040
 And Paul says, you're going to wander off into destruction.

825
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,640
 They're going to walk through and define it.

826
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,320
 Man, that's not what God says.

827
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,740
 This is what I say.

828
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,840
 On the subject of life, my wife and I are pregnant

829
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,560
 with our third child right now.

830
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,400
 (congregation cheering)

831
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,240
 Thank you.

832
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:20,200
 We had a almost 20 week sonogram this past week,

833
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,040
 and it was actually right at 19.

834
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,180
 And in fact, here's a picture.

835
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,940
 This is our baby.

836
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,400
 Hand reaching up, see his nose.

837
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,180
 When you don't have a source of truth,

838
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,400
 like God's word that says, man, life begins at conception.

839
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,920
 If abortion is a part of your story,

840
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,660
 there is so much grace and love,

841
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,380
 and God has nothing before you.

842
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,860
 He wants to use that and heal that

843
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,700
 and be more deeply united to you

844
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,580
 than you could even understand.

845
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,740
 But when you and I,

846
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,500
 or when a culture doesn't have a source of truth,

847
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,600
 they just define it, you lead to things like,

848
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,460
 that's not a human life if the mom disagrees

849
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,660
 or if the mom doesn't want it.

850
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,460
 And in every state in the country,

851
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,560
 including this one until a few days ago.

852
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,860
 (congregation cheering)

853
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,700
 Yeah.

854
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:15,420
 Someone could make the decision,

855
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,420
 I don't want to have that life anymore

856
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,900
 and have a child terminated.

857
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,980
 Because it's what happens

858
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,120
 when you wander away from the truth and you define,

859
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,860
 because the truth for a lot of people is like,

860
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,740
 hey, it's my body, you don't have a choice over it

861
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,000
 to tell me to do with my body,

862
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,620
 which contradicts the truth from God's word.

863
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,460
 And you know what?

864
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,180
 There's things I wouldn't write,

865
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,620
 it's not comfortable to say,

866
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,620
 it's not, oh, you know, like, hey, this is just my opinion,

867
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,580
 but I'm still called to think, to live, to share,

868
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,900
 to kindly with patience and love,

869
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,940
 especially as it relates to Christians.

870
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,620
 The concern God has for people who don't know Jesus

871
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,820
 is first and foremost, knowing Jesus.

872
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,100
 But when it comes to being united,

873
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,300
 being united on what is true,

874
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,060
 on things like his creation, life,

875
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:07,380
 are non-negotiables for followers of Christ

876
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,020
 or things related to the idea of marriage

877
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,100
 and a culture when you don't have truth,

878
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,900
 it's, hey, love is love, it doesn't matter who you marry.

879
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,740
 When God says there is clear design

880
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,860
 that I have for the context of marriage,

881
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,820
 there's so many of these myths,

882
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,260
 like faiths, all of them teach the same thing,

883
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,420
 good people go to heaven.

884
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,540
 Or on an individual level,

885
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,040
 probably as much, if not more common in this room,

886
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,300
 of myths like, hey, living with your girlfriends,

887
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,860
 not that big of a deal, we save rent,

888
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,300
 married in God's eyes, having sex before marriage,

889
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,140
 you know, we're gonna get married,

890
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,020
 we love each other anyways, not that big of a deal,

891
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,940
 which are myths.

892
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,180
 And Paul would say, Timothy, hold onto the truth,

893
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,700
 let what informs your life and your decisions

894
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,500
 be the words of God himself,

895
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,140
 that that will be the guide, the instruction,

896
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,300
 that you're gonna hold onto

897
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,180
 when everyone else is walking away.

898
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,780
 That in other words, he uses a phrase,

899
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,500
 in season and out of season,

900
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,740
 which is a phrase that means you share and you hold these

901
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,440
 when it's popular and when it's not popular.

902
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,660
 There should be times that it's Jesus' followers,

903
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,980
 according to Paul, everybody else is walking this way,

904
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,140
 and because of what the Bible says, we go,

905
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,320
 man, I gotta go this way.

906
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,620
 That if everyone always agrees with you,

907
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,380
 and the world always agrees with you and how you think,

908
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,780
 you don't think like the word of God,

909
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,540
 you think like the world around you.

910
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,940
 And you and I are called to be informed and to hold on.

911
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,820
 He says, Timothy, this book is so crucial

912
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,900
 for you to live God's call on your life,

913
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,340
 and it's gonna be crucial, Timothy,

914
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,420
 for generations of the church to come.

915
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,060
 I'm dying, Timothy, I'm about to go,

916
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,540
 I'm gonna see Jesus' face soon,

917
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,300
 and you're gonna be here, and while you're here,

918
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,100
 I want you to know you have everything you need in Christ

919
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,860
 through the Spirit of God and the word of God

920
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,580
 with the people of God, and you live it out,

921
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,840
 you hold onto it, Timothy.

922
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,220
 When everybody else walks away from it,

923
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,300
 you hold onto it and you don't let go.

924
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,900
 And he would say the same to you and the same to me.

925
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:03,540
 My wife this week was driving her car

926
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,260
 and she called me on Monday, and we're headed to,

927
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,380
 I was headed to coach my son's soccer team,

928
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,480
 and she called me and she was gonna drop him off

929
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,540
 at a soccer practice and I was gonna meet him there.

930
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,460
 She called and she said, hey, somebody just rolled up

931
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,500
 next to me and rolled the window down and says,

932
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,540
 ma'am, your car is smoking, there's liquid coming out

933
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,580
 of the bottom and the engine, and she said,

934
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,820
 and then the engine just went overheated,

935
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,580
 the overheating light came on and it began to shut down

936
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,780
 and I pulled into a parking lot.

937
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,860
 Called a tow truck, got it taken to the auto repair place,

938
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,540
 and I asked the auto repair, you know, what's going on,

939
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:38,380
 and they eventually discovered that the coolant tubes

940
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,980
 had disconnected, and all that coolant

941
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,060
 that keeps the engine cool and allows it to function

942
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:48,320
 had been disconnected, and so it was not able to drive

943
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,140
 because it wasn't able to function,

944
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,460
 because it had been disconnected

945
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,160
 from the thing that allowed it to.

946
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:58,880
 Paul is telling Timothy, you stay connected.

947
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,620
 Don't get disconnected from the thing

948
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,440
 that will allow you to function.

949
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,580
 From one of the primary things, the spirit of God

950
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,620
 and the word of God and the people of God,

951
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,300
 don't get disconnected from any of those,

952
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,020
 and don't get disconnected, but you be united in truth

953
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,620
 that you would walk in God's way

954
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,420
 so that your faith will function,

955
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,200
 and if you are not spending time and listening to God,

956
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,580
 you are being disconnected or are disconnected.

957
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,780
 I don't mean personally, not that you listen

958
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,180
 to a podcast on the way here, not that you, you know,

959
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,700
 read a verse a day just on some scrolling

960
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,740
 through a meme on Instagram, I mean personally.

961
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,140
 God, I wanna listen, I want my relationship with you,

962
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,520
 not someone else's, I wanna listen to you.

963
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,540
 He would say, you're disconnected

964
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,740
 from one of the primary things that allows your faith

965
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,260
 to flourish and to function.

966
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:46,500
 In conclusion, the Bible tells us about the person of Jesus,

967
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,800
 the main character, Jesus.

968
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,960
 It teaches us the perspective of God

969
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,220
 from the author who's God, and it prepares us

970
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,580
 to live God's way or to be ambassadors for the Bible.

971
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,940
 Let me close with one verse.

972
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,420
 There's a verse that, a couple verses that Jesus,

973
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,460
 it was hours before he was gonna be crucified.

974
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,580
 It's called the High Priestly Prayer.

975
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,180
 It's several chapters in the book of John.

976
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,420
 Jesus prays and prays for his disciples that are there,

977
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,420
 and he's literally hours from going to die.

978
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,540
 And he's praying over his guys, and he's praying,

979
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,940
 God, would they be united just like me and you are?

980
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,020
 And he's praying that they would have truth

981
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,580
 that would transform them.

982
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:30,780
 And then he brings up another group of people,

983
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,340
 and he says, I wanna pray for these.

984
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,180
 And it's not the 12 that are there.

985
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,300
 He brings up you, and he brings up me.

986
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,260
 And I wanna walk through what he prays,

987
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,580
 because it's at the heart of Jesus saying,

988
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:50,580
 the same idea of the importance of how God's word

989
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:54,340
 leads us to him, to God's perspective,

990
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:58,060
 and it's something that we allow to lead our life.

991
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,860
 John chapter 17, he says this, verse 17.

992
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,660
 Speaking of the father, do you make them holy?

993
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,580
 Your translation may have sanctified them

994
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,260
 or transform them, God, by your truth.

995
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,300
 Teach them your word, which is truth.

996
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:22,020
 Just as you sent me into the world,

997
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,660
 I am gonna send them into the world.

998
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,660
 And I give myself as a holy sacrifice for them

999
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:33,100
 that they can be made holy or transformed by your word.

1000
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:38,420
 I am praying, and he switches the focus

1001
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,420
 to include not just them, not only for these disciples,

1002
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:49,260
 but also for anyone who will ever believe in me

1003
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:54,900
 through their message, which is you and me.

1004
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,220
 I pray that they will all be one, united,

1005
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,300
 just as you and I are one, as you are in me,

1006
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,700
 the father, and I am in you, so that they may believe,

1007
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,700
 they may be in us so that the world will believe you sent me.

1008
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,980
 Jesus says, Father, I pray for these guys.

1009
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,540
 I pray that you would allow your truth to transform them.

1010
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,140
 And I don't just wanna pray for these.

1011
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,180
 I wanna pray for anyone who will ever believe in me,

1012
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,420
 for you, that they would walk in that truth

1013
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,540
 and be united together.

1014
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,140
 Why was Jesus so passionate about that?

1015
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,660
 I'm laying on the plane.

1016
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,820
 Because he knew that it is in walking with him,

1017
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,980
 living according to what he says is true,

1018
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:42,740
 that you and I are the light

1019
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,860
 in the midst of a world of darkness.

1020
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,340
 And we are united together to push back,

1021
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,340
 not just what we feel is right, but what he says is right.

1022
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,180
 In the midst of a world full of darkness,

1023
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:57,180
 light spreads and shines and pushes back what is dark.

1024
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,740
 It's like this, Billy, you bring the lights down.

1025
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:05,820
 All of you on your wrists, bracelets.

1026
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:12,500
 And the movement of Christ has always been

1027
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,940
 that his people would be informed,

1028
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,620
 and being informed by God's word, they would be a light.

1029
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,180
 And the more disconnected you are

1030
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,020
 from the truth of God's word, the less of a light you are.

1031
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,860
 But whenever you live, and I live out what God says in here,

1032
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,860
 we become a light that pushes back in a world of darkness,

1033
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,620
 and the darker it gets, the brighter the light seems.

1034
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,300
 And the movement of Christianity has always spread

1035
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,380
 on people who are surrendered to the word of God.

1036
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,540
 And it begins to spread, and it begins to spread,

1037
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,260
 and it begins to spread, and it begins to spread.

1038
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,860
 And I want you to imagine what would happen in our world

1039
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,100
 if the 4,000 here just say,

1040
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,020
 I'm not listening to what Beyonce says,

1041
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,580
 what Culture says, what Vogue magazine says,

1042
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:52,500
 what BuzzFeed says, I'm listening to the word of my creator,

1043
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,980
 to God Almighty, I'm gonna walk with Jesus

1044
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,740
 from the truth of his word.

1045
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,140
 The world would be awakened to the source of life,

1046
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:05,140
 the source of hope, the source of peace,

1047
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,980
 and the source of truth, which is Jesus.

1048
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:14,260
 And in the Bible, we encounter him, his perspective,

1049
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,180
 and are given the chance to go share that

1050
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:21,100
 with the world around us, united in truth.

1051
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,940
 We pray, Father, I thank you that you made him

1052
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,140
 who knew no sin to become sin, so that in him,

1053
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,700
 we would become the righteousness of God.

1054
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,700
 I pray that this would be a generation

1055
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,340
 that says, though none go with me, I will follow.

1056
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,700
 I'm gonna walk like God calls me to.

1057
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,900
 I'm gonna do it imperfectly,

1058
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,260
 I'm gonna do it with people around me,

1059
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,780
 but I am gonna hold on to what is true,

1060
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,820
 and I'm gonna hold on to my Savior.

1061
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:52,420
 And then I, as I study, I'm reminded of who he is,

1062
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,220
 who he says I am, where life is found.

1063
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,700
 And I pray that you would unleash a movement

1064
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,980
 across our country of revival through the men and women here

1065
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,300
 who live categorically different

1066
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,060
 than how everyone in their town lives,

1067
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,300
 everyone in their apartment lives,

1068
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,340
 everyone in their city and college lives.

1069
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,540
 And as you transform them,

1070
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:18,140
 they would be a part of how you transform the world.

1071
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,020
 Teach us to know your ways,

1072
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:26,060
 that we would walk in your truth.

1073
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,340
 We worship you in song, amen.
