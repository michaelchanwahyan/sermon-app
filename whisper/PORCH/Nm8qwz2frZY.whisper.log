[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.760]   - All right, well, welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.440]   friends in Fort Worth, friends in Houston,
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.440]   El Paso, Tulsa, Cedar Springs, wherever you are, tuning in.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.160]   We are continuing this series, Vice and Virtue.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.240]   I'm gonna start with a story that'll give us
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.320]   some direction for where we're going.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.200]   A few years ago, at something we call staff prayer,
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.840]   once a week, our staff at Watermark,
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.120]   couple hundred of us get together and meet Tuesdays,
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.640]   and it's usually almost exclusively staff,
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.080]   and every once in a while, someone who has a relationship
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.040]   with a member on staff will get invited to be a part of it.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.120]   And so, there was a guy who was a missionary in Russia,
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.640]   who had been there for the last eight years,
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.920]   he was formerly in Dallas, had some connections
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.040]   and relationships with people on our staff,
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.680]   and he was back visiting, and so he came
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.960]   and he joined us for staff prayer.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.680]   And so, we're sitting around in this circle,
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.760]   and he's sharing about what God is up to in Russia,
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.320]   and then there was a chance for just kind of like
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.120]   a conversation that took place with him,
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.480]   and one person asked him, hey, you haven't been here
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.400]   in eight years in Dallas, what has changed?
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.160]   And I'll never forget his answer,
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.080]   'cause he like immediately had an answer.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.600]   He said, oh, all the storage units,
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.800]   or all the storage facilities.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.420]   And our response was a lot like your response.
[00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.200]   All the storage facilities?
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.040]   What are you talking about?
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.860]   All the storage?
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.120]   Yeah, all the storage facilities, they're everywhere.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.040]   These little like facilities where you store stuff
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.120]   and where you put your stuff, like they're popping up,
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.100]   they're exploding, and we all, almost as a staff,
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.360]   everyone that was there that day,
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.840]   we would laugh about it now, 'cause we all
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.680]   had the same experience.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.920]   What are you talking about?
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.120]   And then we left and we would go drive around,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.000]   and then it was like, there are storage units
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.840]   everywhere around here.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.680]   This is crazy.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.000]   I mean, you drive up 75, 635, I'm certain it's the same
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.320]   in Fort Worth and in Houston, and there really are.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.240]   As he just said, man, Americans have so much stuff
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.320]   that they are running out of places to even put it
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.160]   in their house.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.000]   Most people are concerned about,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.640]   will we even be able to have a house?
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.180]   We are concerned about, are we gonna have a house
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.360]   for our stuff to put in?
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.840]   And really, it's not just something where I'm inviting you
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.240]   to, hey, now you'll drive around and see it,
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.840]   though now you will.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.880]   It is a, as I looked into that idea this week
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.400]   or was studying this week, it's crazy
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.000]   how many storage unit facilities we have in America.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.960]   Like if there was a gold medal sport called hoarding,
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.120]   America is gonna win first, second, and third every time.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.800]   Like here's what I mean by that.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   There are 58,000 storage unit facilities in America.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.100]   Not storage units, not like, oh, one little box counts
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.800]   as one, facilities or different locations for these places.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.800]   58,000, that is more than McDonald's,
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.200]   number of McDonald's, Starbucks, Walmarts, Walgreens,
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.600]   CVS, and 7-Eleven combined.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.200]   In other words, it's like, man, this is Starbucks
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.360]   in every corner.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.240]   There is 10 times as many storage unit facilities,
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.760]   look it up, as there are Starbucks, not right now,
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.100]   but look it up.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.960]   I mean, if you combine all of those, Walmart, 7-Eleven,
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.240]   Walgreens, CVS, Starbucks, McDonald's,
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.920]   those golden arches you see everywhere,
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.640]   they pale in comparison to the number,
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.520]   there's almost four times as many storage unit facilities.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.440]   It's crazy.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.360]   In all of Europe, this is going to where I promise,
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.920]   in all of Europe, if you were to guess,
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.840]   how many storage unit facilities, like, you know,
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.840]   Europe's really big, it's bigger than America.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.860]   How many do they have over there?
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.300]   America has 58,000, Europe has 2,400 total.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.800]   I mean, it is an American phenomenon.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.740]   We are the world-class best in sport at accumulating stuff,
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.700]   stuff, stuff.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.700]   And the reason I start there is because we live in a culture
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:03.320]   that we're so inoculated to this idea
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.900]   that it's almost hard for us to believe
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.000]   that we are really pursuing more and more stuff.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.500]   And the Bible has a name for a group of people
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.440]   who pursue accumulating more money and more wealth,
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.960]   greedy.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.780]   Tonight, we're gonna continue the series Vice and Virtue
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.980]   and look at what Jesus says about the topic of greed,
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.820]   vice and virtue is essentially where each week
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.860]   we've been taking a cultural vice,
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.320]   so laziness, entitlement, pride,
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.820]   and covering it with a biblical virtue to replace it with.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.140]   And everyone who came in the room tonight,
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.120]   here's the hard thing about greed,
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.900]   'cause it's gonna be almost impossible for me
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.740]   to convince any of us that we struggle with greed,
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.740]   'cause you're like, I'm not greedy.
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.060]   I mean, greedy is like the top billionaires,
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.240]   1% out there, taken from everybody else.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.720]   They've got a basement full of coins
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.240]   that they're just swimming in at night,
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.400]   and that's the greedy people.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.440]   That's not me.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.240]   And what we're gonna see is Jesus says
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.600]   that greed has nothing to do with how much you have
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.000]   and everything to do with your heart.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.520]   And it's complicated by the fact that greed
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.520]   really is one of those things that hides,
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.420]   it's hard to see in the mirror,
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.400]   because it hides behind kind of other things
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.480]   or other good things, we would say.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.680]   Oftentimes, people who are greedy say things like,
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.180]   I'm not greedy, I'm just cautious, okay?
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.520]   I'm a saver.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.200]   Or, hey, I'm not greedy, which is, by greed,
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.380]   I just mean the desire, the preoccupation
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.240]   with accumulating wealth or stuff.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.600]   They'll say things like, dude, I'm not greedy.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.080]   It's like, I was raised poor.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.380]   I am never going back there.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.940]   I'm gonna make it in life, I'm gonna get more money,
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.840]   and I'm gonna set myself up and be successful.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.520]   Or it'll hide behind anxiety.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.400]   Or it'll hide behind just like, I'm not greedy,
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.600]   I just appreciate the finer things in life, okay?
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.780]   And it is almost impossible to see in the mirror,
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.100]   but the effects that it has are really much easier to see.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.200]   I mean, people will sacrifice their family
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.300]   on the altar of greed.
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.480]   They'll sacrifice their marriage.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.120]   And it just looks like working a job
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.320]   and pursuing, climbing the corporate ladder,
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.980]   they'll sacrifice relationships with their children.
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.000]   They sacrifice their health.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.260]   People commit suicide over greed.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.600]   I mean, it is clear, it is causing a wave of destruction.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.200]   And if any people on the planet, and maybe in history,
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.840]   are in danger of what Jesus says is an epidemic of the heart
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.600]   that will turn you away from God,
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.520]   it's gotta be the richest people
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.720]   in the history of the world, which is you and me,
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.320]   as Americans.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.520]   And so tonight, we're gonna explore what Jesus says
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.660]   about really what is the source of greed
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.960]   and what greed is going to lead to,
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.280]   and what are the side effects,
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.200]   one of the side effects that Jesus points to,
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.960]   and where the solution for greed is.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.120]   So we're gonna be in Luke chapter 12.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.160]   If you have a Bible, you can flip over to Luke chapter 12.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.460]   If you don't, it'll be up on the screens.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.580]   Luke chapter 12, we'll start in verse 13.
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.360]   And let me say one last preface before we dive in.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.200]   Money and church is weird.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.700]   Can we all agree?
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.540]   I mean, it just is.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.840]   I mean, if you're here, and maybe you invited a friend
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.560]   for the first time, you're like, oh my gosh, really?
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.520]   I chose the money night?
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.840]   My friend finally came with me,
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.680]   and you guys are gonna talk about money?
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.720]   'Cause people associate like, oh, the church,
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.840]   for whatever reason, God always needs my money.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.280]   We don't ever pass a plate here, we never have,
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.480]   we don't want your money.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.200]   And what's challenging as a preacher or a pastor
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.400]   is if I talked about money as much as Jesus
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.320]   talked about money, no one would come.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.920]   Jesus talked about money, you may not know this,
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.880]   more than heaven and hell combined.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.380]   I mean, think about that.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.320]   It was in his top list.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.080]   He talked about money four times
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.520]   as much as he talked about prayer.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.960]   Prayer's a big deal, prayer's important.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.080]   Jesus was like, yeah, let's hit money again.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.440]   'Cause he knew there's something about it
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.080]   where unlike nothing else almost,
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.600]   it fights for your heart and it fights for my heart.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.200]   And it can build this like, man,
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.040]   I find security and identity in money.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.680]   And so he hits it head on over and over and over again.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.440]   And so we're gonna hear from him
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.600]   on one of the dangers of it, and we'll start in verse 13.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.200]   What's going on in Luke chapter 12
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.480]   is there's this big crowd that's gathered around Jesus.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.480]   If you look in verse one of chapter 12,
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.920]   a few verses before, it essentially says
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.960]   thousands of people are gathering around,
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.960]   and one of them asks a question of Jesus,
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.160]   and it leads to our teaching tonight.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.360]   So here we go, verse 13.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.320]   Someone in the crowd said to him, that's Jesus,
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.800]   "Teacher, tell my brother to divide
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.320]   "the inheritance with me."
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.660]   So in this culture, brothers would split the inheritance.
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.840]   It was exclusively went to the brothers
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.240]   because it was assumed that a sister or a daughter
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.720]   would marry into another family
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.240]   and receive the inheritance kind of of that brother
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.000]   or son, and so the sons were to divide the inheritance.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.040]   Apparently someone's dad had died,
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.120]   and the older brother was not dividing it
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.040]   according to his younger brother fairly.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.080]   Jesus says this, "Man, who appointed me judge
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.520]   "or arbiter between you?"
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.480]   Then he said to them, "Watch out.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.400]   "Be on guard against all kinds of greed."
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.360]   He says emphatically, hey, you need to be on guard.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.840]   It's almost like be careful.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.920]   Everyone be on alert and watch out for greed.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.600]   Why would you have to have such alert?
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.960]   Because Jesus knew that greed is one of those things
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.040]   that it's so subtle, it's not like other sins.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.540]   It's difficult to see.
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.920]   It's not like adultery where you're like,
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.600]   I'm not sure, am I committing adultery?
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.480]   I'm not sure, that it's difficult to see.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.440]   No one ever comes down, I've never had this conversation
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.960]   where somebody comes down front afterwards,
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.880]   happens every week, someone will come down front
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.500]   and wanna talk about something going on
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.560]   that they're walking through their life
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.980]   or a struggle that they're having.
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.680]   Often they'll be like, hey, can I just pull you aside?
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.720]   Can we talk just for a second?
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.200]   And never once has anyone ever pulled me aside
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.280]   and been like, hey, I just feel like I'm,
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.760]   is this okay to talk?
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.160]   I feel like I'm struggling with greed.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.120]   And like it never happens.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.880]   People will pull aside and hey, I'm struggling with porn,
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.240]   I'm struggling with pot, I'm struggling with insert,
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.740]   whatever, but it's almost a sin
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.280]   that we really don't even know how to feel guilty about it
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.800]   or how to identify it, and Jesus is about to tell us.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.080]   But the second thing he also points to,
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.560]   if you notice, is that he says, look,
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.500]   be on guard against all kinds of greed.
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.080]   Like there's more than one type of greed, Jesus?
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.640]   And he's gonna tell us what that is.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.040]   For life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.440]   Verse 16, and then he told them this parable.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.040]   The ground of a certain rich man
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.560]   yielded an abundant harvest.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.460]   He thought to himself, what shall I do?
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.140]   I have no place to store my crops.
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.700]   Then he said, this is what I'll do.
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.640]   I will tear down my barns and I will build bigger ones
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.600]   and there I will store my surplus grain.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.400]   And I'll say to myself, you have plenty of grain
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.200]   laid up for many years.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.880]   Take life easy, eat, drink, and be merry.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.160]   Now if the story ended right there, if we hit pause,
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.120]   if you're sitting out in the audience,
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.960]   so basically Jesus says, hey, let me tell you a story.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.080]   We're gonna talk about greed.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.000]   There's a guy, rich man.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.280]   Rich man had this crop, or he had a harvest,
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.260]   and the crop, I mean, it was incredible.
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.620]   This very plentiful harvest, so much so
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.780]   that the guy was like, dude, I can retire early.
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.180]   I mean, I just made it.
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.200]   I've got more than enough to live for the rest of my life,
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.040]   so you know what I'll do?
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.340]   I need to find a place to put it,
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.620]   so I'm gonna tear down my barns, build bigger ones,
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.120]   and kick my feet up and take it easy
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.960]   for the rest of my life.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.060]   I mean, I have arrived.
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.620]   God just blessed me with this incredible crop and harvest.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.380]   And if the story ended there, I mean,
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.500]   what do you think his audience is thinking at this point?
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.060]   I mean, they're thinking, what would you think
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.660]   if you're sitting in an audience and someone's like,
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.860]   okay, let me tell you about, there's a rich man.
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.940]   He's a billionaire, and all of a sudden,
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.540]   his stocks all explode, and God blesses his life,
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.900]   and he's millions and millions.
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.500]   He never has to work ever again.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.820]   They're thinking what you're thinking.
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.740]   Gotta be nice.
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.380]   Oh, man, I would love to be that guy.
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.380]   That's someone to look up to.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.260]   Maybe he's a role model.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.860]   Is this a parable on retirement?
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.540]   And Jesus takes the story in a very different direction.
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:00.780]   Here's what he says next.
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.780]   But God said to him, so he's making this story up,
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.260]   you fool, this very night,
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.060]   your life will be demanded from you.
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:15.620]   Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.940]   This is how it will be with whoever stores up things
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.300]   for themselves, but is not rich towards God.
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.180]   This is the only person or only time in the Bible
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.980]   that God calls someone a fool.
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.660]   And Jesus looks and he says that the person
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.820]   who has really essentially lived the American dream
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.540]   has lived a nightmare according to God.
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.720]   If you live and spend your entire life like this man,
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.100]   pursuing only what is in this life,
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.340]   or pursuing being rich only towards yourself
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.540]   and not towards God, by being rich towards God,
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.940]   Jesus says, or Jesus would elaborate on later,
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.040]   is essentially, there's two ways to be rich towards God.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.140]   Give towards the furthering of God's mission,
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.280]   which is the ministry of Christ,
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.900]   giving out to the world, or giving to the poor.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.620]   He says if you're not rich in that way
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.500]   and you spend your whole life just accumulating stuff
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.180]   for yourself, you are a fool.
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.300]   And he gives us really the first indication
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.700]   or the first look at what greed is and the source of greed.
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:10.980]   The source of greed, if you take notes,
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.420]   you ran to the source of greed is the consumption assumption.
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.860]   Now what does that mean?
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.780]   The source of greed is the consumption assumption.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.660]   Here's what the consumption assumption is,
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:23.660]   is that the idea that assumes everything I earn
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.320]   is mine to consume.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.700]   The assumption consumption, what's your junction,
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.020]   is the idea that everything, it just assumes
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.980]   that hey, everything I earn is mine to consume.
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.660]   A person who's greedy, Jesus would say,
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.340]   is someone who looks at everything that they made last week,
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.300]   everything they made last month,
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.700]   everything that they have in general,
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.320]   and they're like, dude, I work hard, I hate my job,
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.820]   I sit there all day and I punch in numbers.
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.180]   I earned it and I can spend this however I want to.
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.040]   He says that man's a fool when he's greedy.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.460]   Greed, Jesus would say,
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.580]   has nothing to do with how much you have.
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.700]   I mean, there's a myth that hey, only the richest people
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.220]   are greedy, and for only rich people are greedy,
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.020]   Jesus would say, no, there's rich people
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.780]   who are very not greedy,
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.900]   and there's poor people who are greedy.
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.020]   You can make $25,000 and be greedy,
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.300]   and make a million dollars and not be.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.740]   And the inverse is true.
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.340]   Greed has nothing to do with how much you have.
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.980]   It has everything to do with what you do
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.820]   with what you have.
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.940]   And Jesus would say, if you're in this room,
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.900]   if you're listening, and you have bought
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.380]   the assumption consumption, you assume
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.780]   that everything you have has been given to you
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.300]   and he says, you are greedy.
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.460]   You have bought the lie and you have greed in your heart.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.660]   The idea that everything I have, or that assumes
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.660]   everything that I have, everything I've earned is mine.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.220]   God has given for me to consume.
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.260]   He says, you are a fool.
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.660]   And Jesus says, if you live your life this way,
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.540]   where you only pursue things in this life,
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.060]   at the end of your life, you will be like this man.
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.620]   Will you have, he says, this will be the way it is
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.660]   for whoever stores up things for themselves
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.660]   and is not rich towards God.
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:57.060]   He says, the truth of this, that this is that
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.020]   at the end of your life, if you live this way,
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.420]   you will experience what he experienced,
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.060]   total loss, you lose everything.
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.060]   If at the end of this life, all that you've ever
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.620]   spent your life devoting is accumulating
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.540]   and accumulating stuff, at the end of this life,
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.340]   you lose everything, total, it's kinda like,
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.820]   yeah, duh, at the end of this life,
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.340]   if all you have to show is what you did in this life,
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.700]   you never are rich towards God,
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.980]   you never give towards others,
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.620]   you have experienced total loss.
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.540]   Steve Jobs, when Steve Jobs died,
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.900]   he left the exact same amount as everyone else
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.980]   who died any time around him.
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.100]   Everyone else who died that same day,
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.180]   everyone else who died around him, which is everything.
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.660]   And Jesus says, if you spend this life
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.980]   pursuing, getting stuff in this life, you're a fool,
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.880]   if you do that exclusively.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.300]   It's almost like, and here's why I think this is so crucial,
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.900]   is in America, there's like this cultural message
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.980]   that goes out that almost can convince us
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.620]   that the goal of life, or what it looks like to win,
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.260]   is like playing the game of Monopoly.
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.820]   Like, you know how there's multiple types of games,
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.100]   when you play games, and certain games are all about,
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.540]   hey, how much can you acquire?
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.760]   The game of Monopoly, the game of Risk,
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.240]   it's about like, hey, spending the game,
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.900]   the way you win the game, or at the end of the game,
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.900]   the biggest winner is the one who's accumulated
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.840]   and acquired the most stuff.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.320]   Then there's other types of games,
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.180]   where the goal of the game, or the objective,
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.780]   is not to acquire the most stuff,
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.180]   and go around twice, and pass go,
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.320]   the objective of the game is to get rid
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:35.320]   of whatever cards, or whatever tokens that you have,
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.420]   and whoever has given away the most at the end of the game
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.140]   is the one who wins, or whoever is holding onto the most
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:41.980]   is the one who loses.
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:46.980]   Like, we all know these games, Uno, Speed, BS, Go Fish,
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.580]   insert whatever you want in the blank,
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.580]   where the objective of the game,
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.340]   in other words, Uno, if you're playing Uno,
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.780]   does anyone play Uno anymore?
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.460]   If you're playing Uno,
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.020]   it's like you wanna get rid of your cards,
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.060]   you're not like, oh, I'm taking these,
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:57.900]   and I'm taking these, and I'm taking,
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.500]   if you do that, you're like, yeah, you're losing,
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.520]   you don't understand the game,
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.220]   the objective is, hey, I wanna get rid
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.140]   of the cards that I have.
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.380]   Jesus says the Christian life is a whole lot more like Uno
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.380]   than it is Monopoly, and if you spend your life,
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.100]   and I spend my life just chasing, accumulating stuff,
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.140]   the goal is to get rid of it.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.540]   If you are holding things at the end of this life,
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.700]   it's just wasted potential, he would say.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:24.120]   And he looked at this man, and he said, you're a fool.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.460]   And then he goes from the source of greed,
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.940]   which is bought the lie that everything
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.060]   that God has given me is mine,
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.180]   like in the last month,
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.420]   when you look at the way that you've used
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.440]   everything that God has given you, your income,
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:43.300]   whatever your story is, whatever he's put in your hands,
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.900]   have you used it exclusively for yourself,
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.220]   or have you been rich towards God?
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.900]   If you haven't, he would say, there's a good chance
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.460]   you're greedy, and it's hard to see,
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.580]   but that's what it looks like.
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.780]   And then he goes to what greedy leads to,
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.820]   or greediness leads to in the next passage.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.820]   Here's what he says.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:06.000]   Then Jesus said to his disciples,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.380]   so then he turns from the crowd,
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.220]   where he's telling the story,
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.060]   and then he just looks at his 12 boys.
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:15.820]   "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life.
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.900]   "What you will eat, or about your body,
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.440]   "what you will wear, for life is more than food,
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.080]   "and body more than clothes.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.580]   "Consider the ravens.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.260]   "They do not sow or reap.
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.960]   "They have no storeroom or barn, and yet God feeds them.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.720]   "Are you not much more valuable than birds?
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.120]   "Who of you, by worrying, can add a single hour
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.260]   "to your life?
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.000]   "Since you cannot do this very little thing,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.360]   "why do you worry about the rest?
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.240]   "Consider the wildflowers and how they grow.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.640]   "They don't labor or spin, yet I tell you,
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.240]   "not even Solomon in all of his splendor
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.320]   "was dressed like one of these.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.760]   "If that's how God clothes the grass of the field,
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.440]   "which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown in the fire,
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.020]   "how much more will he clothe you,
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.920]   "oh you of little faith?
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.660]   "And do not set your heart on what you will eat,
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.980]   "or drink, or don't worry about it.
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.660]   "For the pagan world runs after all such things,
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.180]   "and your father knows that you need them,
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.620]   "but seek his kingdom first,
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.500]   "and these things will all be given to you as well."
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.200]   It almost seems like, man,
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.860]   did Jesus just change the subject on us?
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:14.820]   And it's clear that he doesn't,
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.220]   if you read back through the text.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.740]   He goes from greed, and the idea of,
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.060]   here's what greediness looks like,
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.020]   here's the source, it's the consumption assumption,
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.380]   hey, whatever I have is mine to consume,
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:28.380]   and he says, "Therefore, do not worry about your life."
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.060]   He immediately draws a connection
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.160]   between the idea of greed and worry,
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.540]   which honestly makes sense when you think about it,
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.620]   because there is a connection between greed and worry.
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.300]   Greed is the idea that I'm worried,
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.340]   hey man, I may not have enough.
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.180]   Worry, especially financial worry,
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.300]   is the idea that I'm worried I will not have enough.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.620]   And Jesus says, "I just want to invite you to a place
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.300]   "where you could experience,
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.020]   "in seeking my kingdom first,
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.980]   "freedom from financial worry."
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.420]   I want you to know that there is a relationship
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.520]   between the greed that you have and between worry,
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.500]   and I want you to invite,
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.660]   or I want to invite you to a place
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.420]   where you can experience freedom from financial worry.
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.340]   'Cause here's what I know about you,
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.180]   'cause I know it about me,
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.620]   and I know it really, just 'cause study after study shows it,
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.420]   one of the top things that people in general
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.640]   are worried about is money.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.620]   Money and future spouse would probably be the two things
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.300]   that inside of this room all of us are worried about,
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.240]   or those of us who aren't married are worried about.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.700]   And Jesus says, "Hey, I just want you to know,
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.380]   "when it comes to the topic of greed,
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.520]   "there's a freedom from greed and a freedom from worry
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.680]   "that you can experience if you will learn
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.160]   "to put or prioritize my kingdom first,
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.620]   "my kingdom above your kingdom."
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.760]   And he looked out into an audience
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.040]   that unlike the worries that we have,
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.220]   was not worried about our wants,
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.280]   which is really as Americans,
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.300]   that's kind of what we worry about.
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.860]   Like, "Hey, will I get to upgrade my phone?
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.760]   "And can I get a better car?
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.600]   "And where am I gonna live someday?
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.540]   "And my kids go to college?"
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.380]   We don't worry about like,
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.460]   "I don't know if I'm gonna get a meal later today.
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.840]   "I don't know if there's gonna be water for me.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.940]   "I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight."
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.500]   That may be the case for very few of us
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.060]   inside of the room, but by and large,
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.080]   most of us aren't like,
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.960]   "Gosh, I'm just storing up those Arca bottles
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.380]   "'cause I'm worried I'm never gonna have a drink again."
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.000]   Most of us worry about the wants we have.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.940]   He looks into an audience that's worried about like,
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.880]   "Jesus, our clothes are wearing out."
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.040]   And he says, "There is a place
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.640]   "that God wants to bring you to,
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.660]   "wherein, seeking his kingdom first,
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:21.200]   "you will experience freedom from worry."
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.240]   Freedom from worry.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.000]   The side effect of greed is anxiety.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.160]   The second point that we have tonight
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.840]   that Jesus leads us to in his teachings
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.120]   is that there's a side effect that comes from greed,
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.460]   and it is anxiety.
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.520]   And here's how I think, generally speaking,
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.800]   like anxiety plays out for most of us
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.820]   inside of our life.
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.600]   Is for those of us who are financially anxious,
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.200]   because it is related to our wants,
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.480]   and I think there's legitimately people
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.240]   who are financially anxious inside of the room,
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.820]   it generally happens, here's like the road
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.400]   that we experience anxiety on,
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.080]   is that you make a certain amount of money,
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.040]   you make $40,000, you make $80,000,
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.560]   you make 50,000, whatever it is,
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.640]   and regardless of kinda how much you make,
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.120]   the line that you draw for your spending
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.080]   is right up, and sometimes even right above,
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.440]   whatever salary that you make, or whatever I make.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.440]   I mean, it just goes without saying,
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.180]   the average American kinda does this,
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.340]   where hey, if I make 50,000,
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:15.600]   I end up spending almost exactly up to $50,000.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.160]   And so, of course I have anxiety,
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.880]   because it's an anxiety-filled place
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.960]   to live at the limit of my money.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.840]   And Jesus says, if you allow greed,
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.320]   or excessive consumption, because again,
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.640]   I think there's resistance to being like,
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.760]   dude, I'm not greedy.
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.400]   If you are someone who is spending
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.960]   every single dollar that you have
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.460]   that's coming into your hands,
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.940]   you are someone that Jesus would say
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.720]   is being driven by excessive consumption,
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.640]   and of course you're gonna experience anxiety.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.340]   And if you will learn to seek my kingdom first,
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.940]   you will have less anxiety.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.760]   And I think, let's just talk real.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.180]   Inside of the room right now,
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.660]   the emotional response to this is,
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.620]   dude, are you kidding me?
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.720]   We're talking about money right now,
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.460]   and you're telling me I need to put God first,
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.820]   and be rich towards God, and give towards his kingdom,
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.740]   and seek his kingdom first,
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.260]   and I am barely making it.
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.460]   That sounds great for you up there, preacher boy,
[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.260]   but pretty much all this is going in this year,
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.180]   and out this year, and I'm like,
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.980]   really, you got the God wants my money again,
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.260]   and the church, what?
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.460]   This place feels pretty nice, and I'm barely making it.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.340]   And so I've got like a car lease that I have,
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.780]   I have an apartment that I have to pay for,
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.380]   I have bills that I have to pay,
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.480]   and I'm like, I'm drowning over here,
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.820]   and you're telling me that in the midst of everything
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.300]   that I have on my expenditures,
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.780]   I'm supposed to somehow be like,
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.820]   man, prioritize God first, and make sure that you,
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:36.740]   when it comes to your money,
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.220]   you're spending towards his kingdom, above and beyond.
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.940]   That sounds amazing, but there's only one problem.
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.300]   I can't afford it.
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.980]   And so if you will just talk to God,
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.500]   or maybe God, you can just hear me now,
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.780]   and you'll give me more money,
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.460]   I would love to be generous towards you and to your kingdom.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.860]   I would love to give you money,
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.180]   and seek your kingdom first, and prioritize it above mine,
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.700]   but right now, I just can't do it,
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.980]   because I don't have enough money.
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.180]   And Jesus would say, the problem is,
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.060]   and you're not gonna believe me,
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.900]   that it's not a lack of money.
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.940]   It's not that you need more money.
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.580]   It's that you have to put his kingdom first.
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.280]   And the truth and reality, even study after study shows,
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.620]   if you were to get more money,
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.860]   you're like, hey, I make 50 grand.
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.380]   If I made 70 grand, I would love to be generous towards God
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.620]   and put his kingdom first.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.900]   Study after study shows that whenever someone
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.900]   goes from 50 to 70, their lifestyle just moves up with it.
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:26.740]   It's almost like this.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.740]   Like, here would be the illustration
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.460]   that may help bring some clarity to it.
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.900]   Whenever it comes to, like, our spending,
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.340]   let's say this is our income.
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.380]   So whatever your income is, if it's $20,000, $50,000,
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.220]   let's say it's $30,000.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.260]   Generally speaking, when it comes to what's in,
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.940]   what we're using our income towards,
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.000]   and if we have, over here, it's things for ourself.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.380]   This would be your rent.
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:47.740]   This would be your cell phone.
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.940]   This would be a combination kind of of needs,
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.580]   and of, you know, let's just be honest, wants.
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.140]   This is like, hey, I, you know, have a car.
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.340]   I have insurance to pay for.
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.940]   This is a, I got in a wreck last week,
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.060]   and I just have all these different things
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.540]   that I'm mounting up, and I'm trying to pay for,
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.060]   and this is my Netflix subscription.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.420]   Let's just insert any of those things
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:08.060]   that don't fill in giving towards God and His kingdom.
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.640]   And so really, when it comes to our income,
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.460]   the reality is most of us feel like,
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.020]   dude, I'm doing everything I can,
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.620]   and it's overflowing right now.
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.620]   Like, I'm not just drowning in my own income.
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.260]   I'm reaching into the future.
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.140]   I'm not just drowning in trying to make ends meet
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.020]   with the income that I have.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.380]   Like, I'm having, I have $3,000 in credit card debt.
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.660]   I don't have enough, and you're coming over here,
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.200]   and if this represents God, and you're like,
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.640]   dude, you should really try to like jam those in there
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.680]   a little bit more.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.980]   It's just not gonna happen, okay?
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:43.240]   And what Jesus is saying is that if you will learn
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.460]   to prioritize my kingdom first, what do I mean by that?
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.340]   Do I just mean, hey, if you will tithe
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.100]   and have an automatic withdrawal,
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.020]   then all of your money problems are gonna go away?
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:57.020]   No, if you will learn how to prioritize my kingdom first,
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:01.060]   it's going to shape everything that you put,
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.740]   or every other part of the income that you use.
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.420]   So whenever your life posture is,
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.500]   hey, God, at the end of the day,
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.900]   my life is here to seek your kingdom first, not my kingdom.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.300]   My life, my money, everything is for your kingdom.
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.460]   Jesus says when you begin to live that way,
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.400]   begin to think that way, begin to use your money that way,
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.540]   something begins to change,
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.380]   and it will then become a filter
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.620]   that the posture of your life and your heart,
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.620]   'cause you're like, I'm here,
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.820]   and again, I'm not saying tithe,
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.020]   and I'm not saying, hey, if you give,
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.460]   all your money problems are gonna away.
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.300]   What I'm saying is Jesus is saying
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.100]   if you begin to seek my kingdom first,
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.840]   you will have less anxiety
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.720]   because you will not spend all the way up to the limit.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.200]   And again, I'm not saying if you tithe,
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.380]   you won't spend all the way to the limit.
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.820]   There's plenty of people who tithe
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:46.940]   who are terrible with money
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.480]   and max out their credit cards every single month.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.560]   People who begin to say, God, everything I have is yours.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.180]   And so I'm seeing through the filter of your kingdom come.
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.620]   I'm seeking your kingdom with my life.
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.100]   And so every decision as it relates
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.340]   to what purse I'm gonna buy,
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.180]   what car I'm gonna drive, where I'm gonna live,
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.220]   everything I'm gonna be,
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.180]   everything's gonna be touched and impacted
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.700]   by the fact that above everything else,
[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.640]   I'm here to seek your kingdom.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.860]   And that may look like you giving $1 a million dollars.
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.000]   I don't know what that's gonna look like,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.140]   but if you can come to a place
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.980]   where you truly, Jesus says, do that,
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.900]   you'll have less anxiety, you'll have less worry,
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.420]   you'll have more money and more margin,
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:29.740]   and you will experience freedom from greed.
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:34.300]   Or you can live like everyone else does
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.740]   and you will max yourself out
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:36.580]   and you live in a culture
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.100]   that is trying to get you to max out.
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.300]   I mean, think about the credit card industry
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.940]   where they're like, hey, let's reach into June
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.340]   and get it on loan and you can use the money.
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:46.620]   You're good for it, right?
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:50.300]   And you'll be in golden handcuffs until you pay it off.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.700]   And Jesus is saying, I want you to be at a place
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.300]   where you put my kingdom first,
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.540]   you put the rocks of being rich towards God in,
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.960]   and everything else will be impacted
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.520]   in your life and in mine.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:06.300]   And if not, you will experience the side effect of greed,
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:11.300]   that excessive desire for more, which is anxiety.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.380]   Anxiety.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.380]   He then goes into really the clearest solution
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.820]   as it relates to greed in verse 32.
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:25.620]   Do not be afraid, little flock.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.800]   Oh, it's just funny.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.420]   (laughing)
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.900]   What are we, pastor?
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:36.700]   For your father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.580]   So he says, seek first his kingdom
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:41.580]   and then know as you do so, don't be afraid.
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.540]   And here's what that looks like.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.340]   So sell your possessions, give them to the poor,
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.300]   provide for yourselves purses or money
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.740]   for yourselves that will not wear out,
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.540]   treasure in heaven that will never fail,
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.020]   where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.300]   For wherever your treasure is,
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.180]   there your heart will be also.
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:02.180]   Jesus says that greed ultimately can be resolved
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.900]   and is resolved, there is a solution for it.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.340]   But it comes whenever you begin to generously give
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.000]   towards God's kingdom, something happens in your heart.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.300]   Your heart begins to shift.
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.820]   He just said, hey, wherever your treasure is,
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:15.860]   your heart's gonna be there also.
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:16.820]   We live in a culture that says,
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:17.780]   put your money where your mouth is.
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.780]   Jesus says, you will put your money where your heart is.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.860]   And your heart will shift.
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.660]   There's something where greed begins to be remedied
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.960]   and a solution is given for greed
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.860]   whenever you begin to give and be rich towards God.
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.260]   Our third idea from this text
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.720]   is the solution to greed is storing in eternity.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.580]   Jesus just said, hey, look, I'm telling you,
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.040]   the God who is there in heaven
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.620]   wants to give to anyone who will trust him.
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.480]   Anyone who's willing to invest in his kingdom,
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.140]   he wants to generously give it to you, little flock.
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.240]   And so invest, sell your stuff, give it to the poor,
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.080]   give towards God's kingdom
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.120]   and store up for yourselves treasure that will never fade,
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.340]   that will never wear out.
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.980]   It's the safest place you can use and invest
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.580]   any money that you have, he says to his crowd.
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.140]   And he would say to you and he would say to me.
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.780]   Essentially, Jesus is given like insider trading information
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.940]   and this life, you go to jail for it.
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.500]   Jesus is saying, and the next, it's A-okay
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.700]   and I'm telling you, you want to go all in with your money.
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:21.340]   Here's why I think most of us don't.
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:26.260]   Most of us don't really like radically give
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.020]   or have a posture of like, dude, whatever I have,
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.220]   even if I don't have very much right now,
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.480]   I made $1,000 this month, but I really wanna make sure
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.300]   that I'm investing something in eternity.
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.820]   At the end of the day, the reason why we don't
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.440]   is not because we don't have enough money.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.500]   And that's kind of like the felt need
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.700]   or the smoke screen we hide behind.
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.580]   The reason why we don't is faith.
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.380]   I mean, that's the reason why I don't.
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.100]   Like if I really believe like Jesus,
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.180]   anything you tell me, like any dollar that I give,
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.940]   anything that I sacrifice for your kingdom,
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:51.540]   there's gonna be an eternal reward
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.920]   that awaits me forever and ever.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.020]   I mean, if I really, if that really gripped
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.920]   and I was without any doubt convinced of it,
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.280]   how would that change the way that I spend?
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.860]   I'm a pastor.
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.940]   And Jesus says, man, the moment you,
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.180]   the more you begin to believe that,
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.860]   the more it's gonna change and shape
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.080]   because if you will come to really grasping that,
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.340]   you will understand that it is the safest place
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:15.220]   that you can put your money.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.780]   Here's why I know that it's a moment of faith.
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:19.380]   I mean, think about, let me use a dumb illustration.
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.540]   So most likely if you're in this room,
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:22.780]   you've heard about Bitcoin.
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.760]   Bitcoin, anyone know what Bitcoin is?
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.140]   Okay, Bitcoin, apparently I'm the only one.
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.440]   So let me educate everybody.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.100]   Bitcoin apparently is like this sort of cryptocurrency
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.500]   that sounds like it's out of Star Wars
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.780]   and it's some sort of, I don't even fully grasp it,
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.260]   I won't even attempt to because somebody's
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.180]   gonna come up after and be like,
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:41.500]   actually, sure, there's actually a statistical analysis.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:47.500]   Anyways, okay, so Bitcoin is somehow this cryptocurrency
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:51.140]   or people think, oh man, this could be a currency
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.540]   of the future, it's a one world currency.
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:54.940]   I don't personally own any Bitcoin,
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.420]   this is not a sponsorship ploy.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:00.500]   It is this money or sense of currency
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.840]   that some people think, oh man, this is the future,
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.260]   you should invest in this, it's gonna explode.
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.780]   It's the future of money.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.420]   If I really believed or if you really believed,
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.220]   if someone came from the future and they said,
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.420]   they came and they were like, dude, hey,
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.220]   I'm from the future, I'm the future you,
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.340]   I need to talk to you about Bitcoin
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.460]   in a very short amount of time,
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.620]   all American money will be worthless.
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.340]   Literally, it'll just be what it is,
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.060]   little green pieces of paper with dead presidents on it.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.740]   No one will use it for anything.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.100]   Bitcoin is the future.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.060]   You want to go all in right now on Bitcoin.
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.900]   I'm telling you, I'm promising you,
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.260]   if you really were like, man, this guy's wearing
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.300]   a shiny suit, he's from the future, I guess,
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.060]   and I really think that this is gonna happen,
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.500]   Bitcoin is gonna be the future if you really,
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.580]   like you were convinced of it, follow me,
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:46.460]   what would you do?
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.500]   You'd go all in with Bitcoin.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.380]   I mean, if you were convinced that like,
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.820]   all of the money in my bank account
[00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.340]   is gonna be like monopoly money.
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.340]   And Bitcoin is really, I mean, I should trade
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.300]   that stuff that is losing its value
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.480]   and not gonna be worth anything and go all in
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.840]   on what I know 'cause I have future information
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:08.460]   is going to be worth exponentially more.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.580]   I mean, of course you would.
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:11.320]   You'd be like crazy if not.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:17.200]   Jesus is saying that that is what's gonna happen.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:21.300]   And right now, you need to eat, you need to live indoors,
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.100]   you need to have all those different needs,
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.660]   if you will, met, but there's gonna come a day
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.540]   much sooner than you and I think where everything
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.540]   that is passed through your hands will either be something
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.180]   that you stewarded for an eternal reward
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:34.780]   or it will be something you're just left holding
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.660]   in the end and lose and me too.
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:42.420]   And this is not a, man, the church here,
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.940]   we're gonna ask and pass a plate at the end
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.300]   'cause we need your money.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:49.100]   God doesn't need your money, we don't need your money
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.460]   and not because like, we're like, dude,
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.900]   we got a vault back there, it's huge, it's unbelievable.
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.500]   I mean, we're, not because of that,
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.200]   because I wanna make sure inside of this room,
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:01.200]   nobody hides behind the smoke screen of thinking,
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.640]   oh my gosh, the church just wants my money again
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.800]   and you use that to talk yourself out
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.720]   of the best financial advice you could receive,
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:13.020]   which is from Jesus saying, invest in my kingdom.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.220]   Every other kingdom that you invest in is fading away.
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.480]   It will not last.
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:24.160]   The solution for greed is investing,
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.860]   it's storing up in eternity.
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.440]   So here's what I'm gonna press.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:33.120]   If you are a member of a church, not this church,
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.040]   any church, if you are a member, you're all in,
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:36.960]   I'm not talking to non-believers,
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.240]   I'm not talking to people who are like, you know,
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.640]   still trying to figure out the faith thing
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.680]   or just, you know, just starting to take steps
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.400]   in that direction, if you are a member of a church,
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:49.100]   you should be giving regularly somewhere to Christ's kingdom.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.580]   You should be giving somewhere.
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.760]   If you, whatever home church you're at,
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:53.600]   I'm not telling you to give it here,
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.760]   if you go to another church, you should give to that church
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.520]   that all of us, if you're a follower of Christ
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.880]   and you're all in with Jesus,
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.620]   you should be connected to a local body
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.320]   and you should be contributing there
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.320]   or contributing to Christ's mission in some sense.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.640]   So if you're like, can I give to a missionary?
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.560]   Sure, give to a missionary, give to anything
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.920]   that's gonna spread the mission of Christ
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.420]   or Jesus says, you can give directly to the poor.
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:16.800]   That you and I should be regularly contributing
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.960]   and giving towards God's kingdom.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.600]   What do I mean by regularly giving towards God's kingdom?
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.000]   With regularity, you should be giving
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.140]   towards God's kingdom.
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.160]   That means every two weeks, every week,
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.600]   whatever that looks like, maybe it's annually,
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.480]   maybe it's quarterly, I don't know what,
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.480]   you know, how that would work for you.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:37.200]   But I know that as I was preparing this week,
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.640]   I felt a check because I don't think
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.560]   that I've waived this banner hard enough
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.480]   for young adults here.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:48.160]   And I felt like I was not putting in front of them
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:52.440]   the best investment advice that they could ever have
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.860]   because I was like, man, I just don't have much money,
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.680]   I don't wanna create insecurity and create people
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.600]   being like, oh, I guess church wants my money.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.240]   And I needed to repent because it's not loving to you,
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.120]   it's not loving to anyone who claims the name of Jesus
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.960]   to say, look, there's an eternal reward.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.800]   Anything that you give in this life,
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.040]   anything that you sacrifice will be something
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.480]   that forever and ever and ever,
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.320]   Christ is saying you'll be repaid a hundredfold.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.880]   I mean, that's crazy.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.960]   And for me to hide behind like, gosh,
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.280]   I just don't wanna give people the wrong impression
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.200]   is stupid and wrong on my part.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.320]   And so you do with that whatever you want to.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.480]   Jesus says, you invest in my kingdom,
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.520]   it's the only place that's safe.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:35.480]   Bitcoin's not, the American dollar's not,
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.280]   whatever Apple stock, Bezos' stock,
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.960]   none of it is gonna last.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.960]   The only kingdom that will last is mine.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.020]   And so if you are a believer,
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.400]   I want to not challenge or encourage you or guilt you,
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.080]   I want to give you like the best advice you're gonna get.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.200]   You should be investing in the only kingdom
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.960]   that lasts regularly.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.080]   And so if you have a home church,
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.560]   I would incredibly encourage you,
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.920]   you should be investing in your home church.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.840]   And Jesus says, you will never regret it.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:12.160]   How much should I be investing?
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.840]   I think the answer is probably based on what I read,
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.120]   you tell me what you read,
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.960]   how much do you wanna have in heaven?
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.640]   I mean, at the end of the day,
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.600]   it's not, is it dollar for dollar?
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.880]   I don't think so, 'cause Jesus says with the widow's mite,
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.960]   hey, this woman who gave her one coin,
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.040]   she only had one, gave more than everybody else.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.800]   And so there's something, clearly Jesus says like,
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.320]   dude, if you only have one coin,
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.760]   like you're in here like, I only have one coin,
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.360]   Jesus is like, dude, you should go all in,
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.160]   'cause you get 80 times more than any of the rest of us.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.560]   And I'm so angry, I'm throwing my papers up here.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.920]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.720]   You guys just talk amongst yourselves for a second here.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.200]   This is gonna be really good.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.000]   So you should be given regularly.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:38:00.280]   Man, it's always terrible, you kill a moment, Shane.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.320]   It's the worst.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:06.120]   To some ministry or to some church.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.960]   Should I give if I'm in debt?
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.800]   If I have student loans?
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.280]   Man, I don't know, you should have a community group
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.320]   around you who helps walk you through that.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.960]   Where should I give?
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.960]   Towards Christ's kingdom, either a ministry or a church,
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.760]   or towards directly towards the poor.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.120]   Jesus said it's ultimately an issue
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.320]   if you're unwilling to give,
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.640]   your hands are gripped around it,
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.160]   which I know a lot of you guys are gonna leave here tonight,
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.960]   you're not gonna do anything with what I'm saying.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.840]   And you're gonna miss out.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.080]   And you're gonna continue investing
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.200]   and building your own kingdom.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.160]   And Jesus says, man, the problem ultimately
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.680]   is a matter of the heart.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.520]   And the good news is, the more you give,
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.920]   the more greed's grip gets released.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.320]   It's just something that happens.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.880]   'Cause where your treasure is, your heart will follow.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.480]   The source of greed is the idea of assuming
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.120]   that everything I have is mine to consume.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.360]   What greed is gonna lead to in your life,
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:57.400]   and the reason why many of you are experiencing it right now
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.240]   is anxiety.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:02.320]   And the solution for greed, the freedom from the grip
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.080]   of greed comes from giving, from storing up in eternity.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.080]   Jesus would say.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.240]   I'll close here.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.160]   When I was younger, my family,
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:17.160]   I had cousins that had a condo in Seaside, in Destin,
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.480]   in Florida, and we would go.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.000]   And I remember staying at the condo,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.920]   and I was like seven years old, and you wake up,
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.040]   and there are all kinds of different fun things
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.360]   about the condo that I won't go into.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.560]   But one thing that you do, I had three siblings,
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.440]   and so of course, if you are on a beach,
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.880]   and you're not ever really at the beach,
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.800]   you run down, if you're like, oh, I'm gonna run down.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.120]   And you're like, oh, I'm gonna run down.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.440]   And if you're not ever really at the beach,
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.800]   you run down, if you're a little kid,
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   and you begin to do what?
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.840]   You begin to build sandcastles.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.360]   And so you take whatever kind of tools and resources,
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.400]   and this cup, and this bucket, and these knives,
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.200]   and anything that was at the house, this plate,
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.440]   and you begin to build whatever sort of ultimate sandcastle
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.280]   that you can.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.480]   You're building a moat around,
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.040]   and your imagination's going wild,
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.200]   so there's fireproof alligators in the moat
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.720]   that are driving around, and you're pouring water in,
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.640]   and you're looking at your siblings,
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.560]   and you're kicking over their tower,
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.000]   and you're just building it,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.120]   and you spend the entire day building
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.680]   this incredible, elaborate sandcastle,
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.360]   this incredible thing, this home.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:15.680]   And then what happens the next day is you go to sleep,
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.100]   and because to make a sandcastle,
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.000]   it's gotta be close somewhat to the water
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.720]   in order to get the right consistency,
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.360]   and keep things compact.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.460]   You go outside, and it's gone.
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:32.000]   'Cause the tide comes in, and it sweeps it away.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.200]   And you do it again, and it doesn't last.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:42.240]   What Jesus says is that your life,
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:47.300]   if all that you're spending it on is this life,
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.440]   you are building a sandcastle,
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.440]   and it's gonna be here today, and it will be gone tomorrow.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:57.880]   And just as crazy as it would be for someone to go out
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.220]   and be like, this is where I'm gonna sleep,
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.200]   I'm making this sandcastle,
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.920]   I'm putting all of this energy into it,
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.240]   Jesus would say, you're a fool,
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:09.040]   and you're a sandcastle king, or a sandcastle queen,
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.740]   but you are wasting your life.
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.460]   But if you will seek the only kingdom,
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.360]   it's not your kingdom, it's not my kingdom,
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.480]   and at the end of the day, you and I,
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.260]   that's the fact, as silly, as dumb
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.320]   as that illustration may be,
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.700]   you'll be a sandcastle king,
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.100]   or you'll live for his kingdom, that's the truth.
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:28.480]   And Jesus says, will you invest in my kingdom,
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.420]   it's the only one that will last,
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.120]   with your money, with your time,
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:36.440]   will you put me first, and prioritize me,
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:41.360]   or are you gonna be a sandcastle king or queen?
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.680]   Let me pray.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:57.600]   Father, I need your help as much as anyone in this room.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:02.600]   I live in one of the most materialistic cities in our world,
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.440]   and every single day, I feel the tension and the lie,
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.220]   and just the message fighting from my heart
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.980]   that I don't have enough, I need more,
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:12.540]   I need more stuff, I need more money,
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.180]   like that would fix my problems,
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:17.460]   would you help me, God, to not waste my life
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:22.460]   building sandcastles, building my own kingdom,
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.980]   consumed about where my kids are gonna go to school,
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.040]   what house I'm gonna live in,
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.340]   what kind of car I'm gonna drive,
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:28.900]   how much I'm gonna have in my 401k,
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.900]   how much I'm making, and not waste my life, God.
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:35.100]   And I sit before a room of young adults
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:38.460]   who honestly, many of them are wasting their life,
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:43.020]   and they're running after any kingdom but yours,
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.340]   or they're running after their own, let's be honest.
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:49.340]   And the same thing is fighting from my heart, Lord,
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.920]   would you help that to not be the case today,
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.460]   but even if it isn't today,
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:53.940]   I'll run after my kingdom tomorrow,
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.800]   so God, we need your help, Lord.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.500]   (gentle music)
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:04.040]   Would you please help us to see with an eternal perspective
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.520]   and store treasures in heaven,
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:09.080]   and be radically generous, Lord,
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:14.960]   and trust that as you say,
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.200]   anything given for your kingdom
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:21.800]   will have eternal reward,
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.960]   and anything held onto will be eternal regret,
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.840]   Father, thank you for dying in our place,
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.800]   for giving your life,
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.960]   for being the God who was rich,
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.440]   who for our sake became poor.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.320]   You are worthy of every dollar we make,
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.120]   everything that we do, every breath that we breathe,
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.200]   every song that we sing,
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.520]   and we worship you now in song, amen.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:52.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
