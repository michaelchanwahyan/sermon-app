1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:26,560
 - Well good evening everyone.

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,460
 Not only that's right here in this very room,

4
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,420
 but I just found out today that there are 11 groups now.

5
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,720
 We're up to 11 groups that are meeting

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,880
 in other parts of the world right now together.

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,180
 Not to mention everyone who's listening individually,

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,980
 whether you're driving, walking,

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,200
 wherever you are right now,

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,580
 listening to The Porch and being a part of this thing.

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,420
 We're so glad you're here.

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,240
 My name is Garrett.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,500
 I get a chance to help out on staff here.

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,520
 I was at The Porch Fort Worth

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,900
 for the last four amazing years,

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,740
 so special shout out to my Fort Worth fam.

17
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,860
 I'm gonna be helping out

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,780
 with the Awaken Conference going forward.

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,620
 If you don't know what Awaken is,

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,540
 you should press pause right now and go to awaken.live.

21
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,680
 That's not for you right here in the room,

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,800
 but if you're online or you're listening, awaken.live.

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,000
 It's gonna be amazing next May.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,260
 You can check it out.

25
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,160
 Let's get started here tonight.

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,400
 Hey, are any of you diehards ready for Christmas already?

27
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,260
 (audience cheering)

28
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,440
 I'm offended at all of you.

29
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,620
 I think Christmas belongs between the day

30
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,900
 after Thanksgiving and December 31st.

31
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,660
 (audience cheering)

32
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,100
 I'm just gonna, I know I just divided the room terribly,

33
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,220
 but however you feel about the upcoming holiday,

34
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,700
 whether it should be celebrated now

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,820
 or in its proper place, just so you know where I stand,

36
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,620
 however you feel about that,

37
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,300
 one thing is going on right now,

38
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,020
 and it is that little people, children,

39
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,980
 are gonna be finding out

40
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,860
 that Santa Claus is actually not real,

41
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,280
 and that's very unfortunate.

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,380
 For some of you, sorry to let you know in this moment,

43
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,280
 I know, for some of you,

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,920
 this is like your least favorite childhood memory

45
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,940
 where you found out that something you thought

46
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,180
 was so real and so important was actually a myth,

47
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,020
 like it wasn't real.

48
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,480
 Some of you had this done really well.

49
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,980
 You had like a gentle parent.

50
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,660
 You know, they like sit you down,

51
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,500
 and they're like, "Listen, honey,

52
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,860
 "we need to tell you something because we love you."

53
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,420
 You know, and some people break it to you

54
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,060
 really, really well, and then some of you,

55
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,940
 more likely, had a know-it-all classmate

56
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,980
 whose parents had had that meeting with them,

57
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,320
 and then they come in and just crash your worldview

58
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,260
 right there with just no sympathy about it whatsoever,

59
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,420
 but however you found out about it, it is never fun.

60
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,420
 It is never fun to believe that something is real,

61
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,200
 that something's worthy of your hope,

62
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,760
 that something is worthy of your trust and your pursuit,

63
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,940
 and then all of a sudden, it kind of starts to crash down.

64
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,060
 I had it happen to me nearly recently

65
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,140
 after I bought my girlfriend, now wife,

66
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,980
 a diamond ring to propose.

67
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,480
 One of my friends said, "Hey, I bought my wife's diamond ring

68
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,980
 "from the same place, and I found out it was fake."

69
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,500
 I said, "Oh, no, Santa Claus is real.

70
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,740
 "You better believe it.

71
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,100
 "There's no way that," you know, and it turned out,

72
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,420
 thankfully, that it was actually not true,

73
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,260
 but it shook me.

74
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,700
 You know, there's something disorienting and kind of crazy

75
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,020
 about feeling like, oh, man, the thing I thought

76
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,300
 was so real is actually a myth,

77
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,080
 and there is a myth in our culture,

78
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,420
 a very well-known myth that our society

79
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,800
 was actually built on, and it is this myth,

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,900
 that more money equals more happiness.

81
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,140
 The truth is is that this myth

82
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,820
 that more money equals more happiness

83
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,780
 is older than the songs we grew up with, though.

84
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,900
 Our entire society was actually based on this idea,

85
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,620
 that the more happiness you have,

86
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,340
 or the more money you have, that your happiness

87
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,440
 is actually gonna increase with it,

88
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,420
 that life, liberty, and the pursuit of what?

89
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,540
 - Happiness. - Is a way of life,

90
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,020
 and make no mistake about it, we would say

91
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,140
 that money is intricately tied to happiness,

92
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,660
 and maybe the graph, if you could draw it,

93
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,620
 would look a little something like this,

94
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,260
 that relationship between these two things

95
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,740
 would work a little bit like that,

96
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,580
 that the farther you push that way into money,

97
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,860
 the more money you can get, the more paycheck you can get,

98
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,820
 that your happiness will climb with it,

99
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,980
 and what's interesting is that our society

100
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,100
 has actually succeeded at that.

101
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,000
 I mean, if you look at the aggregate culture

102
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,400
 of the United States as it relates

103
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
 to the rest of world history,

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,120
 yes, there are parts of America that are disadvantaged,

105
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,800
 no, not everyone in America seems to have

106
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,960
 the same fair opportunity that we boast about,

107
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,520
 however, if you look at the numbers

108
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,860
 compared to the rest of the world,

109
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,360
 we are in the middle of a 200-year experiment,

110
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,840
 and we are richer than any society that's ever lived.

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,280
 Have you ever thought about that?

112
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,920
 None of us feel rich.

113
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,860
 We don't seem to feel it.

114
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,700
 You're like, where is it?

115
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,200
 I don't have it, but none of us feel it,

116
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,080
 but the truth is that at a national level,

117
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,100
 at a societal level, we are the richest society

118
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,380
 in the history of the world.

119
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,280
 However, we're also the most depressed.

120
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,760
 We're the most disillusioned.

121
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,900
 We're the most disappointed.

122
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,980
 It's as if instead of pushing farther out here,

123
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,980
 farther than any society has ever gone before,

124
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,440
 instead of finding some kind of permanent happiness

125
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,840
 or contentment, all we find is another exhausting goal.

126
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,780
 We're the most medicated, the most mentally medicated

127
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,500
 country in the history of the world.

128
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,340
 To the rest of the world,

129
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,660
 America might look like Disneyland,

130
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,020
 but we're the kids who are sad at Disneyland,

131
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,420
 which will show you that not everything

132
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,380
 that you need psychologically can happen

133
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,180
 through what you can have materially.

134
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,420
 It's as if somewhere out here,

135
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,780
 even though we've pushed this experiment,

136
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,840
 this American dream as far as it can go,

137
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,720
 it seems that there's not happiness out here,

138
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,020
 but as compelling as that might be,

139
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,420
 for some of you, I know that this happens closer to home.

140
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,980
 For some of you, this pursuit of money broke up your family

141
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,420
 because a parent decided, you know what,

142
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,220
 more money is gonna equal more happiness,

143
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,540
 and the truth is they took a job

144
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,220
 or they took a place where they had to travel

145
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,540
 and it didn't lead to more happiness,

146
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,580
 at least not for you.

147
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,620
 For some of you, this is the thing

148
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,180
 that's kind of been the steering wheel of your life.

149
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,620
 You know, this decides where you go.

150
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,620
 You know, where is the money?

151
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,620
 Where's the paycheck?

152
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,860
 For some of you, this is how you ended up

153
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,860
 in a Texas city, you know?

154
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,220
 Your friends are like, why'd you go there?

155
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,780
 Was there mountains?

156
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,220
 No, no mountains, you know?

157
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,220
 Was there a beach?

158
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,420
 Not, no, not really, you know?

159
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,820
 Well, why are you there?

160
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,780
 And you're like, well, if I'm,

161
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,740
 you wouldn't say this out loud,

162
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,500
 but the truth is you're here to start your empire

163
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,140
 and make money and that is gonna make you feel good inside.

164
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,620
 The pursuit of money and happiness

165
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,460
 is naturally linked in our mind,

166
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,140
 and what I wanna do is I just wanna shoot you straight.

167
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,980
 I have to admit, I am susceptible to buying into this.

168
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,860
 I'm not immune to this.

169
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,140
 It's not like you get into ministry

170
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,660
 and you just want money less.

171
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,980
 You may have money less,

172
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,980
 but you will not want money less

173
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,820
 when you get into ministry.

174
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,460
 That is a normal part of human existence.

175
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,020
 I have to, I just wanna admit that up front.

176
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,260
 I don't wanna be a hypocrite up here.

177
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,140
 I like opportunity that money offers.

178
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,400
 I like freedom that money offers.

179
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,380
 I like stuff.

180
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,820
 I especially tend to like vacations.

181
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,140
 I mean, I can get into a vacation in a hurry,

182
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,300
 and my wife's like, what happened to the bank account?

183
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,140
 I'm like, I don't know.

184
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,960
 I blacked out.

185
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,800
 We're going to Mexico.

186
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,620
 Praise God, you know?

187
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,460
 It's gonna be great.

188
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,380
 (congregation laughing)

189
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,500
 And so I just wanna tell you,

190
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,340
 I'm not totally free from this.

191
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,180
 I don't profess to be,

192
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,620
 but what I do wanna do is I wanna introduce you

193
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,060
 to two different people in the scripture tonight.

194
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,060
 They represent two perspectives

195
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,900
 about how happiness and money relate.

196
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,540
 They represent two future options for you.

197
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,020
 And I believe scripturally, you can be the judge.

198
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,220
 I believe scripturally that you are actually going to turn in

199
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,660
 to one of these two people that you're gonna meet tonight.

200
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,180
 Jesus interacted with them.

201
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,980
 And as you see them face to face,

202
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,820
 you may see a little bit of yourself.

203
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,580
 And here's the thing.

204
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,500
 None of us get to pick our list of options.

205
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,400
 I do believe biblically, and you can be the judge,

206
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,220
 that we get to be one of these two people.

207
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,220
 We are going to turn into one of these people.

208
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,620
 We are going to adopt their perspective about money.

209
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,940
 One of the two.

210
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,420
 We can't choose the list of options,

211
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,340
 but we can choose our choice.

212
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,420
 We can make our decision.

213
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,820
 And so I'd love for you to meet these people.

214
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,140
 And the first is found in the book of Mark.

215
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,340
 So Mark is an accurate biography of Jesus.

216
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:42,340
 It's a story of Jesus where Mark saw via an eyewitness

217
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,160
 exactly what Jesus had said and done

218
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,200
 and records these conversations from Jesus's life.

219
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,680
 So here comes option number one.

220
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,520
 I'm giving to you straight up.

221
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,480
 Option number one, you can do this with your life.

222
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,760
 You can love money, be moral.

223
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,280
 You know, a pretty good person, not a bad person.

224
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,880
 You can love money, be moral, and miss Jesus.

225
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,040
 That can happen.

226
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,560
 You can love money, be moral, and miss Jesus.

227
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,280
 Let's take a look at this guy who embodies that.

228
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,160
 Mark chapter 10, verse 17.

229
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,600
 It says, "As he, Jesus, was setting out on his journey,

230
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,620
 "a man," we would find out later in the story,

231
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,300
 "a very rich young man,"

232
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,640
 the guy who has the tax bracket you wanna be in, okay?

233
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,920
 "A very rich young man comes out and kneels before Jesus

234
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,060
 "and says," moral language, good teacher,

235
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,000
 "What must I do to inherit eternal life?"

236
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,100
 So this is a moral man.

237
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,020
 And we find out later in the story that he's rich

238
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,820
 and he wants to be a good guy.

239
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,460
 I mean, do you hear this in his question?

240
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,260
 I mean, he walks up to Jesus, title of respect, good teacher.

241
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,760
 "What must I do to inherit eternal life?"

242
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,260
 Comes up to a good teacher, asks a good question.

243
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,620
 And the answer, of course, if you know the scripture

244
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,700
 and you know the character of Christ is not to be good,

245
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,920
 but to trust in a good God.

246
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,600
 That's how you get eternal life.

247
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,440
 But Jesus responds playfully right here.

248
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,820
 He says, "Why do you call me good?

249
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,040
 "No one is good except God."

250
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,760
 It's as if he's saying,

251
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,760
 "If you're gonna call me good, then I must be God.

252
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,020
 "Don't call me good, but don't call me God.

253
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,220
 "Why would you call me good if I'm not God?"

254
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,300
 And he says, "You know the commandments,

255
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,800
 "don't murder, don't commit adultery, don't steal,

256
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
 "be good, be good, be good, be good."

257
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,780
 In other words, Jesus is saying,

258
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,540
 "Look, if I'm not God to you,

259
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,680
 "if I'm not God to you,

260
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,380
 "you're gonna have to be really godly.

261
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,560
 "And if I'm not good for you,

262
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,760
 "if I'm not gonna be your goodness for you,

263
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,700
 "you're gonna need to be really good."

264
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:41,460
 And he says, "Teacher, I've kept all these from my youth."

265
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,360
 This is a rule following person right here.

266
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
 This is not the guy who would have followed you to the party.

267
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,020
 This is the guy who would have avoided

268
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,260
 and looked down on you and been proud of it.

269
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,660
 Some of you know this guy.

270
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,360
 Some of you might be this guy.

271
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,100
 This is the person who could not be swayed morally.

272
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,980
 He is locked in, he is an obedient,

273
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,180
 and he believes he's doing his best,

274
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,540
 but he knows something is missing.

275
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,660
 In Jesus, it says, "Looking at him loved him."

276
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,640
 He loved him.

277
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,660
 Jesus looks at this young, rich guy

278
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,140
 who thinks he's a good person, and he loves him.

279
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,100
 And look what he does next.

280
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,200
 He puts his finger right on the one thing

281
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,540
 that this good guy loves more than Jesus.

282
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,200
 He looks right at him, knows everything about him.

283
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,220
 That's the thing Jesus can do that we can never do.

284
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,100
 It's not like we shake hands and look at someone

285
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,880
 and love them and know everything about their heart.

286
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,420
 We don't do that, we don't have the ability.

287
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,020
 But Jesus, looking at him, loves him,

288
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,020
 and he knows all of his fears, he knows all of his doubts,

289
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,180
 he knows all of his insecurities,

290
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,580
 and he knows all of his ambitions,

291
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,340
 and he knows all of his loves and all of his worships.

292
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,380
 And Jesus looks at him and loves him enough to do

293
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,540
 what he loves all of us enough to do,

294
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,020
 which is to go straight to the top of what he loves

295
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,660
 and say, "Hey, it's gotta be me instead of that now."

296
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,860
 So this is what he says.

297
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
 You lack one thing.

298
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,240
 Go and sell all that you have and give to the poor,

299
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,920
 and you will have treasure in heaven, and come, follow me.

300
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,040
 Give away everything you have.

301
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,540
 Let it go.

302
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,920
 Some of you are like, "I'm at the wrong church.

303
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,260
 "I can't do this, this is too much.

304
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,980
 "I can't let go of everything that I possibly own."

305
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,840
 But Jesus looks at him and he knows

306
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,120
 that this is what the guy loves.

307
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,200
 He's attached to this.

308
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,640
 Jesus is saying, "Cash does not rule everything around me.

309
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,780
 "I rule everything around me, and I love you,

310
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,800
 "and I want you with me if you come with me."

311
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,400
 So let go of the old love.

312
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,260
 Let go of the old driver of your life,

313
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,880
 the thing that has all your affections, which is your money.

314
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
 Let go of that and come with me,

315
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,620
 and you'll be rich, really rich.

316
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,720
 The truth is Jesus does not always do this.

317
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,560
 This is not a rule.

318
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,860
 This is not like, you know, some of you are like,

319
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,700
 "Whew."

320
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,800
 This is not like the thing that everyone has to do

321
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,200
 as far as their money is related.

322
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,640
 But what everyone does have to do

323
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,180
 is they have to let Christ be the number one love

324
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,400
 of their life, not just a good teacher,

325
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,260
 a master, and a treasure.

326
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,720
 And Jesus walks right up to this guy and says,

327
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,440
 "Hey, you got a lot of treasure, but it ain't me,

328
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,100
 "and it needs to be me, and you can come with me,

329
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,520
 "and I wanna replace that false love you've been chasing."

330
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,920
 And here is his reaction, and I want you to see it

331
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,400
 because it's a real option for you.

332
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,260
 It's a real danger for you.

333
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,400
 It says, "Disheartened by this saying,

334
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,080
 "he went away sorrowful."

335
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,600
 Sad, your translation might say he walked away sad

336
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,880
 because he had great possessions.

337
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,240
 You feel how distorted that is?

338
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,840
 Like, can you imagine being face-to-face with Jesus?

339
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,160
 You're face-to-face with God in a bod, you know,

340
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,240
 in a human being, face-to-face.

341
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,880
 And he looks at you, and he loves you,

342
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,640
 and he says, "Hey, you can have me,

343
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,880
 "and you'll be wealthy forever,

344
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,440
 "or you can hang on to the stuff you got right now."

345
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,920
 And this guy is like, he's like sad, he's sorrowful,

346
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,120
 he's confused because he has so much wealth,

347
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
 he can't get out of it.

348
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,960
 You see this guy?

349
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,880
 He's like God on golden handcuffs.

350
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,520
 It's like, "Ah, I'd love to follow you, Jesus,

351
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,840
 "but I got so much stuff, I can't give it up."

352
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,720
 He's stuck by his own wealth.

353
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,600
 He's hooked.

354
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,440
 He's in a chase.

355
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,280
 He's on a treadmill.

356
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,400
 He can't get enough.

357
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,160
 And he gets an invitation.

358
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,240
 Can you imagine the privilege?

359
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,400
 God coming all the way to earth

360
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,840
 to invite you to follow him,

361
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,760
 and instead of saying yes, he gets led away

362
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,520
 by his loves, by his passions, by his worship,

363
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,440
 by what he wanted.

364
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,720
 And you go, "Well, who would do that?"

365
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,360
 And the answer is that you might.

366
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,560
 People do it all the time.

367
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,200
 It just might be a little bit less abrupt, you know?

368
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,600
 It might not be the first thing that comes,

369
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,240
 it might not be like as drastic

370
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,040
 as like a face-to-face conversation

371
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,280
 where Jesus dramatically says,

372
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,880
 "Come with me," and you say, "No, thanks."

373
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,720
 It may not be that.

374
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,440
 It just may be like a more subtle series of trades down.

375
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,560
 Like if you choose a job,

376
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,960
 and this is your thinking when you choose a job,

377
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,160
 if it's like, "What is the paycheck?"

378
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,680
 And you're about to sign on the dotted line,

379
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,880
 but you forgot to hear the job description

380
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,440
 'cause you were excited about the paycheck,

381
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,600
 something's broken there.

382
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,800
 Like something's distorted.

383
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,880
 Your decision-making has been tweaked a little bit

384
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,000
 by the love of money.

385
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,000
 And if you like leave a job because you're like,

386
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,240
 "Oh, $5,000 more.

387
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,060
 "Like I don't need, I don't, you know, say no more.

388
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,900
 "I'm in."

389
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,060
 Like if you are bouncing around the workforce in that way

390
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,800
 is because something has to be broken.

391
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,520
 If that's the only factor being considered,

392
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,720
 if it's the lead factor being considered, something is off.

393
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,280
 And unfortunately, it doesn't just warp our decision-making

394
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,460
 as it relates to our jobs.

395
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,880
 The love of money distorts our decision-making

396
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,560
 as it relates to who to date, who to be with,

397
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,720
 how to choose a man, how to choose a woman.

398
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,120
 Like you know you're under the influence

399
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,520
 of the love of money if like he's a two

400
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,040
 and then he's a law student and he's like baseline seven.

401
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,760
 You know, he just went like from here

402
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,560
 and it's like, boom, he just went really, really high.

403
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,400
 Like that's how you know something is off.

404
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,760
 Guys, if like for you, if you're like,

405
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,440
 "I," you know, if the thing that is like most important

406
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,080
 to you is like you wanna be a power couple

407
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,480
 and you're just like, you're looking for this girl

408
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,080
 who's got this long, amazing resume

409
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,960
 and it's like amazing like work life

410
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,440
 and her accomplishments and all this,

411
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,620
 something, and not her character, you know,

412
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,440
 something might be off there.

413
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,620
 And we're not immune to this in church.

414
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,220
 You know, we'd like to dream that if we're following Jesus,

415
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,980
 that we, if you're in church, if you're in Christ in any way

416
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,120
 and you're walking with him, we'd like to imagine

417
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,500
 that we're kind of immune to that, but we're not.

418
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,780
 Like our mindset can get so twisted and dark.

419
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,480
 In fact, let's take this another level deeper just for fun.

420
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,900
 So if it just so happens that you're in this way of thinking

421
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,340
 and I know everyone's not, so please save the email.

422
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,020
 I promise I know everyone does not think

423
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,780
 what I'm about to do, but some people,

424
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,320
 if you are in the struggle right now

425
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,780
 and you believe that money equals happiness,

426
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,780
 you might be tempted to think of men this way.

427
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,620
 You might be like, okay, look, I'm a Christian,

428
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,420
 so I need this dude to be spiritual.

429
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:08,620
 But I also need to be provided for,

430
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,660
 so I need someone who is rich.

431
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,860
 You might say the word stable because it sounds better,

432
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,140
 okay, but you need someone who is rich, okay?

433
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,540
 So basically, you got your spiritual factor

434
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,800
 and you got your rich factor.

435
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,780
 All right, now here's how you know

436
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,180
 if your thinking is broken.

437
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,060
 You got the guys down here that are neither spiritual

438
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,060
 nor rich and that is the forbidden zone.

439
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,260
 (audience laughing)

440
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,060
 You just, no chance, you just don't even fly there, okay?

441
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,900
 And then up here, you got the guys who are spiritual

442
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,140
 but not rich and we call that the friend zone.

443
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,140
 (audience laughing)

444
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,660
 These are the guys, yeah,

445
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,660
 these are the guys that you ask for advice from.

446
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,540
 These are the guys that you hang out with

447
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,580
 but they're not really an option for you,

448
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,580
 you know what I mean?

449
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,700
 And you call it chemistry and stability

450
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,580
 but it's that, all right?

451
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,180
 But here's my very favorite thing

452
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,420
 about this way of thinking.

453
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,020
 This is my very favorite thing about this graph.

454
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,860
 It seems that there's a white space out here

455
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,100
 that once you are rich enough,

456
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,780
 it no longer matters how spiritual you are.

457
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,060
 You just live out here and we'll work with you, okay?

458
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,580
 It's like, oh, he's heard of Jesus.

459
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,260
 I'll invite him to church, I'll pray for him, you know?

460
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,860
 We'll bring him more into my family

461
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,740
 than me going into his.

462
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,500
 Like we'll find some way to make this work, you know?

463
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,300
 And look, I know it's playful and fun

464
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,000
 and by the way, again, just wanna repeat,

465
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,920
 I am well aware that not everyone in here

466
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,880
 is thinking that way.

467
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,300
 But if you are stuck in thinking

468
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,780
 that money leads to happiness,

469
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,580
 this is just one little example

470
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,280
 of how you're gonna make decisions.

471
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,680
 The golden handcuffs of you chasing wealth

472
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,100
 or even wanting wealth will take you away

473
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,840
 from wisdom in your life.

474
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,680
 It's not by accident that the scripture says,

475
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,960
 "Wisdom is better than jewels

476
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,560
 "and all that you may desire cannot compare with her."

477
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,120
 The desire for wealth will drag you away

478
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,280
 and some of you go, I am not rich.

479
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,720
 This is passing me by because I am not rich.

480
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,320
 Well, here's the truth.

481
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,420
 This is about affections, not possessions.

482
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,320
 See, you can miss Jesus in one of two ways.

483
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,800
 The world can give itself to you

484
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,560
 or the world can withhold itself from you.

485
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,360
 Either way, if you love the world more than Christ,

486
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,180
 you're done.

487
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,800
 Christ wants better for you than this.

488
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,840
 If you want a better option, you should.

489
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,660
 And there is one.

490
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,400
 Here it is.

491
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,720
 Invest money.

492
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,760
 Be joyful.

493
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,600
 And have Jesus.

494
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,600
 Invest money, be joyful, and have Jesus.

495
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,200
 You know, the previous guy, the very next sentence,

496
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,840
 it said, Jesus said, "How hard it will be

497
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,920
 "for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God."

498
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,480
 Because he knows how this messes with our hearts.

499
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
 But there's another option.

500
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,680
 Invest money, be joyful, and have Jesus.

501
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,500
 I want you to see it.

502
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,960
 This is a little metaphor that Jesus uses

503
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,140
 to introduce us to what the right reaction to Christ is,

504
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,480
 what the real reaction, not just financially,

505
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,680
 but in the heart is.

506
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,200
 And he introduces this little two-sentence metaphor

507
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,080
 in Matthew chapter 13.

508
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,580
 And he introduces you to a different perspective,

509
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,040
 a different option, a different possibility for you,

510
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,320
 for your future, for your affections,

511
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,200
 for your heart, for your priorities.

512
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,360
 And it goes like this.

513
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,560
 Jesus says, "The kingdom of heaven."

514
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,280
 So rather than Jesus interacting on this one,

515
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,620
 he's just gonna explain a few things.

516
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,240
 He says, "The kingdom of heaven

517
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,840
 "is like treasure hidden in a field."

518
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,400
 Like treasure, like something economically valuable.

519
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,160
 Hidden in a field, hidden from you all those years

520
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,960
 when you never were able to find it.

521
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,040
 And it says, "One day a man found it."

522
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,880
 He wasn't looking for it.

523
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,480
 "One day a man found it, and he hid it again.

524
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,020
 "And then in his joy, he went and sold all he had,

525
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,360
 "and he bought that field."

526
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,340
 So the kingdom of heaven, so Jesus and all that he offers,

527
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,900
 the chance to be with God and experience

528
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,740
 not just life in heaven,

529
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,200
 but abundant life right here on earth,

530
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,280
 all of that is like something valuable

531
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,640
 that's hidden from you for a long time,

532
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
 but then you have the chance to find it.

533
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,120
 And when you find it, this man, this example,

534
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,680
 doesn't walk away sad.

535
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,980
 It says, "He went into his life,

536
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,500
 "and he made really expensive arrangements

537
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,400
 "to arrange himself around the new priority,

538
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,360
 "and he was happy about it."

539
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,480
 He was glad about it.

540
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,640
 He felt like he won.

541
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,560
 So what's the lesson about money from this guy?

542
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,220
 One, no amount of money is worth as much as Jesus

543
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,360
 and all that he offers.

544
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,280
 No amount of money.

545
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,640
 If you think there's some amount of money,

546
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,080
 if you're like, "There are enough zeros somewhere

547
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,200
 "to satisfy me," there are not.

548
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,880
 There are not enough zeros out there

549
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,800
 at the end of a paycheck, at the end of an inheritance.

550
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,400
 There is no such thing as any amount of money

551
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,640
 that is worth as much as Jesus.

552
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,520
 This guy just wandering along, he goes,

553
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,820
 "Oh, Jesus says it's like this."

554
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,880
 It's like if you're wandering along,

555
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,820
 and you found a treasure, and you go,

556
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,260
 "Well, this is where the treasure is,

557
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,780
 "so I'm gonna go give up everything I have

558
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,320
 "so that I can have this."

559
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,600
 And it's as if he's weighing the scales in his mind.

560
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,800
 And it's the same decision that the guy in Mark 10

561
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,080
 had to make, and instead of weighing the scales

562
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,280
 and kind of going, "Ah, Jesus, or all my stuff,"

563
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,900
 and choosing the stuff sadly, and being like,

564
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,160
 "Well, I guess I'm committed, sorry."

565
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,800
 The guy just rushes off in his joy.

566
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,920
 He's glad, he's happy, and he knows he wins.

567
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,280
 He walks away knowing he won.

568
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,240
 He's dead broke.

569
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,320
 He's got no arms full of money and two arms full of Christ.

570
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,200
 And he's like, "I win."

571
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,900
 In his joy, he went and sold all he had.

572
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,660
 What's the lesson about happiness?

573
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,500
 That having Jesus will actually make you happier

574
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,480
 than chasing money.

575
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,820
 That's different than just saying

576
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,100
 Jesus is worth more than money,

577
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,500
 'cause that's just a fact out there somewhere.

578
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,500
 But Jesus actually affects your emotions

579
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,780
 more positively than money.

580
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,620
 You see this happy guy compared to the sad guy

581
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,860
 who walked away and lost?

582
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,380
 Christ is fulfilling.

583
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,940
 Christ is everything our souls desire.

584
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,980
 And he has the effect on us that we're hoping money will do,

585
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,760
 only to wind up disappointed over and over again.

586
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,520
 And what is the lesson about reacting to Jesus?

587
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,520
 That it is normal to make inconvenient personal changes

588
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
 in reaction to Christ.

589
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,420
 I'm gonna say that again.

590
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,600
 It is normal to make really inconvenient changes

591
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,080
 in reaction to Christ.

592
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,120
 If it's generosity and giving, I'm in.

593
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,820
 If it's a breakup, I'm in.

594
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,740
 If it's changing jobs, I'm in.

595
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,380
 If it's church membership, I'm in.

596
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,520
 This is what devotion sounds like.

597
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,160
 If it's letting my family think I'm crazy, I am in.

598
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,620
 When we meet Christ, we do the thing

599
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,960
 that the rich guy couldn't do.

600
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,260
 Turn loose of whatever you have to turn loose of

601
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,300
 to get your arms around Christ.

602
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,580
 You need to know people really do this.

603
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,920
 Because if you feel like the only one,

604
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,040
 and you feel like you're getting ready

605
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,700
 to make some crazy, radical step of obedience

606
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,960
 that just seems like you're going where no man

607
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,220
 or no woman has ever gone before,

608
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,140
 you just need to know people do this around you

609
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,800
 all the time.

610
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,680
 They are rearranging their lives around Christ all the time.

611
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,100
 I was talking to my friend about this verse.

612
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,460
 And she said, "You know, I made this choice.

613
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,900
 "I lived out that example."

614
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,460
 Matthew 13, 44, I did that.

615
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,400
 She said, "That's me.

616
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,740
 "I was living large, Jesus interrupted my life.

617
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,700
 "I gave up a pretty good husband option.

618
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,280
 "I knew my family would think I'd lost my mind.

619
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,160
 "I knew my friends would think I had gone crazy

620
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,820
 "and joined a cult, but I went and I followed Christ anyway."

621
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,820
 She works on staff here at the cult now.

622
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:46,100
 I said, "Did making that choice make you happy?"

623
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,800
 And she looked at me like, "Obviously.

624
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,080
 "I'm fulfilled, I'm well.

625
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,880
 "I let go of the golden handcuffs.

626
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,360
 "I got them off of me because wealth

627
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,120
 "and everything that was involved in it,

628
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,640
 "what I thought would make me wealthy,

629
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,520
 "all the decisions I thought would bring fulfillment

630
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,660
 "to my life, I knew they were an illusion.

631
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,680
 "And I went after something real.

632
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,080
 "And it changed me, fulfilled me."

633
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,640
 That's a real experience, it's going on all around you.

634
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,640
 And look, if you don't know what to do with your money,

635
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,680
 if you're right there, if you're there

636
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,780
 and you're like, "Give me something practical.

637
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,820
 "Like, give me something to do.

638
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,900
 "What should I do with my money?

639
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,000
 "Like, I wanna know what to do."

640
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,140
 Here's what you should do.

641
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,000
 You should do everything you have to do

642
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,840
 to make sure you're the second person

643
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,880
 that you take option two, whatever it takes.

644
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,240
 That's what you should do.

645
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,200
 I can't choose for you.

646
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,840
 And I know that there's nothing I can do to convince you.

647
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,140
 And I know that if you're committed to chasing money,

648
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,760
 I know that my words are only gonna speed up your certainty,

649
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,900
 that that's gonna satisfy you.

650
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,120
 But if you're willing, if you have the ears to hear

651
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
 and the eyes to see the value of Christ,

652
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,440
 I wanna plead with you, make whatever choice

653
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,000
 you have to make to make sure that you go the way

654
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,280
 of option two, which is to invest money,

655
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,040
 to be joyful and to love Christ.

656
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,080
 Not to miss Christ,

657
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,920
 because you were already prior committed.

658
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,260
 It's so subtle and it's so dangerous.

659
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,880
 Whatever it takes.

660
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,720
 If you need to get away from shopping, get away.

661
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,080
 If you need to drop Amazon Prime,

662
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,860
 sorry, I'm going there, get away.

663
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,460
 If you need someone else to see your paycheck

664
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,560
 so they can give you some guidance

665
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,600
 and give you some accountability, let 'em have it.

666
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,040
 Add 'em to your bank account.

667
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,800
 Oh yeah.

668
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,920
 If you need to give money away

669
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,880
 just to prove to yourself that you're willing,

670
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,720
 God doesn't need your money.

671
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,120
 God's not paycheck to paycheck.

672
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,940
 He doesn't need your money,

673
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,240
 but you might need to give some away

674
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,480
 just to prove to yourself that he doesn't own you,

675
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,520
 because the things you own might own you.

676
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,640
 If you need to get rid of some luxury item you bought,

677
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,460
 do it.

678
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,300
 One time I was in college,

679
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,600
 I saved up some money to buy a pair of shoes.

680
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,680
 I went to the mall.

681
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,360
 I'd been walking with Christ about two years,

682
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,360
 which is not long and not well, for the record.

683
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,840
 But I went in, I picked up these shoes.

684
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,040
 I got 'em.

685
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,320
 I like Air Force Ones, all white.

686
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,160
 That's just me.

687
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,800
 I'm not from North Dallas.

688
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,200
 So I went and picked 'em up.

689
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,240
 I didn't have enough money to do it.

690
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,400
 It wasn't wise.

691
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,240
 And I knew it.

692
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,080
 And I kinda felt uneasy.

693
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,000
 You know those moments where you're like,

694
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,080
 okay, it's not a face-to-face meeting with Jesus

695
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,760
 where he's saying, go right and you go left.

696
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,600
 It's not that.

697
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,560
 It wasn't that clear.

698
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,640
 It wasn't that obvious.

699
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,480
 But I just felt a little uneasy in my spirit.

700
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,920
 And then just in this little insignificant moment

701
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,940
 of making this small purchase

702
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,680
 that I might've had a clear conscience about it

703
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,720
 any other time for whatever reason I was uncomfortable with.

704
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,240
 So I walked away with the shoes.

705
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,760
 And then I was driving home.

706
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,600
 I paid for 'em.

707
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,440
 But I was walking away.

708
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,600
 (congregation laughing)

709
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,440
 And I was driving home.

710
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,600
 And I just knew, I'm like, that was a disobedient.

711
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,040
 Every spending decision is a spiritual decision now.

712
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,160
 I'm walking with Christ now.

713
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,600
 Everything I do, every time I spend, every time I save,

714
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,040
 that's a spiritual choice now.

715
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,240
 And I just made a spiritual choice to enrich myself.

716
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,560
 And I got shoes, man.

717
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
 It's okay.

718
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,720
 So I turned around and I took 'em back.

719
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,320
 And the woman was like, wrong style.

720
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,640
 And I was like, no, I'm a Christian.

721
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,480
 I can't have this.

722
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,300
 No, I'm kidding.

723
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,140
 (congregation laughing)

724
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,980
 I didn't do that.

725
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,800
 I didn't do that.

726
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,280
 And Jesus doesn't want us walking around barefoot.

727
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,440
 But he does want us walking around in obedience to him.

728
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,400
 In the small things, in the big things.

729
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,120
 He wants to own your heart.

730
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,760
 And it is this clear.

731
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,420
 I know some of you, you're just like,

732
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,360
 I'm not an option one or option two guy.

733
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,080
 You know, isn't there like a middle road?

734
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,920
 And I'll just tell you,

735
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,040
 Jesus said no one can serve two masters.

736
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,540
 And if you try, you've already picked your master.

737
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,400
 It's not him.

738
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,520
 I wanna finish by telling you a choice

739
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,080
 that my friend Eric made recently.

740
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,560
 Eric is a friend of mine.

741
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,320
 Eric just came onto the leadership circle

742
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,280
 at the porch in Fort Worth just recently,

743
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
 this month actually.

744
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,480
 And a little backstory on Eric.

745
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,360
 Eric's only been walking with Christ for a few years now.

746
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,760
 He's known about Christ for longer than that.

747
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,020
 But what happened was he continued to move around

748
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,480
 with his job in a way that prevented him

749
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,000
 from having any stability.

750
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,680
 He would move so often

751
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,940
 that he said it was kind of like Vegas.

752
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,100
 Like he could wake up every morning

753
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,040
 and just be a new person to whoever was in front of him.

754
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,280
 'Cause he was in a new place all the time,

755
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,720
 new people all the time.

756
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,120
 Job moved him to Hawaii, Sedona, Flagstaff, Phoenix,

757
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,420
 Los Angeles, Orange County, Seattle, and Dallas.

758
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,120
 And in every place, he woke up, did whatever he wanted,

759
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,240
 partying, sleeping around, drugs, alcohol,

760
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,560
 whatever he wanted, that's where he was living.

761
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,020
 At some point, he picked up Christ along the way.

762
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,320
 And by the time he landed in Fort Worth,

763
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,780
 he decided to do something a little bit different.

764
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,140
 He decided to put down roots in a local church.

765
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,060
 He knew, and I've heard him say it over and over,

766
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:33,120
 that he needed to be receiving the love and care

767
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,220
 and counsel from other people.

768
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,160
 And he wanted to give that kind of love and care

769
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,860
 and counsel to others as well.

770
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,040
 He needed people pouring into him, vice versa.

771
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,600
 He needed to experience community.

772
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,100
 He needed to experience guidance.

773
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,400
 He wanted to lead others and be led.

774
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,280
 And so he dove into the water market, Fort Worth,

775
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,280
 and his life just starts to change, quick.

776
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,540
 Glaring sin, just falling out of his life, left and right.

777
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,460
 Clear conscience, prospering in his relationships,

778
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,920
 building trust like crazy.

779
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,380
 He called me the other day and he said,

780
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:10,060
 "Hey, my job, they just offered me a big promotion,

781
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,660
 "like two steps up."

782
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,620
 Like words like executive thrown around kind of thing.

783
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,260
 "And they offered me a couple hundred grand,

784
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,440
 "but it's not in Fort Worth.

785
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,820
 "What would I do?

786
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,740
 "What should I do?"

787
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,780
 And some of you are like,

788
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,780
 "Dude, I know what you should do.

789
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,780
 "They got churches everywhere.

790
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,840
 "You go and tithe big if you need to.

791
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,560
 "Like if it makes you feel better, you tithe big.

792
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,840
 "But dude, you need to get on that."

793
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,740
 And he said, "I'm just gonna, I'm gonna think about it."

794
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,860
 He called me back a few days later and he said,

795
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,100
 "I walked in and I told my bosses,

796
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,300
 "I said, guys, I wanna work hard for you.

797
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,960
 "I wanna build this company with you.

798
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,780
 "I'm glad you believe in me, even though I'm in my 20s

799
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,420
 "and you want to bring me into your inner circle like that.

800
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,420
 "But there are things in my personal life,

801
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,680
 "my spiritual life, if you wanna know,

802
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,940
 "that are holding me here.

803
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,460
 "I've got some spiritual momentum in my life

804
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,860
 "that I've never had before.

805
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,060
 "And I can't leave that.

806
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,300
 "It's worth more."

807
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,000
 In other words, my priorities aren't for sale.

808
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,900
 They're not for purchase.

809
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,180
 I can't be bribed or bought,

810
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,340
 and I know that's not what they were trying to do.

811
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,160
 But I can't be swayed from the course that I'm on.

812
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,420
 God's doing a good thing in me right now.

813
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,980
 And maybe it might even be right for some other person

814
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,260
 to receive a promotion and receive a massive raise

815
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,900
 and to just go and do that thing in that new place.

816
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,500
 And that might be totally freedom for them,

817
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,260
 but that's bondage for me, and I'm staying right here

818
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,620
 'cause I don't wanna be hasty

819
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,260
 to lead the presence of the King.

820
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:49,820
 And I said, "Well, congrats, Eric, you're rich.

821
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,800
 "Way richer than the people

822
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,500
 "who are still playing this game."

823
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,740
 And if they had added two zeros and offered you again,

824
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,700
 and you said no, you'd still be rich

825
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,460
 because you know what leads to life.

826
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,940
 You know that Christ is worth more than everything else.

827
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,760
 And even though Christ is in every place,

828
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,500
 you know, according to Him, that He's got you in this place

829
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,340
 and you were willing to walk in that obedience

830
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,800
 even though it was expensive.

831
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,100
 This is how we take over the world

832
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,820
 in the name of Christ, friends.

833
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,100
 Did you know that every week,

834
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,420
 over 30,000 people listen to the porch?

835
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,320
 Did you know that?

836
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,820
 And the way, you go, "Well, what do you do?

837
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,020
 "What do you do with 30,000 people?"

838
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,860
 I'll tell you what you do.

839
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,460
 You show up to work with your friends

840
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,080
 in social situations,

841
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,280
 and you show up, instead of striving,

842
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,880
 you show up content.

843
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,120
 You show up satisfied.

844
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,360
 You show up fulfilled in Christ already

845
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,660
 so that you aren't on the rat race treadmill

846
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,840
 of trying to get more like everybody else is.

847
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,120
 And eventually, those heads will turn one at a time

848
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,100
 in the hallway and in holidays with your family,

849
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,360
 one text message at a time,

850
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,260
 and they'll go, "What is it with you?"

851
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,280
 "What do you want?"

852
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,500
 And you can say, "I have what I want.

853
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,320
 "I have Christ.

854
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,840
 "I don't need anything else."

855
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,980
 And I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

856
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,660
 I'm not telling you Jesus wants you to quit your job

857
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,620
 and money's not important.

858
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,100
 I don't wanna downplay the whole thing.

859
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,260
 You need to be a member of society.

860
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,500
 That probably means having a job at this point.

861
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:34,300
 But it's not going to fulfill your soul.

862
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,180
 It might steal it if you're not careful.

863
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,580
 And Christ says, even though it's hard for the wealthy

864
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,220
 to enter the kingdom of heaven,

865
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,580
 he says, "With man, this is impossible,

866
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,740
 "but with God, it's possible."

867
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:51,160
 And I want that miracle for you and for me tonight,

868
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,420
 that we wouldn't miss the kingdom of heaven,

869
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,540
 not just on a permanent basis regarding heaven.

870
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,020
 I'm talking about missing the kingdom of heaven

871
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,840
 that we get to participate in right now

872
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,040
 if we're willing to make obedient, careful,

873
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,960
 alert choices to our real master,

874
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,200
 'cause we can't serve two, that doesn't work.

875
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,880
 And if we do, all across this nation and this world,

876
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,540
 people will start to rise up who say,

877
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,520
 "I don't need more, I have enough.

878
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,900
 "What I need more of is purpose.

879
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,080
 "What I need more of is God.

880
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,240
 "What I need more of is love in my heart

881
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,880
 "so that I can extend it to other people.

882
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,320
 "That's what I need more of."

883
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,080
 And when you have that, you are rich.

884
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,520
 The scripture says, "Godliness with contentment

885
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,720
 "is great gain."

886
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,940
 Godliness with contentment is great gain,

887
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,200
 not godliness with a killer resume.

888
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,920
 Godliness with contentment is great gain.

889
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,360
 If you wanna get ahead, try contentment.

890
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,360
 See what God does for you.

891
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,360
 Let's pray together.

892
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,580
 God, do the miracle in our hearts

893
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,840
 that we're not strong enough to do ourselves.

894
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,320
 Help us fall out of love with our possibilities

895
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,040
 and our freedom and our shoes

896
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,960
 and all the things that just come out of our hearts.

897
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,520
 Will you detach our love and our worth

898
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,600
 and our affections from our possessions,

899
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,560
 the ones we have or the ones we just want?

900
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,440
 Help us want you.

901
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,260
 God, we're here and our prayer is we want a new want.

902
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,880
 We want you.

903
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,300
 We wanna represent you.

904
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:35,160
 Thank you that you love us enough to look right at us

905
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,400
 and say, "Hey, that thing you love more than me,

906
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,240
 "that one's gotta go."

907
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,100
 Whether it's money or a relationship

908
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:47,080
 or habit or an addiction or some piece of bitterness,

909
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,760
 whatever it is that we have,

910
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,440
 you look us right in the face, God,

911
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,540
 and you tell us that has gotta go

912
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,720
 so that I can be number one where it matters.

913
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,160
 God, help us to honor you in every single way.

914
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,760
 In Christ's name, amen.

915
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,760
 Amen.

916
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:12,760
