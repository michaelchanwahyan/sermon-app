1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 I saw this godly woman on the Facebooks the other day. She had like so many scripture verses.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,800
 You poked her yet? I'm thinking about it.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,800
 Have you snapchatted her yet?

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,800
 Totally endorse her communication skills. Yeah?

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,800
 Docked her on Twitter yet?

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,800
 You want me to ask her out for you? Would you?

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,800
 Should I text her to ask her out?

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
 Send a group text.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
 First date, I'm going to take her to my cousin's wedding. What do you think?

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
 Free dinner. Great idea.

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
 Should I ask her dad for permission to take her on a first date?

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
 What is this, 1950?

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
 Awww.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
 (music)

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,800
 (music)

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,800
 (music)

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
 (music)

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
 Looked like a little bit of friendationship was going on there.

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,800
 A little accountability for those guys.

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,800
 What's going on? How are we doing this evening?

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
 (cheers)

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
 Dallas, Fort Worth.

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
 Got folks tuning in in Houston.

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
 If you're listening around the world, we're glad

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
 you're with us as we move through

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
 this series called Save the Date.

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,800
 Save the Date.

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,800
 I thought I'd start here. It's fall.

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
 I love fall. Anybody else love fall?

30
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,800
 (cheers)

31
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,800
 Pumpkin spice lattes. Got to.

32
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
 The weather starts to turn.

33
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
 It's tolerable in Texas.

34
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
 Fall reminds me.

35
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,800
 It begins to lift my spirits

36
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,800
 because I begin to think about

37
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,800
 my favorite time, which is Christmas.

38
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,800
 Love Christmas.

39
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
 I don't know if you guys do Christmas parties,

40
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
 but Watermark staff's

41
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
 Christmas parties are epic.

42
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
 Epic.

43
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
 I don't know what your Christmas parties

44
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,800
 are like. I'm confident they're

45
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
 very different than ours, but ours

46
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
 are epic.

47
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
 I just want to tell you about what this looks like.

48
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
 Todd is the king of fun. He's the senior

49
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,800
 pastor here.

50
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
 We have some competitions

51
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
 and we're all poor pastors.

52
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
 There's losers and winners.

53
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
 The losers lose big.

54
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
 For example, the loser last year

55
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
 had to spend the night in a dunk tank

56
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
 and it was snowing outside.

57
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
 Winners win big.

58
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
 Somebody will donate a prize.

59
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
 For example, all expense paid trip

60
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
 to Costa Rica, four seasons.

61
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
 We're not playing around.

62
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
 There's winners and losers. It's like Hunger Games

63
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
 on staff. People die.

64
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
 No, people don't die.

65
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
 You go big.

66
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
 I've had to do crazy. I've never won,

67
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
 but I've tried really hard.

68
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
 A couple years ago,

69
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
 I had to bob for fruitcake

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
 in eggnog.

71
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
 Yeah.

72
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
 There we go.

73
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
 Scary. I know.

74
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,800
 Two years ago,

75
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
 I was a human

76
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
 gingerbread man.

77
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
 They covered me in maple syrup,

78
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
 covered me in powdered sugar.

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
 That's after

80
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
 I got up and all the stuff had fallen off me.

81
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
 That's our Christmas party.

82
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
 We're not even drunk.

83
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
 Completely sober.

84
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
 Crazy Christmas party.

85
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
 Here's the deal.

86
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
 A year ago,

87
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
 I'm there. I'm with my wife.

88
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
 He says, "Okay.

89
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
 "You get to choose. You can go at this

90
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
 "alone if you're on staff,

91
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
 "or you can bring your spouse in with you

92
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
 "and double your chances of winning,

93
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
 "but also double your chances

94
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
 "of losing. What do you

95
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
 "want to do?" I'm in this real predicament.

96
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
 Okay? Because Monica's

97
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
 there and she's like, "Yeah, you know,

98
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
 "but wait a minute.

99
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
 "I need to know something. What do I need to know?

100
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
 "What are we going to be doing?

101
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
 "Is she good at that?"

102
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
 Whatever it is. Are we going to be doing something

103
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
 she's good at? Are we going to be doing something

104
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
 that ... I need to know what the

105
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
 purpose is before I can choose if I want

106
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
 to go at it alone or not.

107
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
 Likewise, okay? As we talk

108
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
 about marriage and singleness,

109
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
 you have to first determine

110
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
 your purpose, why you're actually

111
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
 here so you can determine, one,

112
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
 do you want to bring someone into that purpose

113
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
 to help you fulfill that purpose?

114
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
 Two, who do you want to bring?

115
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
 Like, who's going to help you fulfill your purpose?

116
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,800
 Who's going to help you do

117
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
 what it is you were put

118
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
 here

119
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
 to do?

120
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
 If I had something that I wanted you to accomplish

121
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
 and I said, "Hey, you can choose to partner up or go at it

122
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
 "alone," you're going to first ask me,

123
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
 "Hey, what do you want me to

124
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
 "accomplish?"

125
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
 God didn't put you here on accident.

126
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
 He didn't, like,

127
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
 mess up. He didn't, like, forget what he was doing.

128
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
 Like, turn his eyes from the factory

129
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
 and all of a sudden you were produced. No, like, He

130
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
 thought about you before the beginning of time.

131
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
 He brought you into this place,

132
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
 time and space, to accomplish

133
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
 something very

134
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
 specifically geared towards you.

135
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
 And in the

136
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
 broadest terms,

137
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
 here's your purpose. I'm going to give it to you from the Scripture.

138
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
 From Genesis to Revelation, it's really

139
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
 repeated.

140
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
 To glorify God in all

141
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
 that you do.

142
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
 Now that can feel, like, big and ambiguous,

143
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
 but in broad terms,

144
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
 from the Bible,

145
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
 repeated over

146
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
 and over, to glorify God

147
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
 in all that you do. Now, if you know

148
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
 that's your purpose, then you can begin to think about,

149
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
 "Hey, do I want to bring

150
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
 someone into the equation to help

151
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
 me fulfill that purpose?"

152
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
 But it also

153
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
 tells you something else. If that's your purpose, to glorify

154
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
 God in all that you do, I want you to lean forward on this.

155
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
 Listen, I just told you why you have breath

156
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
 in your lungs, why your heart beats in your chest.

157
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
 You want to know why you're alive. It's not to

158
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
 get as many pleasures as you can, to build

159
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
 the biggest tower you can, to have as much

160
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
 stuff as you can, to be the most known,

161
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
 to have as many kids as you can.

162
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
 It's to

163
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
 glorify God

164
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
 in all that you do.

165
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
 And the beautiful thing about that

166
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
 purpose is

167
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
 you don't have to wait until you're married

168
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
 to fulfill that purpose. You can do

169
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
 that today,

170
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
 right now, as you

171
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
 leave here, when you wake up tomorrow.

172
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
 You can begin

173
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
 to say, "Okay, I've got so many years left.

174
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
 I'm going to begin to live my purpose

175
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
 to glorify God in all

176
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
 that I do."

177
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
 So tonight, we're talking about,

178
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
 as we move through this series, Save the Date,

179
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
 a dating series here at The Porch,

180
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
 singleness on

181
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
 purpose.

182
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
 Everybody's favorite topic, singleness.

183
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
 Yeah, everybody clap for singleness.

184
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
 We're here, we're talking about singleness. We love singleness.

185
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
 That guy does.

186
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,800
 Thank you, David.

187
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,800
 And so here's the deal. Let me shoot you real straight

188
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
 before we dive in. Disclaimer out of the way.

189
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
 I'm married.

190
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
 What does a married dude know

191
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
 about singleness?

192
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
 What are you going to teach? How are you going to empathize?

193
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
 But you think I forgot about it?

194
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
 You think I forgot what it was like

195
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
 to be single? I was single in Dallas.

196
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
 I was looking for a spouse.

197
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
 So let me

198
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
 ask you a question. Who is the most

199
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
 qualified person to speak? Because every time

200
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
 I go at this, Satan attacks me the same way.

201
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
 I've given this message, or one really similar,

202
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
 every single

203
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
 year because it's so important.

204
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
 And every time I step to the pulpit to give

205
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
 this message, Satan attacks me the same way.

206
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
 He says, "Man, you can't talk to them about that.

207
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
 That's not where you're at. They're not going to trust you.

208
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
 They're not going to believe you." And then every time

209
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
 I begin to dwell on those thoughts,

210
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
 the Lord just comes and says, "Bro,

211
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
 you are so

212
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
 qualified to talk to them

213
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
 about this from my scriptures because you lived it.

214
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
 You did it wrong. You did it right

215
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
 at times. You can tell them from the

216
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
 mistakes you've made."

217
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
 Who is better off to tell you

218
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
 something from the scriptures than someone

219
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
 who's never been there, never seen the

220
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
 next chapter, or someone who's been to the next chapter

221
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
 and says, "Bro, I remember when I was there,

222
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
 and this is what I wish I would have known."

223
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
 So let's dive in. This is what I wish I would have known.

224
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
 Tonight we're talking about singleness on

225
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
 purpose. I'm going to be in

226
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
 1 Corinthians chapter 7, if you want to

227
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
 turn there. 1 Corinthians

228
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
 chapter 7, that's in the New Testament.

229
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
 Paul's letter to the church in Corinth.

230
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
 I'll set

231
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
 this up.

232
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
 It's written about 56 AD.

233
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
 There's some really specific context

234
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
 going on here when Paul writes this letter.

235
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
 The church is under

236
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
 intense persecution,

237
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
 and the apostle Paul, being a prophet,

238
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
 knows that this is going to be

239
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
 intensified. He's right because Nero shows up

240
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
 on the scene, Emperor Nero, about 10 years

241
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
 later, where he takes persecution

242
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
 of Christians to a sport.

243
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
 He has fun with it. He does it for entertainment.

244
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
 He stitches animal skin to

245
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
 them and releases

246
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
 rabid dogs. Dogs tear

247
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
 Christians apart, and people watch for entertainment.

248
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
 It's a whole other level of wickedness.

249
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
 Paul anticipates this.

250
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
 He knows that it's coming, and so he begins

251
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
 to write this letter. "Hey, you need to get ready."

252
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
 I'm going to start

253
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
 in verses 7, 8, and

254
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
 9. What's beautiful is

255
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,800
 verses 7, 8, and 9 are really a preview

256
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
 where he opens up into a commentary

257
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
 there in verse 32. He expounds

258
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
 on these verses in verse

259
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
 32, and that's where we'll spend the rest of our time.

260
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
 Where I'm going to take you is the gift

261
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
 of singleness, the purpose

262
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
 of the gift, and why

263
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
 self-control is important

264
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
 when understanding this gift.

265
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
 So verse 7. "I wish

266
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
 that all of you were as I am," Paul writes.

267
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
 Now, when he says "I am," he's talking about

268
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
 his Facebook status of

269
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
 singleness. He's single.

270
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
 When he says, "Hey, I wish you were like me,"

271
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
 he means, "Hey, I wish you were

272
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
 single like me." But each of you

273
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
 has your own, what's that word?

274
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
 Gift from

275
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
 God. One has this gift.

276
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
 Another has that.

277
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
 Now, to the unmarried and the

278
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
 widows, I say, "It is good for them to

279
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
 stay unmarried as I do.

280
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
 But if they cannot,"

281
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
 what? "control

282
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
 themselves, they should

283
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
 marry, for it is better to marry

284
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
 than to burn with passion." So

285
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
 right off the bat, Paul says, "Hey,

286
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
 there's this thing that I have. It's called singleness,

287
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
 and it's a gift."

288
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
 The Greek word there is

289
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
 charisma.

290
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
 It literally translates, "the gift

291
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
 of God's grace."

292
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
 It's where we get the word charis, where the word

293
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
 charity comes from.

294
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
 And it translates directly,

295
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
 "grace of God."

296
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
 You have a gift,

297
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
 intentionally. And so my first point is, singleness

298
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
 is a gift.

299
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
 Now, you're

300
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
 here, and you're like, "Wait a minute. How do I

301
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
 know if I have the

302
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
 gift of singleness?"

303
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
 And I'm going to help you find out right now, okay?

304
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
 Every person here tonight,

305
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
 and if you're listening in your car, wherever you're at,

306
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
 Houston, Fort Worth, I want

307
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
 you to raise your hand if you

308
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
 are not married. Raise your hand

309
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
 if you're not married, real high. Now, I see some of you,

310
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
 "Oh, wow." Look, there's a lot of you.

311
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
 Wow, okay. Lots of hands went

312
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
 in the air. Okay.

313
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
 If you're married here, you're outnumbered, evidently.

314
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
 Alright, here's the deal.

315
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
 You have the gift of singleness.

316
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
 Every single person who just

317
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
 raised their hands, and those of you who were

318
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
 scared to, have the gift of singleness.

319
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
 Now, what did he just do?

320
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
 Did he just tell me that I'm going to be single? No.

321
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
 No, no, no. Calm down.

322
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
 Okay? Let your pulse

323
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
 go back to normal. Listen.

324
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
 You're single today,

325
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
 so today you have the gift of singleness.

326
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
 And God says it's a gift,

327
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
 so today, this morning, you woke up, you

328
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
 were not married, and so today

329
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
 you have a gift to steward.

330
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
 You have the gift, given

331
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
 to you by God, for God, to do

332
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
 something with, for God.

333
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
 That's what gifts in the scripture are.

334
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
 He's given you a gift, and he's entrusted

335
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
 it to you, for him.

336
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
 That you would steward it for his

337
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
 purposes.

338
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
 That we would know singleness

339
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
 is a gift. Now, I know some of you

340
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
 feel like it's the white elephant gift you got stuck

341
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
 with, that nobody wants to take.

342
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
 Anybody want my gift? It's really good.

343
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
 But listen.

344
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
 There are several wrong views of this gift

345
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
 in culture today. Two

346
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
 main ones. There's an eastern

347
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
 cultural miss

348
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
 on this gift, and there's a western

349
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
 cultural miss on this gift.

350
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
 Let me explain the eastern cultural

351
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
 miss first.

352
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
 This is how the eastern

353
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
 culture has completely

354
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
 botched this gift.

355
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
 They come up and they say, "Hey, you

356
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
 are nothing unless you're married.

357
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
 The greatest goal in life is to get a

358
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
 family. That's your legacy. Without

359
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
 a legacy, you have no memory.

360
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
 So as soon as you effectively

361
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
 and efficiently can, you need

362
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
 to convince someone to marry you

363
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
 and start a family.

364
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
 Because without a family, you're nothing.

365
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
 Now, some of you

366
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
 came from this influence.

367
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
 This influence has actually

368
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
 leaked into some western influences.

369
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
 So maybe you return, you go home

370
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
 for Christmas,

371
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
 and mom or grandma's like,

372
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
 "I mean,

373
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
 doesn't anybody like you?"

374
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
 And you're like, "Oh, thanks."

375
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
 "Do you not want

376
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
 to be married?"

377
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
 You know, you're like, "Hey mom, it's not really up to me."

378
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
 "Hey, I mean,

379
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
 aren't there any nice guys

380
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
 or aren't there any nice young ladies

381
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
 where you live?" And you're like, "Dude, get off my

382
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
 back." And so then you don't go

383
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
 home anymore. I get it.

384
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
 The western

385
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
 culture error,

386
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
 or the western culture

387
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
 miss on this gift

388
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
 is that this life

389
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
 is to create

390
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
 an empire.

391
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
 It's all about you

392
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
 and the pleasures that you can absorb

393
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
 and the securities that you can surround yourself

394
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
 with. You are building a tower

395
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
 to you of which a

396
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
 spouse or a family is

397
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
 simply a brick in that tower

398
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
 should you choose one. If you don't

399
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
 need one, all the more power to

400
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
 you, okay? But if you want one,

401
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
 get one, and it's an accessory.

402
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
 Just make sure

403
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
 that you can afford one.

404
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
 Make sure that you're completely

405
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
 independent first, that you have

406
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
 everything that you need, and

407
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
 that you have built this tower of money,

408
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
 a resume, possessions, successes,

409
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
 ambitions first.

410
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
 And as long as you find the

411
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
 right one, you can add them to the list.

412
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,800
 And that's also a miss.

413
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
 It's untrue. It's unbiblical.

414
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
 It's a terrible way of

415
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
 thinking and living. And so the result

416
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
 of the Eastern error is that

417
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
 a spouse is necessary for survival,

418
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
 so you actually get married to survive

419
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
 financially in that world.

420
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
 And the

421
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
 result of the Western culture

422
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
 error is that you don't get

423
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
 married until you can afford to.

424
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
 That marriage is this very

425
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
 expensive accessory

426
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
 that it's a wedding, you bought into this

427
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
 lie, this culture that you live in, and

428
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
 so until you can afford it, you don't even think

429
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
 about it. And they're both wrong.

430
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
 Because God says singleness

431
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
 is a gift. He says marriage

432
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
 is good, but He says singleness is

433
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
 good too. And He has purposes

434
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
 in it. He has

435
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
 something you want to accomplish.

436
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
 And so what are good reasons

437
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
 to be married? We covered this last week, just

438
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
 as a review, because God says it's good,

439
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
 because it is a strategy

440
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
 to make disciples by raising children

441
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
 in a family unit,

442
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
 and because it is a picture of

443
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
 God's commitment to us. A

444
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
 metaphor of Jesus and the church.

445
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
 Our bridegroom married to His

446
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
 bride, the church. God invented

447
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
 marriage, and He invented it to

448
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
 teach us something about

449
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
 Him. And it serves

450
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
 a purpose.

451
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
 And so what's

452
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
 missing in that list of reasons?

453
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
 To be

454
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
 complete.

455
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
 That's not

456
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
 a reason to be married.

457
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
 There's no Jerry Maguire theology here.

458
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
 You don't need marriage

459
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
 to be complete.

460
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
 Let me ask you a question.

461
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
 Was Jesus complete?

462
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
 I mean, was Jesus

463
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
 not the most complete human being

464
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
 ever to walk the face of the planet?

465
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
 And was He married?

466
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
 No, no, God,

467
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
 when He wanted to be fully effective as a human,

468
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
 remained single.

469
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
 Jesus was single.

470
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
 Now, I know what you're thinking. You're like, "Yeah, but He was also God."

471
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
 Did the Apostle Paul live

472
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
 a complete life?

473
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
 Yeah, he did.

474
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
 So did missionaries like Eric Little.

475
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
 So did amazing

476
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
 authors like C.S. Lewis.

477
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
 People that you've been influenced by.

478
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,800
 So did Mother Teresa.

479
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,800
 Amy Carmichael, who's a missionary

480
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
 in India, opened an orphanage, founded

481
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
 a mission, wrote books that have influenced

482
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
 tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Christians.

483
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
 Corrie Ten Boom, who helped

484
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
 Jews escape the Holocaust, saved lives.

485
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
 Katie Davis, still alive today,

486
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
 our peers, right? She saved the lives

487
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
 of 13 girls in Uganda.

488
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
 Are their lives complete?

489
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
 Are their lives more complete than yours?

490
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
 Are their lives more complete than mine?

491
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
 Why? What are they doing?

492
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
 What did they do?

493
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,800
 They used their gift

494
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
 of singleness. They saw it

495
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
 as a gift, not begrudgingly.

496
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
 They used it.

497
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
 They deployed it. In fact, Dietrich Bonhoeffer,

498
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
 when he's going to

499
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
 come against the Nazi regime, led

500
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
 by Hitler, and he has

501
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
 to recruit people into a

502
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
 seminary to teach them God's Word,

503
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
 you know he strategically went

504
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
 after single people because

505
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
 he knew that married people

506
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
 and those who had families would be

507
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
 distracted from this mission and tied

508
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
 down and unable to accomplish

509
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
 this grand call that God

510
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
 was calling him to.

511
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,800
 He lived a very complete

512
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
 life. Those who served under him lived

513
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
 a very complete life. And so,

514
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
 regardless of how you feel,

515
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
 you must let God, who created

516
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
 all things, define

517
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
 whether singleness is good or not.

518
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
 Marriage serves a purpose.

519
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
 Singleness serves a purpose.

520
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
 Said otherwise, you serve a purpose

521
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
 in marriage. You serve a purpose

522
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
 in singleness.

523
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
 That's the gift you have today.

524
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
 That's the gift you receive today

525
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
 if you raised your hand earlier.

526
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
 I remember when I was growing up,

527
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
 when Christmas was coming,

528
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
 there was a gift that I really, really

529
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
 wanted. It was a remote-controlled car.

530
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
 Like one of those, have you ever seen

531
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
 with the kind of gun remotes and the

532
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
 steering wheel here? You ever seen this?

533
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
 And so it was like this car,

534
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
 a specific car that I'd seen. It was really fast.

535
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
 My buddy had one. All I wanted was

536
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
 this remote-controlled car. And so,

537
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
 Christmas rolls around. I'd get up early,

538
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
 as was the routine, wake everyone up

539
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
 to my sibling's demise, and go

540
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
 under the Christmas tree, and we began

541
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
 to rip into presents. And the first one

542
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
 I opened was a hammer. And the second

543
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
 one I opened was this set of

544
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
 screwdrivers. And the next present

545
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
 I opened was this socket wrench set.

546
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
 But lo and behold, okay, I got closer

547
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
 and closer to this big square box,

548
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
 and I was like, "I know. It's the remote-controlled

549
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
 car." And I opened it up,

550
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
 and it was a toolbox.

551
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
 Okay? For all the tools I had received.

552
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
 And I remember being so discouraged

553
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
 because I wanted some other gift.

554
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
 And you know what happened?

555
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
 I eventually got it. I got the car.

556
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
 The white remote-controlled car,

557
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
 I remember, it was fast, it was fun.

558
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
 I played with it every single day

559
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
 for about a month.

560
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
 And then the batteries died at one point.

561
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
 I put it on the shelf, never recharged it.

562
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
 Sold it in a garage sale several years later.

563
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
 And I was like, "I'm going to die."

564
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
 And I was like, "I'm going to die."

565
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
 I put it on the shelf, never recharged it.

566
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
 Sold it in a garage sale several years later

567
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
 for about 50 cents.

568
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
 You know, I still have those tools.

569
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
 Some of the tools I received when I was young

570
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
 at my parents' house, I still have them.

571
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
 I still use them.

572
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
 I didn't appreciate that they were useful,

573
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
 that they were good for something.

574
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
 And you know, with the tools, they're work.

575
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
 Like, to use them, you have to put in work.

576
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
 And I think that an error that people think is,

577
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
 "Well, if singleness is work, I must be called to marriage."

578
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
 And then the error that married people make is,

579
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
 "Well, if marriage is work, then it must be wrong.

580
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
 I'll go back to singleness."

581
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
 Singleness and marriage,

582
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,800
 they're both a lot of work.

583
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
 They're both a lot of work.

584
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
 They're both gifts.

585
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
 And you have one of them today,

586
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
 to use today.

587
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
 And one day you will regret

588
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
 not using the gift you have today.

589
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
 Because you're sitting there

590
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
 like a kid who didn't receive

591
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
 what he wanted for Christmas,

592
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
 and you're looking into the future

593
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
 and say, "What's this for?

594
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
 What's this good for? I want that."

595
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
 And then married people say,

596
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
 "What's this good for? I want that."

597
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
 And half of them,

598
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,800
 or more than half of them, go back to that.

599
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,800
 Do you see that?

600
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
 So why does Paul say,

601
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
 "Now to the unmarried and the widows I say,

602
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,800
 it is good for them to stay unmarried as I do."

603
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
 And this is what he enters in verse 32-35.

604
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
 Let's go.

605
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
 Commentary on this passage.

606
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
 "I would like you to be free from concern," Paul writes.

607
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
 "An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs,

608
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
 how he can please the Lord.

609
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
 But a married man is concerned

610
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
 about the affairs of this world,

611
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
 how he can please his wife.

612
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
 And his interests are divided.

613
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
 An unmarried woman, or virgin,

614
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
 because if she's unmarried

615
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
 it's assumed that she's a virgin in this text,

616
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
 is concerned about the Lord's affairs.

617
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
 Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord

618
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
 in both body and spirit.

619
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
 But a married woman is concerned

620
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
 about the affairs of this world,

621
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
 how she can please her husband.

622
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
 I am saying this for your own good,

623
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
 not to restrict you, porch,

624
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
 but that you may live in right way

625
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
 in undivided devotion to the Lord."

626
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
 Who doesn't want to be married to someone

627
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
 that lives to please them?

628
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
 Who doesn't want to be married

629
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
 to someone that lives to please them?

630
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
 Who doesn't want to be married

631
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
 to someone that lives to please them?

632
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
 Like my hunch is, if you're here

633
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
 and you desire to be married,

634
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
 you want to be married to someone

635
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
 that lives to please you.

636
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
 And Paul says that's a distraction

637
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
 to their primary calling, living to please God.

638
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
 Them living to please you

639
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
 is a distraction to their primary purpose

640
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
 of living to please God.

641
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
 You're a distraction to their ministry.

642
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
 Don't find someone who's a distraction

643
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
 to your ministry.

644
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
 Find someone who's an asset

645
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
 to your ministry.

646
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
 Find someone who helps your ministry.

647
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
 Find someone who dives in with you

648
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
 and ministers with you

649
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
 in your ministry.

650
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
 And so my second point this evening

651
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
 is singleness serves a purpose.

652
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
 Singleness serves a purpose.

653
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
 It allows for undivided devotion

654
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
 to the Lord.

655
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
 That's what Paul writes.

656
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
 It allows for undivided devotion

657
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
 to the Lord.

658
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
 And so let me just, you know,

659
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
 this is where the whole married thing

660
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
 comes in handy.

661
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
 This morning

662
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
 I woke up

663
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
 to complete and total chaos.

664
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
 And here's what that looks like.

665
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
 My son Weston, sick with

666
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
 104 fever at 5.30 this morning.

667
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
 He's crying out.

668
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
 We get up. She gets up.

669
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
 I support her as she gets up.

670
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
 And then my little girls come in.

671
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
 They're jumping on our bed.

672
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
 Then we get up. We begin to make breakfast.

673
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
 Monica has to run to the school

674
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
 to take a project that she helped

675
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
 the teacher with. I have to stay there with Weston

676
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
 as I wait to go to work.

677
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
 We're making breakfast for them.

678
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
 We're doing that whole deal. And the chaos really starts

679
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
 yesterday. I left this place about 6pm.

680
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
 And I leave here

681
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
 and I race through traffic to get to

682
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
 Finley's soccer practice. I go to pick her up.

683
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
 But first it's a dad scrimmage.

684
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
 So we get out of the car, scrimmage the girl.

685
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
 Then get back in the car, go pick up some Chinese food

686
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
 on the way home. And then we just

687
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
 begin this race of, "Is homework done?"

688
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
 "You don't have homework yet. You're three."

689
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
 "You need to do the bath time for you."

690
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
 "Can you all take a bath? Go. Other bath. Other shower."

691
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
 "Now you all get in bed. Pajamas. Lotion. You ready?"

692
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
 "Do you have a fever? Oh no. Let's give him some Tylenol."

693
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
 "Now you all get in here. Bedtime. Let's say,

694
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
 'Dear God, please protect them and help them sleep.'"

695
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
 "Now prayers with you."

696
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
 "I've got to write a porch message for tomorrow."

697
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
 "Hey babe, I've got to write a porch message for tomorrow."

698
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
 "I've got to write a porch message for tomorrow."

699
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
 "Hey babe, I've got to write a porch message for tomorrow."

700
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
 "Hey babe, I've got to write a porch message for tomorrow."

701
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
 "Hey babe, I've got to write a porch message for tomorrow."

702
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
 "I have a feeling this is going to make it in there."

703
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
 And so if you feel stressed,

704
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
 And so if you feel stressed,

705
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
 If you feel stressed,

706
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
 If you feel stressed,

707
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
 If you feel stressed,

708
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
 just wait until you have this little thing that the IRS calls

709
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,800
 "dependence."

710
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
 Because they're stress multipliers.

711
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
 Because they're stress multipliers.

712
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
 That's what they do.

713
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
 And so let me just keep hitting this home

714
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
 because he's talking about not being distracted

715
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
 and living in full devotion to the Lord.

716
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
 Do you know that since becoming a Christian,

717
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
 Do you know that I've been to Africa,

718
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
 I've been to Rwanda, Kigali,

719
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
 I've been to Kenya, Nairobi,

720
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
 I've been to the Masai Mara,

721
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
 literally the African jungle.

722
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800
 Do you know that I've been to Brazil

723
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
 three different times.

724
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
 Go there in a Manaus, get on a boat,

725
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
 travel for days down the Amazon River,

726
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
 get off in the Amazon jungle and begin to share people.

727
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
 I've done that three times, separated by months

728
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
 and even years at a time.

729
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
 Do you know I've been to Haiti four times.

730
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
 Four different times. The island nation of Haiti.

731
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
 Fly on a plane, get off the plane, get out

732
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
 and begin to do ministry there.

733
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
 Go up into the mountains to tribal people,

734
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
 share the gospel. Come down the mountains

735
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
 to the urban people and share the gospel.

736
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
 Go into Mission of Hope,

737
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
 to the villages, to the orphanage,

738
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
 to the hospitals, to the clinic, to the churches,

739
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
 to the schools, sharing the gospel.

740
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
 Do you know how many times,

741
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
 how many international trips

742
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
 I've been on since my son Weston was born?

743
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
 (silence)

744
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
 (silence)

745
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
 If you're listening, that's a zero.

746
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
 (laughter)

747
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
 (laughter)

748
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
 He's three years old.

749
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
 None.

750
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
 None.

751
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
 Why?

752
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
 Because I've got this primary ministry

753
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
 that is now

754
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
 a distraction

755
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,800
 to those secondary

756
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
 and third ministries.

757
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
 I'm distracted.

758
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
 My attention, my devotion

759
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
 to the Lord is now divided.

760
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
 I have responsibilities.

761
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
 I have dependents that require

762
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
 my time, right?

763
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
 Everything begins to change.

764
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
 Let me just say this real quick.

765
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
 The porch is going to Haiti. If you're here and a member here,

766
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
 there's not a single reason in the world that you shouldn't go.

767
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
 When we say

768
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
 unashamed, you need to be

769
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
 the first person in line. If you're here

770
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
 and you live in Dallas and you're single,

771
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
 you need to be the first person in line.

772
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
 That's using your singleness.

773
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
 There's not a

774
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
 single reason in the world

775
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
 you wouldn't go to Haiti with us

776
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
 and experience what God is doing there.

777
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
 You'll regret not going, I'll just tell you

778
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
 right now.

779
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
 I could go

780
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
 on and on. Sunday,

781
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
 I've got to go to the Apple store.

782
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
 Alright? I mean,

783
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
 torture, right?

784
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
 You go there and you wait for hours.

785
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
 I had an appointment and you wait for hours.

786
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
 My phone's broken, so I'm like, "I've got to go to the Apple store."

787
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
 Willow Bend. I'm just driving around.

788
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
 I'm like, "I need a buddy. You've got to go to the Apple store with a buddy.

789
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
 Who wants to sit there alone for hours?"

790
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
 I'm like, "You know what? I'll call Marshall." I can't call Marshall.

791
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
 He's got three kids. His wife's not going to let him

792
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
 go on a Sunday. Not because

793
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
 she's mean, but just because he's got

794
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,800
 responsibility. I'll call Simon. I can't call Simon.

795
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
 I mean, it would be irresponsible for me

796
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,800
 to pull him away from his family. I'll call Mike.

797
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,800
 I can't call Mike. Sunday

798
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
 afternoon, they're about to go to lunch,

799
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
 they're about to start dinner. I can't call Mike.

800
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
 He's about to sit down with his family. I'll call John.

801
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
 He's got a baby at the house.

802
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
 He's helping his wife with the baby. I can't call John.

803
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
 Who do I call? I'm going to go

804
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
 on Twitter and tweet to all my single friends.

805
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
 Anybody want to go to the Apple store?

806
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
 You can't just up and leave.

807
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
 Do you know that in the past two weeks, and I'm not

808
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
 bragging, okay? I'm just laying this out for you.

809
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
 In the past two weeks, I've been invited to go fishing.

810
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
 I've been invited to go hunting. I've been invited

811
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
 to go to the beach, and I've been invited to go to Israel.

812
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
 In the past

813
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
 two weeks, and I'm like, nope.

814
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
 Nope. Nope. You can't just up and

815
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
 leave. I can't just up and go hunting.

816
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
 I went fishing, honestly. But I can't just

817
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
 do that, right?

818
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
 I can't just, "Hey, Monica,

819
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
 I won't be home for dinner tonight."

820
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
 "No, you're going to stay at home." "Oh, I know. It's a lot going on

821
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
 that whole rat race." "You got that, though.

822
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
 I'm going to go hunting.

823
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
 I'm going to go to Israel for 10 days."

824
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
 That's cool, right?

825
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
 No, I'm sure. Yeah, it's cool, right?

826
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,800
 You can't just do that.

827
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
 I can't do that.

828
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
 You can do that.

829
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
 Only for the season in your life.

830
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,800
 You can go to Haiti.

831
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
 You can come up with

832
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
 a thousand reasons not to go and cross them all out.

833
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
 Say, "You know what? I can go. Why wouldn't I?

834
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
 I'm in.

835
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
 Why can't I go? I can totally go.

836
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
 JP can't go. I can go.

837
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
 I might be there."

838
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,800
 Here's the

839
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
 punchline.

840
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
 Your ministry should be more impactful than mine.

841
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,800
 I'm distracted.

842
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
 I've got

843
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
 these three little kids I disciple on a daily basis.

844
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,800
 You can have 30.

845
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
 Your ministry,

846
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
 according to this text,

847
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
 should be so much more

848
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
 impactful than mine, right?

849
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
 And this is

850
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
 why I do what I do.

851
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
 Right?

852
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
 I mean,

853
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
 again, I mean this humbly, but

854
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
 to show you my heart. I've been offered

855
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
 jobs, senior pastor

856
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
 jobs.

857
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
 I don't want to do that.

858
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
 I want to hang out with the

859
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
 most influential, impactful demographic

860
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
 of the church. Give me

861
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
 the single people.

862
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,800
 That's who God's going to use to change

863
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
 the world. That's why I'm here.

864
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
 That's why I invested. That's why I'm not going to get

865
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
 to tuck in those three kids tonight.

866
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
 Because I want to be with you.

867
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
 Telling you

868
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
 not to waste this season

869
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
 of your life. It's a gift,

870
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
 man. And it serves

871
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,800
 a purpose, man.

872
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
 You've got to go all in. You've got to

873
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800
 wake up and begin to protect yourself

874
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
 from the enemy's distractions

875
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
 to you. Because now's the time

876
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,800
 to wake up and make a difference

877
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
 and do all the things that God,

878
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
 his Holy Spirit has set in your heart

879
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
 that you dream about.

880
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
 That you would not be distracted,

881
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
 but focused.

882
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,800
 Say, "God, I'm ready. I'm here.

883
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
 Take me."

884
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,800
 If I could go back and talk

885
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
 to my 21-year-old self,

886
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
 I would beg him to get after it.

887
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
 Do you know what to teach 1 Corinthians 7?

888
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
 I've got men who are employed

889
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
 by the church who sit over commentaries

890
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,800
 and come with illustrations and help me.

891
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
 I sit over the commentaries myself. I have to

892
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,800
 learn this text, the cultural context, so that

893
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
 I can sit up here and teach it to you.

894
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
 You know when Todd, senior pastor of Watermark,

895
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
 when he gets up here, he's just pulling from his 20s.

896
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
 He's just giving you

897
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
 stuff he learned when he was 16,

898
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
 18, 21 years old.

899
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
 If I could go back and talk

900
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,800
 to my 21-year-old self, I would

901
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
 beg myself, "Hey, get out of the bar.

902
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
 Get out of the club. Stop sleeping

903
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
 around. Deal with your porn issue.

904
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
 It's time to learn the Bible.

905
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
 Write it on your heart.

906
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
 Know it.

907
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
 Read it every day

908
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,800
 and do what it says."

909
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
 Now's the time

910
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
 to have full

911
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
 devotion, undivided devotion

912
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
 to the Lord.

913
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
 Are you concerned about the affairs

914
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
 of the world or the Lord?

915
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
 Your purpose

916
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
 as a single person is to be fully

917
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,800
 devoted to the affairs of the Lord,

918
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,800
 Paul writes.

919
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
 He says, "I'd like you to be free from

920
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
 concern. With marriage comes real

921
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,800
 concern." Did Jesus

922
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
 not make this same exact point?

923
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
 Because some of you are like, "Well, there's a weird

924
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,800
 cultural context. It happened in 1 Corinthians

925
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,800
 7. I've been to seminary."

926
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,800
 Listen, did Jesus not say the same thing in Matthew

927
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
 19? They come to him and they say, "Hey,

928
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
 Rabbi, can we get divorced

929
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
 for any reason?" He says, "No.

930
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
 You can't get a divorce. Have you not read

931
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
 that what God has brought together let man not separate?

932
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
 Moses let you get a divorce because your hearts

933
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,800
 were hardened, but it wasn't so

934
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
 when God invented marriage."

935
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,800
 The disciples said to him, "If this is

936
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,800
 the situation between a husband and a wife,

937
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
 if we can't leave her, then

938
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
 it's better not to marry."

939
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
 And Jesus said,

940
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
 "Not everyone can accept this word."

941
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
 We know that. "Not everyone can

942
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
 accept this word, but only those

943
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
 to whom it has been given.

944
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
 For there are eunuchs."

945
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
 We've got to explain that word.

946
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
 Eunuch is where we get the word unicorn.

947
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
 No, we don't. I'm just messing with you.

948
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
 Eunuch.

949
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
 Listen, listen, listen. I'm sorry.

950
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
 It's a distraction.

951
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
 Sometimes that just happens.

952
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,800
 A eunuch

953
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,800
 is a single person devoted to celibacy.

954
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
 More specifically,

955
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,800
 it's a person who

956
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
 has no reproductive organs.

957
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
 It's a male who's been castrated.

958
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
 Now, I wrestle

959
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
 with, "Why is that in the Scripture so much?"

960
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
 I believe the Scripture

961
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
 tells us because it's a

962
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
 single person devoted to celibacy.

963
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
 Either something

964
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
 has happened to them, they were born a particular way,

965
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
 and Jesus is going to give us a third category here.

966
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
 This is the category I think very relevant to us.

967
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
 You ready?

968
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
 Some eunuchs were born that way.

969
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
 Single person

970
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
 devoted to celibacy.

971
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
 And there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs

972
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
 by others. Second category.

973
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,800
 And then this is us. Ready?

974
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,800
 And there are those who choose

975
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
 to live like eunuchs

976
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
 for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

977
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
 The one who can accept this should accept it.

978
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
 Did you hear what Jesus just said?

979
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
 There are those who are devoted

980
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
 to celibacy and singleness

981
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
 for the kingdom of heaven.

982
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
 Okay, that's cool, Jesus. And then he says something

983
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
 crazy.

984
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,800
 Those who should accept, or who

985
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
 can't accept this

986
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
 should. Do you see what he just did?

987
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
 It's like there's

988
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
 married people. That's cool.

989
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
 And then there's those who are

990
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
 devoted to singleness and celibacy

991
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,800
 for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

992
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
 And that's amazing.

993
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
 And you can be that person today.

994
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
 Now I'm not talking about for your whole life.

995
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
 I don't know what tomorrow holds for you.

996
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
 I've got no idea.

997
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
 But today you've got the gift.

998
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
 So use the gift today.

999
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
 Today you have that gift.

1000
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
 So steward that gift today.

1001
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
 If your purpose is to glorify God

1002
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
 and all that you do, start now

1003
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,800
 because it only gets harder.

1004
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
 Now what's the biggest distraction

1005
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
 to living this purpose in singleness?

1006
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
 What's the biggest distraction to living this purpose in singleness?

1007
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
 What's the biggest distraction to living this purpose in singleness?

1008
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
 What's the biggest distraction to living this purpose in singleness?

1009
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
 Full devotion, Lord.

1010
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
 I'm going to say it if you don't.

1011
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
 It's sex.

1012
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
 You want sex.

1013
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
 I want to have sex.

1014
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
 And I've been told that as a single person

1015
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
 I'm not supposed to have sex.

1016
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
 Girls, you might call it companionship.

1017
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
 Like I've heard that

1018
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
 a lot of people have a lot of companionship.

1019
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
 And I've heard that a lot of people have a lot of companionship.

1020
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
 Like I've heard that

1021
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
 girls give sex to feel loved.

1022
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
 Guys give love to get sex.

1023
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
 But it's sex.

1024
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
 We want the accompaniment.

1025
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
 Like you're telling me

1026
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
 that I might miss out on this thing

1027
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
 that's so important to me

1028
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
 called sex.

1029
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,800
 Samson didn't miss out on that, right?

1030
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
 Got after it.

1031
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
 Verse 9 says,

1032
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
 "But if they cannot control themselves,

1033
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
 they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion."

1034
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,800
 And then the commentary in verse 36.

1035
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
 You ready?

1036
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
 "If anyone is worried that he might not be

1037
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
 acting honorable toward the virgin

1038
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
 he is engaged to,

1039
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
 and if his passions are too strong..."

1040
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
 This is not a guilt trip at all, okay?

1041
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
 This is not a guilt trip at all, okay?

1042
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
 If you know my story, this is not a guilt trip.

1043
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
 But if you're engaged to someone,

1044
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
 it's assumed they're a virgin here in this text.

1045
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
 And if his passions

1046
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
 are too strong and he feels

1047
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
 he ought to marry,

1048
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
 he should do as he wants.

1049
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
 He is not sinning. They should get married.

1050
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
 "But the man who has settled

1051
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
 the matter in his own mind,

1052
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
 who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will,

1053
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
 and who has made up his mind

1054
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
 not to marry the virgin,

1055
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
 this man also does the right thing.

1056
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
 So then, he who marries the virgin

1057
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
 does right, but he who does not marry her

1058
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
 does better."

1059
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
 What?

1060
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
 My third

1061
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
 final point this evening is singleness and self-control.

1062
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,800
 Singleness

1063
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
 and self-control. See, in the world of singleness,

1064
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
 your only option for sex is celibacy.

1065
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
 That means no sex.

1066
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
 Okay?

1067
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
 On Facebook,

1068
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
 recently, someone stole a picture

1069
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
 of my family from Facebook

1070
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
 and posted this meme.

1071
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
 And it says, "This guy,"

1072
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
 meaning me, "posts happy

1073
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
 family photos on Facebook

1074
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
 and tells gay people to live single

1075
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
 and celibate lives."

1076
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
 This was a person that I was ministering to

1077
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
 and I thought we were having a great conversation

1078
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
 and we agreed to disagree on some things

1079
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
 and I was really hurt by this

1080
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
 just because it felt

1081
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
 like, you know,

1082
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
 I was trying to help him and

1083
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
 and then I got to thinking,

1084
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
 I was like, "Well, it's true."

1085
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
 I do tell all single people

1086
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
 to live celibate lives.

1087
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
 Jesus tells all

1088
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,800
 single people to live celibate lives.

1089
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
 The Apostle Paul tells

1090
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,800
 all people to live celibate lives.

1091
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
 God, through the Holy Spirit,

1092
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
 authors the book, the Scriptures, which tells all people

1093
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
 to live, all single people, rather,

1094
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
 to live celibate lives.

1095
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
 Let me say that in a different way.

1096
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
 Tells all people to steward well

1097
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
 the gifts they've been given for the kingdom.

1098
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
 That's what it should say.

1099
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
 This man posts

1100
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,800
 happy pictures of his family

1101
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
 on Facebook and tells all people

1102
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,800
 to steward appropriately the gifts

1103
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
 that God has entrusted to them for his glory

1104
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
 and his good purpose.

1105
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
 And I do that unashamedly

1106
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
 because I know that God,

1107
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
 that every good and perfect gift comes from

1108
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
 the Father of heavenly lights.

1109
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
 That God knows you.

1110
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
 That he's intimately involved

1111
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
 in your lives. There's nothing you've done

1112
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
 he can't forgive you for. Nothing.

1113
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
 He delights in forgiving you

1114
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
 for the wicked that you've done

1115
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
 as you turn to him and say, "I'm going to follow you now."

1116
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
 He delights in that.

1117
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
 Those parties in heaven, it says,

1118
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
 when that happens.

1119
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,800
 There's nothing you've done that he can't forgive you for.

1120
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
 And he's calling you

1121
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
 to follow him right now

1122
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
 in self-control,

1123
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
 guided by his Holy

1124
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
 Spirit.

1125
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
 And he's like, "You want to sell out for sex

1126
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
 and miss your purpose?"

1127
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
 No way.

1128
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
 Because you thought

1129
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
 sex was ultimate? No way.

1130
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
 Use your singleness

1131
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
 strategically to be devoted

1132
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,800
 to the Lord.

1133
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
 You've got these two options in life.

1134
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
 You can use your singleness strategically

1135
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
 to be devoted to the Lord, or you can make disciples

1136
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
 in marriage.

1137
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
 And he says, "Hey, if you burn with passion, then get

1138
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
 married." I love that he says that.

1139
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,800
 He gives you your options, very limited.

1140
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
 He says, "Hey, you want to have sex? Get married."

1141
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
 He doesn't say, "Hey, you want to have sex? Masturbate."

1142
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
 It's a good way to relieve the stress.

1143
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,800
 He said,

1144
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
 "Hey, you want to have sex? Hey, when you're dating,

1145
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,800
 go a little bit too far. Push the line

1146
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
 a little bit."

1147
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,800
 No, he gives you two. He gives you one option.

1148
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
 If you burn with passion, get married.

1149
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
 It's your only

1150
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
 option now. Don't get married before you deal

1151
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,800
 with some of the reasons that you

1152
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
 burn with passion.

1153
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
 If you've helped that fire

1154
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
 do pornography and

1155
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
 sexual sin.

1156
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
 Guys,

1157
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
 let me tell you something. I think

1158
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,800
 you'll agree with me if you

1159
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
 give me a chance. Sex outside of marriage has done

1160
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
 more damage to marriage than just about anything

1161
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
 I can think of.

1162
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800
 Sex outside of marriage has done

1163
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
 more damage to marriage than anything I can think

1164
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
 of. And here's why. Because

1165
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
 you've got to think about this. God invented sex.

1166
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
 He made the parts. He made them

1167
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
 function the way they do. It's his brilliant invention.

1168
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,800
 It's like him and Jesus and the Holy Spirit

1169
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,800
 were sitting around like, "Hey, we want to bring babies.

1170
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
 How can we do that?" Holy Spirit's like,

1171
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,800
 "I don't know, man. They could

1172
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,800
 say this word and babies could come."

1173
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
 He's like, "No, man. Let's make it more intimate than that."

1174
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
 "Oh, I know. We'll take

1175
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
 that and make that and make those

1176
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
 work together like that and babies will be born."

1177
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,800
 "Oh, that's genius, Jesus.

1178
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
 That's what we'll do."

1179
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
 And he invented sex. I'm telling you

1180
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,800
 it was something like that. I don't even know. It's not in the

1181
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
 Bible, but it was something like that.

1182
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
 He invented sex.

1183
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
 And it serves a purpose.

1184
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,800
 Procreation. And it brings a

1185
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
 husband and a wife together in a way where

1186
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
 they have to act selfless toward one another

1187
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,800
 in order to do that because sex when

1188
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
 you're fighting is not fun regardless and

1189
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,800
 contrary to what you've heard, two people

1190
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,800
 that hate each other don't have great sex.

1191
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,800
 You have to love

1192
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,800
 each other in order to come together in that very

1193
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,800
 intimate act.

1194
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
 So what happens

1195
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
 if you've been having sex whenever you feel

1196
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
 like it by yourself?

1197
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
 You get in marriage and you are

1198
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
 selfish as all get out and you think

1199
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
 it's just going to be there whenever you want, but that's

1200
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
 not how it works. The female body

1201
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,800
 has to be loved and cherished

1202
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
 and cared for to open up in that way.

1203
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,800
 And so

1204
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,800
 you get there and you're like, "I want sex." She's like, "I don't care what you

1205
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,800
 want, okay? I hate you." And you're like, "Oh,

1206
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
 man, that's unfortunate."

1207
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
 And so right?

1208
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,800
 And you're like, "Well, that's crazy, JP. That doesn't happen."

1209
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
 Oh, does it not happen most of the time?

1210
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,800
 Like, do you think those divorces

1211
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,800
 they just happen? Like one day everything's amazing,

1212
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
 wild, crazy, monkey sex from the chandeliers

1213
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
 and they're like, "I don't think I love you anymore."

1214
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,800
 No, no, no, man. Those divorces represent

1215
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
 long seasons of celibacy

1216
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,800
 in marriage, which is much more difficult

1217
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
 than celibacy in singleness.

1218
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,800
 You tracking with me?

1219
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
 Divorces represent

1220
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
 long seasons

1221
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,800
 of celibacy in marriage.

1222
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
 That's celibacy with someone of the

1223
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
 opposite sex naked lying next to you.

1224
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
 Celibacy. That's really

1225
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
 difficult celibacy.

1226
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,800
 You tracking with me?

1227
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
 You guys following? Don't think too hard about it, okay?

1228
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,800
 Just nod

1229
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,800
 your head in agreement.

1230
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
 And so do you see God's

1231
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
 genius design? He's like, "Hey, you're gonna have to

1232
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
 act unselfish toward one another

1233
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
 or unselfish rather toward

1234
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,800
 one another so that you can come together in

1235
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,800
 that act. And if you take that act out of what

1236
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,800
 it was meant to be, you learn selfishness,

1237
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
 a pattern of selfishness,

1238
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
 which ruins your marriage long before your

1239
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
 marriage ever comes into

1240
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
 existence.

1241
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,800
 Why do you think marriage decline

1242
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
 is directly related to people having

1243
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,800
 sex outside of marriage?

1244
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800
 Sex outside of marriage goes

1245
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,800
 up, marriage goes down.

1246
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
 Sex outside of marriage

1247
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
 stays down, marriage goes up.

1248
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,800
 See the video we saw last week.

1249
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,800
 Tell me God's

1250
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
 not brilliant.

1251
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,800
 Tell me he's not so much smarter

1252
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,800
 than we are.

1253
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,800
 And then there's this topic, and I'll

1254
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
 just hit this briefly, of sanctification.

1255
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,800
 See,

1256
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
 in marriage you're sanctified through learning

1257
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,800
 to get along.

1258
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
 In singleness you're sanctified through

1259
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
 celibacy, learning

1260
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
 to control your desires,

1261
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,800
 yielding them to God. You're sanctified.

1262
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,800
 You are made more like God

1263
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,800
 by learning to control

1264
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,800
 your desires.

1265
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,800
 So to honor God as a single

1266
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,800
 person, you need to know three things about sex.

1267
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,800
 One, it's a distraction

1268
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,800
 to his purpose for your life.

1269
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,800
 Two, it is absolutely

1270
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,800
 not ultimate.

1271
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,800
 No one in the history of history

1272
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
 has ever died because they haven't

1273
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,800
 had sex. What happened

1274
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,800
 to Mary? She was a

1275
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,800
 virgin, man. Just went.

1276
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
 Never happened.

1277
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
 And three,

1278
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
 it's not an option for you.

1279
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,800
 Let's take that

1280
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,800
 option, remove it from the table.

1281
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
 Maybe an option later for you

1282
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,800
 in marriage, not an option for you in singleness.

1283
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,800
 It's

1284
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,800
 not an option.

1285
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,800
 And so if you have sinned in that way, you can be

1286
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,800
 forgiven, but make

1287
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,800
 sure you remove the temptations.

1288
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,800
 And use

1289
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,800
 this gift of singleness to get well.

1290
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
 Okay, I'm gonna give you five things

1291
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,800
 and we're gonna end. Five ways

1292
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
 to use this gift of singleness.

1293
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,800
 You ready? Number one,

1294
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,800
 if you've sinned,

1295
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,800
 I'm sorry, heal rather

1296
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,800
 from hurts and habitual

1297
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,800
 sin. And

1298
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
 I'm just gonna add one. Ready? Just flat

1299
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,800
 out weirdness, okay?

1300
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,800
 You guys try to be like, if you don't know how to

1301
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,800
 pick up your clothes or like do the dishes

1302
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,800
 or you have these weird idiosyncrasies

1303
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,800
 that people don't want to tell you about,

1304
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
 would you take some time to heal from that?

1305
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
 Okay, like listen to them

1306
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,800
 say, "Hey, help me. I

1307
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
 need help in growing up." And they'll help you

1308
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
 so that you don't pull someone down

1309
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
 in the act of marriage. So take time

1310
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,800
 to heal from hurts and habitual sin.

1311
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,800
 Number two, learn how to love.

1312
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
 And so if every relationship

1313
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,800
 in your rearview mirror has crashed and

1314
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,800
 burned, you don't know how to

1315
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800
 love. Learn how. Get a

1316
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800
 roommate. The dysfunctions of two

1317
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,800
 roommates trying to get a same-sex roommate

1318
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,800
 and the dysfunction of those people trying to live

1319
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,800
 together because they'll tell you, "Hey, pick up your clothes.

1320
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
 Do the dishes. Help out

1321
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
 every now and then." Or they'll just ignore you for months

1322
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,800
 at a time, right? But whatever that is, that

1323
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,800
 working through that dysfunction will

1324
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
 help you. I am firmly in the

1325
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,800
 camp that no single people should live alone,

1326
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,800
 okay? I'm firmly in that camp.

1327
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,800
 Alright? I remember Monica and I, right

1328
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,800
 after we got married, we went

1329
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,800
 through this deal called Homebuilders Group

1330
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,800
 and they began to instruct us on conflict

1331
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,800
 resolution and I was like, "Man,

1332
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,800
 I wish I would have known that

1333
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,800
 with my roommate. We wouldn't have fought so

1334
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,800
 much. I wish I would have learned how to communicate

1335
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,800
 in that way. I wish I would have learned those skills

1336
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,800
 and tactics, right, and strategies

1337
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
 before I got married as a single

1338
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,800
 person, right?"

1339
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,800
 Number three, serve.

1340
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,800
 All in, man.

1341
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
 What are your dreams to change the world?

1342
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
 What is preventing you?

1343
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,800
 Gosh, what is preventing

1344
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,800
 you from changing the world and

1345
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,800
 fulfilling those dreams right now?

1346
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,800
 Do something crazy

1347
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,800
 or just be faithful.

1348
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,800
 Four, be a disciple.

1349
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,800
 Find someone

1350
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,800
 older than you or smarter than you

1351
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,800
 or both that knows

1352
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,800
 one more Bible verse than you do or whatever that

1353
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,800
 is and say, "Hey, will you teach me the

1354
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,800
 Scripture?"

1355
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,800
 And fifth,

1356
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,800
 disciple someone. Find someone

1357
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,800
 who you know at least one more

1358
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,800
 Bible verse than they do and teach them

1359
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,800
 the Scripture. Spend

1360
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,800
 time with them, explaining

1361
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,800
 God's Word to them. And so in

1362
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,800
 summary, singleness is a gift.

1363
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,800
 Be strategically single.

1364
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,800
 Live out your purpose, single or

1365
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,800
 married.

1366
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,800
 And sex is not available

1367
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,800
 to single people.

1368
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,800
 Just as I

1369
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,800
 wrap up, I just want to say this, that

1370
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,800
 I know there's girls

1371
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,800
 that have been

1372
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,800
 here that

1373
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,800
 have dreamed of getting married since

1374
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,800
 you were four years old.

1375
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,800
 [silence]

1376
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
 And I get it.

1377
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,800
 I got two

1378
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,800
 girls at home, six and eight.

1379
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,800
 Finley came home yesterday

1380
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,800
 singing that, you know,

1381
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,800
 Finley and whoever

1382
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,800
 sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

1383
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,800
 She actually goes, "Daddy, does K-I-S-S-I-N-G

1384
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,800
 spell kissing?" I knew

1385
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,800
 where she was going with this.

1386
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,800
 And I just get, I feel the

1387
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,800
 pressures on the world, of the world

1388
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,800
 from her at six years old to get

1389
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,800
 married.

1390
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,800
 Like, this is crazy.

1391
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,800
 And so I know that

1392
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,800
 some of you have felt

1393
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,800
 these pressures since you were four years old

1394
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,800
 to get married.

1395
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,800
 And there's this, it has to

1396
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,800
 be running through your mind right about now, like this

1397
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,800
 whole message, maybe you tuned me out one time, you're like, "Hey, JP,

1398
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,800
 you know, it's not exactly up to me.

1399
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,800
 Like, I'd love to move from this life

1400
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,800
 stage to that life stage, and I'm

1401
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,800
 thinking about that, and I'm looking at this gift, it doesn't feel like

1402
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,800
 a gift, I want that gift, and I don't

1403
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,800
 even know if that's ever going to happen to me."

1404
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,800
 Guys,

1405
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,800
 here's what I know, man. You're here

1406
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,800
 this long, and

1407
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,800
 then you go somewhere, and I want to show you something

1408
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,800
 that God says

1409
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,800
 to people who were single

1410
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,800
 and celibate and used their

1411
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,800
 celibacy for the kingdom of God. You know, He says

1412
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,800
 this in Isaiah 56,

1413
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,800
 verse 5, He says this,

1414
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,800
 "For this is what the Lord says to

1415
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,800
 those who have lived celibate lives,

1416
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,800
 who keep my sabbaths,

1417
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,800
 who choose what pleases me,

1418
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,800
 and hold fast to my covenant.

1419
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,800
 Listen to them.

1420
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,800
 I will give

1421
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,800
 within my temple and its walls a

1422
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,800
 memorial and a name better than

1423
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,800
 sons and daughters.

1424
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,800
 I will give them an everlasting name

1425
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,800
 that will endure forever."

1426
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,800
 You want, you're like, "I was born to be a mom,

1427
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,800
 JP." Do you think God

1428
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,800
 doesn't know you were born to be a mom?

1429
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,800
 He says, "Hey,

1430
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,800
 I will give you one day much sooner than you

1431
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,800
 think something more valuable

1432
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,800
 than sons and daughters.

1433
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,800
 Forever and

1434
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,800
 ever and ever." There's no family

1435
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,800
 up there, you know that? The only family

1436
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,800
 in heaven is the family of Christ.

1437
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,800
 This is who my brothers

1438
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,800
 and sisters are. Remember, they come to Jesus,

1439
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,800
 "Hey, your mom's here." What are you talking about? This is who my mom

1440
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,800
 is. There's no family up there.

1441
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,800
 There's no, there's no husbands

1442
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,800
 and wives up there. I'm going to get

1443
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,800
 there and Monica is going to be a friend

1444
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,800
 to me. I mean, it's crazy

1445
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,800
 to think about

1446
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,800
 because in the kingdom, he reprioritizes

1447
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,800
 everything.

1448
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,800
 And he says it's about us

1449
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,800
 and the family of God and him.

1450
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:20,800
 And I just,

1451
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,800
 I want to tell you this. Friday,

1452
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,800
 Friday was our

1453
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,800
 wedding anniversary. We've been married 11

1454
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,800
 years. 11 years, man.

1455
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,800
 [Applause]

1456
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,800
 It's crazy. Over

1457
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,800
 a decade, these

1458
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,800
 three kids, it's like

1459
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,800
 sometimes I feel like I'm playing house, you know?

1460
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,800
 Like I have no idea what I'm doing, but

1461
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,800
 just figuring it out as I go along.

1462
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,800
 And whenever you cross a

1463
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,800
 boundary like that, a mile marker, like an anniversary,

1464
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,800
 you sit back and you reflect.

1465
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,800
 We look back on the 11 years.

1466
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,800
 It's been a crazy 11 years. And honestly,

1467
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,800
 it's gone up and to the right, man.

1468
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,800
 It's cliche,

1469
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,800
 but I wrote in her card, I said, "I know it's

1470
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,800
 cliche, but this has been

1471
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,800
 the best year ever."

1472
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,800
 She's changed so much. I've

1473
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,800
 changed so much. She's become

1474
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,800
 the godliest woman I know. I'm not just saying

1475
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,800
 that up here. I mean, it's true. I really, I

1476
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,800
 thank God for that when I'm all by myself.

1477
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,800
 I mean, her

1478
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,800
 body's changed. She has this scar

1479
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,800
 right here, big scar

1480
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,800
 where three children were

1481
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,800
 cut out of her. I love that scar.

1482
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,800
 And everything it

1483
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,800
 represents.

1484
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,800
 I love her so much. But as we

1485
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,800
 reflect on the past 11 years,

1486
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
 we looked at our biggest regrets.

1487
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,800
 We said the same

1488
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,800
 thing. There weren't in the past 11 years.

1489
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,800
 There were the 11 years

1490
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,800
 before the 11 years.

1491
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,800
 We were both so

1492
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,800
 grieved

1493
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,800
 by how

1494
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,800
 we wasted

1495
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,800
 those seasons of our life, by how

1496
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,800
 we stewarded something

1497
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,800
 that God said was a gift.

1498
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,800
 And we used that gift for our own selfish

1499
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,800
 pleasures and desires. We created

1500
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800
 habits in our lives that did not go

1501
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,800
 away easily.

1502
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,800
 I mean, they have taken

1503
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,800
 11 years

1504
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,800
 of faithful

1505
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,800
 sanctification in the work of

1506
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,800
 the Holy Spirit

1507
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,800
 to learn to live with each other in a

1508
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,800
 selfless way.

1509
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,800
 And so this is

1510
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,800
 why I've given my life

1511
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,800
 to this ministry. I don't

1512
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,800
 want to do anything else. There's

1513
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,800
 nowhere I'd rather be than

1514
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,800
 right here in front of you

1515
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,800
 begging you to

1516
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,800
 stop playing games and

1517
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,800
 wasting your singleness.

1518
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,800
 You don't lose

1519
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,800
 if you remain single.

1520
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,800
 You lose if you waste

1521
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
 your singleness.

1522
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,800
 There's no

1523
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,800
 better time

1524
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,800
 than to create a

1525
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,800
 place that Jesus would

1526
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,800
 return to with every

1527
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,800
 gift and every talent

1528
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,800
 and every dollar

1529
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,800
 and every possession

1530
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,800
 and every relationship

1531
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,800
 and every occupation

1532
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,800
 and every training and every

1533
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,800
 skill set and anything

1534
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
 that you've received along the way.

1535
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,800
 There's no

1536
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,800
 better time to take all of

1537
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
 that and say, "Here you go, God.

1538
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,800
 Let's go.

1539
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,800
 I'm not waiting for something

1540
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,800
 else.

1541
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,800
 What do you want to do with me? Where do you want

1542
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,800
 to send me? How do you want

1543
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,800
 to use me? Who do you want me

1544
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,800
 to share with? Who do you want me to pour

1545
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,800
 into? Who can pour into me, God,

1546
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,800
 to make me a more effective warrior for you?

1547
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
 God, if

1548
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,800
 you bring someone into my life

1549
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,800
 to live out my purpose with, praise

1550
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,800
 be to you. And if you don't, I will

1551
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,800
 live in full devotion

1552
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
 to you until I die.

1553
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,800
 Until I

1554
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,800
 leave this place. If I'm

1555
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,800
 80 years old,

1556
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,800
 90 years old,

1557
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,800
 100 years old,

1558
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,800
 I will serve you with

1559
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,800
 every minute you give me

1560
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,800
 in full devotion

1561
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,800
 to live out my purpose, to

1562
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,800
 glorify you

1563
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,800
 in everything I do. What else are you going to do, guys?

1564
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,800
 What else

1565
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
 are you going to do? Get rich?

1566
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,800
 Explore

1567
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,800
 some pleasures that you know you

1568
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,800
 feel guilty of five seconds afterwards?

1569
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,800
 You're going to get drunk again?

1570
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,800
 You're going to keep

1571
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,800
 partying? Snort

1572
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,800
 another line? Slam

1573
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,800
 another shot? What are you

1574
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,800
 going to do, man?

1575
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,800
 You're going to keep playing games? You're going to keep

1576
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,800
 wasting your life?

1577
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,800
 Are you

1578
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,800
 going to go in?

1579
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,800
 Go all in?

1580
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,800
 Let me pray that you would.

1581
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,800
 Father,

1582
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,800
 I don't know how

1583
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,800
 much time we have,

1584
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,800
 but

1585
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,800
 would you take whatever it is?

1586
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,800
 And, Father,

1587
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,800
 would you use it for your good purpose?

1588
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,800
 Father, would you

1589
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,800
 use it for your glory?

1590
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,800
 God, would you help us to see that

1591
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,800
 whatever you've entrusted to us for whatever

1592
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,800
 season you've entrusted it to us

1593
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,800
 for, would you help us to see it as a

1594
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,800
 gift, Lord? Would you

1595
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,800
 give us hearts of gratitude

1596
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,800
 that we would deploy those gifts as

1597
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,800
 others, the great cloud of witnesses who

1598
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,800
 have gone before us and deployed those gifts

1599
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,800
 so well?

1600
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,800
 God, would you help us to use whatever

1601
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,800
 talents you've entrusted to us? If it's

1602
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,800
 two talents, if it's five talents,

1603
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,800
 if it's ten talents, God, help us to see

1604
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,800
 it and multiply it, double it.

1605
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,800
 God, would you change the world through my

1606
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,800
 single friends in this room? Every hand

1607
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,800
 that went in the air, God, I pray

1608
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,800
 that they would lose the mindset that

1609
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,800
 they're in a waiting room, a holding tank,

1610
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,800
 waiting for something, some other

1611
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,800
 season to be effective, that they would see

1612
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,800
 today, God, please help them see today

1613
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,800
 as their most effective

1614
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,800
 days of ministry, that

1615
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,800
 they would give their lives back to you and

1616
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,800
 say, "Here I am, Lord, use me."

1617
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,800
 Father, you are our shepherd

1618
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,800
 and we are your sheep.

1619
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,800
 Would you guide

1620
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,800
 and lead us according

1621
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,800
 to your good purpose?

1622
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,800
 If you're here and you feel like you're

1623
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,800
 single and forgotten,

1624
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,800
 or maybe you're here and you

1625
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,800
 look back and you see all this sexual sin,

1626
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,800
 this like stuff, you know that you're like

1627
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,800
 the woman at the well who's like, "Hey, that's not

1628
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,800
 my husband." He's like, "You're right, you've had five husbands

1629
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,800
 and this guy's not your husband."

1630
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,800
 Or you're here and you've lost someone,

1631
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,800
 maybe you went through a breakup recently

1632
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,800
 and you feel so alone in that,

1633
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,800
 you're going to love Jesus.

1634
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,800
 Jesus always moved towards

1635
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,800
 those people,

1636
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,800
 the widow,

1637
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,800
 the survivor

1638
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,800
 of someone in the grave,

1639
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,800
 the woman at the well,

1640
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,800
 the

1641
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,800
 prostitute.

1642
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,800
 Jesus always moved towards

1643
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,800
 those people. He always offered

1644
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,800
 those people fulfillment,

1645
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,800
 completeness,

1646
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,800
 purpose.

1647
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,800
 Purpose.

1648
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,800
 And so, He doesn't

1649
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,800
 want your scraps.

1650
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,800
 He doesn't want

1651
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,800
 this thing that you've

1652
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,800
 added to your life, this accessory

1653
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,800
 called Christianity.

1654
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,800
 He doesn't want you to call yourself a Christian

1655
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,800
 by a cross on your neck or

1656
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,800
 entitle. He wants your everything.

1657
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,800
 Full devotion.

1658
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,800
 He wants you talking to Him when you're

1659
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,800
 all by yourself and no one can see you

1660
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,800
 talking to Him, so you're not at all tempted

1661
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,800
 to be prideful in what you might pray, even out loud.

1662
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,800
 But when you're in your

1663
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,800
 closet,

1664
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,800
 when you're by yourself in your room,

1665
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,800
 you would go to Him and you'd beg Him and you'd

1666
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,800
 plead with Him. And you'd pursue

1667
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,800
 a relationship with Him

1668
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,800
 harder and faster and

1669
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,800
 more than you've ever pursued a

1670
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,800
 relationship with anyone.

1671
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,800
 Because everything wrong

1672
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,800
 you've done, He paid for.

1673
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,800
 On the cross, He literally

1674
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,800
 wiped your slate

1675
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,800
 clean, so that when God looks at you,

1676
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,800
 He's no longer counting your sins

1677
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,800
 against you, because He understands

1678
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,800
 they've been paid for through Christ. His death

1679
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,800
 and resurrection is forgiveness for your

1680
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,800
 sins.

1681
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,800
 If we can help clarify that, or simply

1682
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,800
 pray with you that you would believe that

1683
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,800
 there's going to be red shirts all over this

1684
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,800
 place,

1685
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,800
 that would love the opportunity to do that.

1686
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,800
 If you don't know what full devotion

1687
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,800
 looks like for you,

1688
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,800
 red shirts all over this place.

1689
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,800
 If you want to go to Haiti with us, you go to that Welcome Center,

1690
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,800
 you write down, "I want to go to Haiti."

1691
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,800
 Your email, and we'll follow up with you.

1692
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,800
 We're going to take about 100, 150

1693
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,800
 people of you, 150 of you

1694
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,800
 with us to Haiti.

1695
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,800
 We're just going to do more in Dallas of what we do

1696
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,800
 there. We're going to

1697
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,800
 change the freaking world for the cause of

1698
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,800
 Christ. That's what we're going to do. Go in peace, to love,

1699
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,800
 and serve the Lord.
