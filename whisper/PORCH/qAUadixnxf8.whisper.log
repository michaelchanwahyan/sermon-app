[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:30.960]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.640]   What's up, Ports?
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.400]   How we doing?
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.480]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.080]   Greetings, Dallas.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.120]   Greetings, Fort Worth and Houston.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.800]   And if you're listening around the world,
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.040]   we're so glad you are.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.000]   So excited about what God is doing
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.280]   through the lives of 20 and 30-somethings.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.400]   I'm so excited that so many of you
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.160]   are not wasting your life chasing the American dream,
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.560]   and that we can gather like this around God's word,
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.160]   and that the Spirit of God can speak to us and change us
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.640]   and make us new and give us hope for eternity.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.240]   And so what a blessing it is to worship with you guys.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.160]   My name is JP.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.320]   If you're a guest with us, it's great to meet you like this.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.000]   And I hope to meet you afterwards face to face.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.080]   And I'll tell you a little bit about myself.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.320]   I have, since I was little, since I was in junior high,
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.160]   I've always loved wrestling.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.280]   I've loved to wrestle.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.360]   You get with your boys, like, hey, let's wrestle.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.960]   And so I've always loved that.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.960]   And I am a like below average wrestler at best.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.560]   But when I came to work here at Watermark,
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.400]   we hired this guy named Brandon Slay.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.640]   And so Brandon and I met and we became friends.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.680]   And then we worked together here
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.480]   because Brandon had a heart for vocational ministry.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.960]   He wanted to give his life to advancing the gospel
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.080]   and building the kingdom.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.320]   Well, the unique thing about Brandon Slay
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.840]   is he's an Olympic gold medal wrestler, okay?
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.120]   And so that, here's what that means in case you don't know.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.600]   It means he's the best in the world, the best in the world.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.080]   Like there is no one better than this man.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.560]   He is one in a billion good or even more than that.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.520]   And so he goes to launch with us,
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.720]   just to give you a for instance,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.200]   he goes to launch retreat with us.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.600]   And this guy's like, hey, Brandon,
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.720]   you know, I wrestled in high school, let's wrestle.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.840]   Brandon's like, you sure?
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.840]   You know, he's like, yeah.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.320]   And so they're just playing around.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.640]   But Brandon's an athlete, an Olympic athlete at that.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.960]   And so he has no 50%, he has no half speed,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.360]   he has no kind of go slow mode.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.840]   And so he just like first, like he jumps down, pops up.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.160]   And on the pop up, hits my friend,
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.880]   breaks his ribs, punctures his lung.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.440]   We got to take him to the hospital.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.280]   His lungs 90% deflated.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.400]   Like I didn't know, I was like, no, go back and play.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.240]   You'll be fine.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.080]   Lo and behold.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.440]   And so for some reason, I don't know, pray for me.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.080]   I was like, hey, Brandon, I'd like to wrestle sometime.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.240]   I know, stupid.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.040]   And so we go and we get on the mat,
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.560]   'cause I'm thinking like I'm a big guy, you know.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.760]   And I've got a picture of him if you want to see.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.600]   There he is.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   And he's a big guy, but not, but he, you know,
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.160]   five, eight, something.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.800]   And so we get on the mat and like, I just,
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   I remember like, man, there is something
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.400]   super human about you.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.520]   Like he did whatever he wanted to do.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.120]   And I almost died.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.360]   And so I'm sitting there like after 15 minutes,
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.440]   so true story, first contact, he's just like,
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.000]   kind of does one of those and like pops a vertebrae
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.560]   out of place.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.560]   I'm not kidding.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.320]   I think about him every single morning of my life
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.480]   'cause my neck still hurts.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.440]   I'm not kidding.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.320]   And so then we wrestle 'cause I didn't know better.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.760]   And 15 minutes, I just want to throw up all over the place.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.920]   I've done nothing.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.800]   And he's still smiling like, man, show me some submission
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.640]   moves or something.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.320]   I'm like, dude, come on, what are we doing?
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.080]   And here's what I remember thinking.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.920]   Like this guy is so powerful.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.160]   It was just like this, this wake up call,
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.560]   like the chasm between he and I is infinity big,
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.360]   like so enormously big.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.720]   He is so much more powerful than me.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.000]   And the same kind of wake up that I had in that moment
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.680]   is what the disciples are gonna have in this story,
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.400]   this evening.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.880]   It's this realization that this rabbi that we've chosen,
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.880]   oh, wow, he is so much more powerful
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.760]   than we ever could have imagined.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.240]   The same way that I felt about Brandon,
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.080]   they felt infinitely more so being with Jesus.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.440]   And so this evening, we're gonna look at the power
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.040]   of Jesus over evil.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.860]   We're gonna be in Mark chapter five,
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.800]   if you wanna turn there.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.200]   Because I think this is so important for us this evening,
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.880]   because for so many of you, if you grew up in the church,
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.560]   when you think about Jesus,
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.320]   you might picture him like this, right?
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.320]   It's effeminate Jesus.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.360]   Sometimes he's throwing up the deuce.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.040]   Sometimes he's holding a pet lamb, you know,
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.300]   got wavy flowing permed hair.
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.240]   And if you're anything like I was,
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.760]   like you're sitting there overwhelmed by sin,
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.520]   like materialism owning your life,
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.240]   pornography for me, sexual addiction for me,
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.840]   like me kind of going through this world,
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.640]   searching for significance,
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.480]   reaching for anything that I can,
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.280]   all of these hurts, habits, and hangups.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.440]   And I'm like, that guy ain't gonna help me.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.960]   Like the thing that I'm enslaved to,
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.440]   it's so powerful and it's owning me.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.320]   And I need something stronger than it.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.920]   And I don't know if it's him.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.360]   And I want you to know,
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.800]   he is infinitely stronger
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.360]   than whatever is gripping you right now.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.840]   Infinitely stronger.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.280]   So if you're gonna fight something stronger than you,
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.800]   you need to find something stronger than it.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.200]   And he's just the man for the job.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.440]   I wanna show you that in the text this evening.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.800]   We're in a new series we started last week called AD.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.840]   AD is just an abbreviation,
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.080]   it's medieval Latin for Anno Domeni,
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.240]   which means literally translated the year of the Lord.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.200]   The Lord in that is Jesus Christ.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.040]   It was the year of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.640]   and they shortened it to AD.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.800]   Here's what that means.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   Today, 2016, we are counting 2016 years from BC.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.920]   That means before Christ.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.800]   God shows up on the scene in the form of Jesus Christ
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.480]   and he reset the calendar.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.160]   And it's the calendar that we use
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.760]   and that most of the known world uses.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.300]   It's the calendar that your Microsoft Outlook uses,
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.880]   your iPhone uses.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.160]   They count from Jesus's birthday.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.720]   That's significant.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.280]   And so we're in this series looking at the year of the Lord,
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.120]   interactions with Jesus.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.760]   And tonight we're gonna look at the objective of the enemy,
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.960]   Jesus's power over the enemy,
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.040]   and the objective of Jesus.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.720]   And if I haven't sucked you in yet,
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.820]   we're gonna talk about some demonology this evening.
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.600]   And so maybe that will intrigue you.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.800]   And so to set this up, in Mark chapter four,
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.200]   Jesus, he's in Capernaum, he's hanging with his boys
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.460]   and he's like, let's get on a boat.
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.560]   Now this is significant
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.480]   because boats didn't have motors at this time.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.280]   And so to go across the Sea of Galilee was quite the feat.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.840]   Jesus is sleeping in the boat and a storm comes.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.520]   And this storm is significant
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.200]   because these fishermen by trade,
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.160]   people who had lived on that Sea of Galilee,
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.260]   they're terrified.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.100]   They're so afraid.
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.920]   They wake Jesus up.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.560]   They're like, do you not care about us?
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.960]   Look at what's happening.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.520]   And it's this comical scene.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.840]   Jesus gets up and is like, hush.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:00.840]   I mean, wind stop, seas calm.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.620]   And it says about the disciples that they were terrified,
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.820]   not of the storm now,
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.800]   but of this man that they had led in their boat.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.940]   They're like, oh wow, he's more than a rabbi.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.580]   The wind and waves obey him.
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.920]   And Jesus is on a mission.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.240]   He's going across the Sea of Galilee.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.120]   I was just there months ago on the same sea
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.340]   where Jesus is in a very similar boat
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.660]   to the one that he's on.
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.440]   And he gets off the shore
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.940]   and we'll pick up in Mark chapter five, verse one.
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.180]   They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.800]   When Jesus got out of the boat,
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.020]   a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him.
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.140]   Do you see that?
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.740]   There's a man who lives in the tombs
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.560]   and he's walking to meet Jesus.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.940]   He's coming to him.
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.380]   This is the showdown.
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.620]   This is the face off.
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.000]   Let me tell you about the man
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.840]   because the next few verses are gonna go out of their way
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.100]   to show you how bad this dude is,
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.340]   how strong this dude is.
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.860]   This man lived in the tombs
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.620]   and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain.
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.300]   For he had often been chained hand and foot,
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.780]   but he tore the chains apart
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.320]   and broke the irons on his feet.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.460]   No one was strong enough to subdue him.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.860]   Night and day among the tombs and the hills,
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.240]   he would cry out and cut himself with stones.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.880]   Shows up in three gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.440]   And in Matthew and Luke, it says the people avoided him.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.580]   They were afraid of him.
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.820]   The people feared him.
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.780]   This guy is terrifying.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.520]   He's strong.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.500]   There's nothing that can hold him.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.740]   It goes to great details to show you this.
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.220]   And I would tell you that
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.100]   I've been wrestling with this text this week.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.540]   I believe this man exists.
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.840]   He might be in some other part of the city
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.640]   that you don't go to often.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.780]   He's sitting under a bridge.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.780]   Maybe he's roided up out of his mind.
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.620]   He's strong.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.580]   He's depressed.
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.180]   He's addicted.
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.660]   He's breaking beer bottles and cutting himself.
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.540]   He's a cutter.
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.020]   He's streaming out in pain.
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.700]   And we don't care.
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.700]   We don't care.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.940]   We pass by him.
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.780]   We turn the other way.
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.020]   Jesus says, "Boys, get in the boat.
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.860]   "I got work to do."
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.880]   And he goes out of his way to find this one man.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.420]   And the text tells us two things about him.
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.980]   It says he's a slave and he's strong.
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.880]   He's a slave in that he's abandoned.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.720]   He's naked.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.540]   He's bound.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.380]   He's bleeding.
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.060]   He's crying out and he lives among the dead.
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.180]   He lives among the tombs.
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.960]   But the enemy's given him a benefit.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.220]   He's strong.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.980]   He's strengthened.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.180]   And I don't know if he's aware
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.380]   of his spiritual state or not,
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.660]   but I can see this guy as being this
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.700]   really wealthy real estate mogul,
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.140]   this young entrepreneur who's stacked up cash for himself,
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.140]   bought properties, has cars,
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.980]   has a lot of things going for him.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.380]   He's strong and completely blind
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.060]   to the evil he's involved himself in.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.480]   So my first point this evening
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.860]   is the objective of the enemy.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.820]   I want you to know the objective of evil,
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.020]   the objective of Satan,
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.660]   his game plan for you tonight as you sit there.
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.180]   He has one objective.
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.420]   That's to make you a slave to anything other than Christ.
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.900]   To make you a slave to anything other than,
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.940]   to relationships, to identity in relationships,
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.540]   to anorexia, to bulimia, to pornography,
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.980]   to self-righteousness, to legalism,
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.500]   to make you a slave to following the rules,
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.440]   make you a slave to your work.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.900]   Now he will never come to you and is like,
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.840]   hey, you want to make a deal?
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.980]   I'm going to make you a slave to your work.
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.800]   But what he will do is give you a little bit of success
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.940]   and feed something in you,
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.580]   a search for significance in you.
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.060]   So that you find yourself in a place
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:07.060]   where you will sell out everything for success, for success.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:12.860]   He wants to make you abandoned, bound, bleeding, crying out,
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.660]   partying among the dead.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.580]   Says no one could bind him anymore,
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.660]   which means they once could, verse three.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.020]   Says no one could bind him anymore.
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:23.880]   What's interesting about that
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.580]   is once they could tie him up,
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.340]   once they were strong enough to bound him.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.720]   But this guy, he's grown violent and strong and angry.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.360]   I've talked to these people.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.060]   They come up and they're so given to their sin
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.700]   that they react violently, they act angry,
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.420]   and everybody's moving away from them.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.180]   Everybody's shrinking back from them.
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.260]   They've been so given to the evil,
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:53.400]   so handed over to the desires of their heart.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.340]   Because when you feed something, it grows.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.940]   Whenever you feed something, it grows stronger.
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.220]   It's the lie of the one last time.
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.660]   I'm gonna look at porn one last time.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.980]   No, that one last time strengthened that desire.
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.500]   I'm gonna masturbate one last time.
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.300]   No, that one last time fed something in you,
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.780]   an appetite that now is stronger.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.180]   I'm gonna call him one last time.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.380]   No, that one last phone call fed a desire of your heart
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.140]   that is now stronger.
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.660]   It's the lie of one last time.
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.980]   Sin leaves you lonely and hurting,
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.820]   but it might offer a benefit, in this case, strength.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.300]   And the benefit could be blinding.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.620]   Look at how strong I am.
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.840]   Look at how beautiful I am.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.820]   I know I'm anorexic.
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.060]   Look at, I get to experience so much pleasure.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.380]   I'm addicted to pornography,
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.180]   but there's so much pleasure there at my will.
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.260]   Whenever I want it, I know that I'm an addict to shopping,
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:59.140]   but look, I have style, not to mention debt.
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:04.180]   So it offers this benefit, but it's enslaving.
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:08.360]   My friend got back from Turkey last week,
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.500]   and she came over last night,
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.940]   was meeting with my wife, Monica,
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.580]   and she brought us and the children
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.060]   something called Turkish Delight,
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.660]   which if you've heard of Narnia,
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.540]   the lion, witch, and the wardrobe,
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.420]   that is something that is in the movie.
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.260]   It's evidently a real thing.
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.500]   I didn't know, but in the movie,
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.540]   and I'll just tell you the plot.
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.380]   You need to see it.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.940]   It's an excellent movie.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.940]   It's also a book if you prefer reading.
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:34.220]   And so Edmund, right, he gets,
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.620]   the witch feeds him this thing called Turkish Delight,
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.140]   and he eats it and he tastes something.
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.620]   He wants more of it and he wants more of it,
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.460]   so much so that he gets to a place
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.300]   where he will sell out everyone around him
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.460]   just to consume a little more.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.500]   Sounds like a meth addict.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.940]   Sounds like a heroin addict.
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.660]   Sounds like the rich young ruler,
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:59.740]   the man or the woman in uptown, midtown, West Seventh,
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.460]   that just can't get enough.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:06.620]   Wants a little bit more and a little bit more attention.
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.460]   Right?
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:12.460]   See, when you begin to entertain the proposition of sin,
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.860]   sin is just an invitation to worship
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.140]   something other than Jesus.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:18.980]   Write that down.
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.020]   Sin is just an invitation to worship
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.100]   something other than Jesus.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.060]   And when you do that, you invite the possibility
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:30.300]   of becoming a slave to something other than Jesus.
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.380]   When you entertain that worship
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.700]   of something other than Jesus,
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.500]   you invite the possibility of becoming a slave to it.
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.580]   And I've seen this.
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.140]   It's funny when it's an allegory in Narnia,
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.660]   but I had a dear friend of mine
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:48.460]   who lived in uptown above a bar in a high-rise condo
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.620]   dating a swimsuit model.
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.300]   He's a financial advisor, a stockbroker,
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.440]   and everything is going right in the world,
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.060]   and he's living for the party.
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.960]   And he was in the church,
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.420]   but all of a sudden he leaves the church.
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.200]   He stops having time for church.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.380]   He's spending time with his friends, time with his girls,
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.260]   and pushes everyone out of his life that loves him,
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.220]   anyone that would speak truth to him.
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:15.520]   When his family came to town, he was too busy to see them.
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.460]   Abandoned, hurting, but doesn't see it,
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.040]   doesn't realize it,
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.900]   and pushed everyone away who loved him.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.660]   Verse six, "When he saw,"
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.900]   so this showdown's happening, the man is there.
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.340]   It says he's coming to Jesus, okay?
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.460]   This man who no one could subdue, everyone feared him.
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.620]   "When he saw Jesus from a distance,
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.340]   "he ran and fell on his knees in front of him,
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.100]   "and he shouted at the top of his voice,
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.700]   "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.120]   "In God's name, don't torture me."
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.580]   What?
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.020]   There's no lightsabers.
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.300]   There's no duel.
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.220]   There's no sparring.
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.860]   He falls down, which is the position of worship,
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.660]   and he attempts an exorcism.
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.940]   Do you see that, what happens in an exorcism?
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:13.500]   "In the name of Jesus Christ, I, in the name of God, I,"
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.940]   he says, "In the name of God."
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:17.700]   Don't hurt me.
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.780]   Don't hurt me.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.620]   There's no dualism.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.500]   Dualism is a heretical theology
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.780]   that there's God versus evil.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.620]   There's no good versus evil.
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.980]   There's no God versus Satan.
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.140]   They're not dueling on this even platform,
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:38.460]   and God's trying to know his moves, right?
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.060]   God is sovereign over Satan.
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.800]   It's crazy, it's mind-blowing.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.100]   "For Jesus said to him,
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.340]   "'Come out of this man, you impure spirit.'
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.260]   "Then Jesus asked him, 'What is your name?'
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.200]   "'My name is Legion,' he replied, 'for we are many.'"
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.420]   Verse 10, "And he begged Jesus."
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.580]   He begged Jesus again and again
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.360]   not to send them out of the area.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.200]   He begs him.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.960]   "A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.600]   "The demons begged Jesus, 'Send us among the pigs.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.540]   "'Allow us to go into them.'
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:10.180]   "He gave them permission."
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.000]   Underline that word.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.260]   "He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.600]   "and went into the pigs.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.500]   "The herd, about 2,000 in number,
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.100]   "rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned."
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.660]   I always saw this as the pigs
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.180]   jumping off a cliff into the lake.
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.820]   I was just there right where this happened.
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.180]   And it's actually a hillside,
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.180]   and the lake is about 100 yards away.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.180]   So it means the pigs ran down the hillside,
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.700]   ran down the steep bank, and rushed, it says,
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.960]   into the water, which is even crazier
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.620]   than just jumping off a cliff to me.
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.580]   It kinda changed the way that I think about this.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.220]   And so this man who was under the influence
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.100]   of 2,000 demons is no match for Jesus.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.880]   Do you see this crazy scene?
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.620]   You have to see this.
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.280]   He's like, "Will you give us permission?"
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.060]   Could you imagine, like, so just if I'm talking,
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.780]   and I was like, "Yeah, my wife wanted to go to the store,
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.420]   "so I gave her permission."
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:07.140]   [congregation laughing]
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.060]   Like, you guys are gonna be like,
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.560]   "We're out on that, dude."
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.360]   Like, that's rude and disrespectful,
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.200]   and that's all, like, submissive.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.800]   "You gave her permission."
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.580]   Like, this, Jesus is like,
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:23.640]   "Yeah, I guess I give you permission."
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.240]   Do you see the sovereignty over this?
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.360]   Do you see what's occurring?
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.600]   Do you see how strong and how powerful he is
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.400]   that this guy that no one could hold down,
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.840]   in act one, it says everyone was afraid of him.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.000]   In act two, it said he was afraid of Jesus.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.040]   Like, acting completely out of fear.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.040]   "Please don't harm me, Jesus."
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.180]   2,000 demons versing Jesus.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.840]   "Please don't hurt us, Jesus."
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.480]   Doesn't that change everything?
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.560]   My second point is the enemy is no match for Jesus.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.400]   You gotta believe this.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.360]   The enemy is no match for Jesus.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.320]   See, Jesus versus Satan is not like me versus Brandon Slay.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.740]   It's like Brandon Slay versus a kitten, okay?
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.240]   That's what this is like.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.920]   It's like, he's like, "There's no problem here.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.840]   "There's no challenge here."
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.640]   Jesus doesn't lift a fist.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.800]   He doesn't clench a fist.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.680]   He says a few words and the scene is done, problem solved.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.200]   Effortless.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:35.380]   What this is about, I don't know if you have 2,000 demons.
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:39.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.440]   But what I think this is about is Jesus heals someone
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.360]   so much worse off than you.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.720]   And so here's the most prideful thing
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.040]   someone's ever said to me up here.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:50.880]   You ready?
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.200]   The most prideful thing I've ever heard anybody say.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.360]   "Jesus can't help me."
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.200]   What?
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.720]   No, man, you don't, I've been addicted to porn
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.800]   since I was in the fifth grade.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.820]   There's no cure.
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.880]   Have you read?
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.920]   Jesus can't help me.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.920]   You are a prideful, arrogant, lost in your sin,
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.920]   completely consumed by the evil that you fed
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.040]   if you think that your God is so tiny.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.080]   And my God ain't.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.700]   My God's so huge.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.920]   JP, you don't understand the abuse that I've encountered.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.800]   You're right.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.500]   Let me tell you a couple things.
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.440]   One, I've heard it all.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.000]   I think you're gonna be hard-pressed to surprise me.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.880]   And there is some crazy, wicked evil in the world.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.680]   My God is so much bigger.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.480]   He will restore you, he will heal you,
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.520]   he will use you, he will set you free.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.600]   And he will change the world through you if you let him.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.200]   And if you think I'm just talking, I've seen him do it.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.640]   I see him do it all the time.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:10.640]   I mean, molestation, rape, terrible, unspeakable,
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:15.840]   sex slavery, heroin, addiction, methamphetamine,
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.340]   addiction, and all of those things combined.
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:24.400]   I've seen him set 'em free and use 'em,
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.440]   give 'em joy, restore their spirit.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.520]   2000 demons right here.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.760]   So this is a miracle, clearly a miracle
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.720]   just like every single conversion is a miracle,
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:42.680]   is an amazing, supernatural act of God
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.440]   that you were headed for hell and he came into your life
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.320]   and changed your heart and gave you an appetite for him.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.000]   C.S. Lewis said it like this about his own conversion.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.120]   As he looked in the mirror, he wrote,
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.520]   "In surprised by joy, C.S. Lewis said,
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.480]   he wrote, "In surprised by joy, C.S. Lewis also wrote,
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.480]   "Narnia," what I referenced earlier,
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.420]   he said about himself, "For the first time,
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:07.500]   "I examined myself with a seriously practical purpose
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.520]   "and there I found what appalled me,
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:15.000]   "a zoo of lust, a bedlam of ambitions,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   "a nursery of fears, a harem of fondled hatreds.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.800]   "My name was Legion."
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.840]   I really relate to that.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.520]   And so I don't have a lot of time here,
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.400]   but just quickly to try to answer some of your questions.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.160]   Jesus casted out a demon, demons, 2,000 demons,
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.300]   sent them into pigs.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.200]   Why into pigs?
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.040]   Why is that in here?
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.240]   Let me tell you why that's in here, because it happened.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.840]   There is no reason in the world
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.560]   that anybody would be in a creative writing class
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.240]   like where do we wanna send the demons?
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.860]   Let's send them into the pigs.
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:53.000]   But no, Matthew, Mark, and Luke saw it happen
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.120]   and wrote it down and it's crazy, okay?
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.120]   And it's written down because it happened and they saw it
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.040]   and they were like, "We gotta tell somebody about the pigs.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.120]   "This is crazy."
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.040]   And so that's why it's in here.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.160]   And so why don't we call out demons?
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.800]   Like you probably, if you've been here long,
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.080]   you've probably never seen me say,
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.440]   "In the name of Jesus Christ, I cast you out."
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.720]   And I've wrestled with that before.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.560]   I'll tell you, my really quick answer to this
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.560]   is because Jesus gives us a better way.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.480]   See, I think, especially as young adults,
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.480]   like we wanna conjure up the power,
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.840]   we don't study church history,
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.760]   we come in, we think we found something great,
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.940]   we stepped into a church and we have embraced the theology
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.160]   and we love the supernatural and we're obsessed with it.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.960]   And so we think that you can like pray
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.420]   or you can cast it out.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:45.760]   You can pray, you know, boring spiritual discipline,
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:49.960]   or you can get loud and I was in Haiti once in Africa
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.600]   and you won't believe in it rolling down.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.920]   I've been there, I've seen it, okay?
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.680]   Let me tell you what Jesus says, Matthew,
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.160]   I'm sorry, Mark chapter nine, verse 26.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.400]   There's a man whose son is possessed by a demon
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.480]   and he's throwing him into fire,
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.860]   throwing him into water, trying to drown him.
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.100]   And the disciples go to him and say,
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.880]   "In the name of Jesus Christ, I call you out."
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.160]   And nothing happens.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.760]   And so the man goes to Jesus and says,
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.240]   "They tried to cast out a demon, but nothing happened."
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.680]   And Jesus says this, it says,
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.240]   "The spirit shrieked and convulsed him."
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.600]   Jesus cast it out, "Convulsed him violently.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.840]   "And he came out and the boy looked so much like a corpse
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.560]   "that many said he's dead.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.480]   "But Jesus took him by the hand
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.840]   "and lifted him to his feet and stood up.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.160]   "And after Jesus had gone indoors,
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.700]   "his disciples came to him and asked him privately,
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.920]   "'Why couldn't we drive it out?'
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.060]   "And he replied, "'Because this one
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.000]   "'only comes out by prayer.'"
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.460]   He says, "You got two options.
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:43.500]   "You and your power can call and say,
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.340]   "'In the name of Jesus, I,'
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.720]   "or you can go to God,
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.800]   "the one who 2,000 demons just fell down and worshiped
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.920]   "and say, 'Will you?'"
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:57.320]   And Jesus right here, and read it for your own eyes
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.120]   in case you are tempted not to believe me,
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.440]   says, "That's a better way.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.260]   "That's a stronger, more powerful way.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.960]   "And we hate that.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.420]   "If you are like me in my flesh, you're like,
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.120]   "No, don't just give me the boring spiritual disciplines.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.620]   "Give me something crazy.
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:17.040]   "'Cause I'm crazy."
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.620]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.720]   You can tell it to come out,
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.680]   or you can turn to the one who overpowered 2,000 demons
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.800]   and say, "Hey, will you do something over there?"
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.560]   And Jesus says, "Hey, do that."
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.120]   The really difficult kind,
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.380]   you need to call on something bigger than yourself.
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.800]   And so, whatever your addiction is,
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.420]   your body image, your pornography,
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.700]   whatever you're stuck in, whatever you can't get out of,
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.760]   you're fighting something stronger than you,
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.320]   but you're not fighting anything stronger than God.
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.760]   And you need to turn to God,
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.220]   devote yourselves to the teachings, to prayer,
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.840]   to the breaking of the bread, to the spiritual disciplines,
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.040]   to the studying his word,
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.480]   to writing his word on your heart,
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.640]   to holding fast to a better promise.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.100]   And you say, "Is there just something quick, though?"
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.520]   No.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.020]   I mean, God could do it quick, for sure.
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.160]   But more times than not, he says,
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.600]   "No, step into a process
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.100]   "where you actually get to know me,
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.420]   "and we can have a relationship,
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.960]   "and you're not just looking for an aspirin."
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.180]   You say, "Well, why, but Jesus cast it out."
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:22.140]   That's right, you're not Jesus.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.140]   There is something unique happening
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:29.500]   with Jesus and his apostles here
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:34.380]   where the miracles are constantly authenticating the message.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:39.060]   I mean, he's talking to evil forces.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.780]   He's communicating with them, and they're talking back,
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:46.000]   and there's something unique happening here.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.840]   And if you don't believe me,
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.680]   there's a place in the scripture where the disciples said,
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.600]   "Hey, there's this guy casting out a demon in your name,
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.280]   "but we asked him to stop."
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:28:00.360]   And here in Acts 19, verse 13,
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.720]   some Jews went around driving out evil spirits,
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.680]   tried, some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.000]   tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.480]   over those who were demon-possessed.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.280]   They would say, "In the name of the Jesus
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.780]   "whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out."
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.340]   Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest,
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.100]   were doing this, and so this Jewish chief priest,
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.580]   Sceva, has seven sons.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.140]   They're going out, they're casting out demons
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.060]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.020]   And one day, the evil spirit answered them,
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:30.760]   "Jesus, I know, and Paul, I know about, but who are you?"
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.660]   The man who had the evil spirit jumped on them,
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.180]   overpowered them all.
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.360]   He gave them such a beating, gotta love that.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.460]   He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house,
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.480]   naked and bleeding.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:48.040]   Seven men run into a fight, seven men run out
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.580]   with no clothes on, and they're bleeding.
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:50.780]   They lost, that's what that means.
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:51.620]   Let me tell you what that means.
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.700]   In the Greek, that translates, they lost.
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.340]   They did not win the fight.
[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.060]   And so I would not recommend you going around
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.580]   commanding demons to come out.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:03.220]   I would recommend you pray, and you fast,
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.320]   and you share truth, because this is a truth encounter.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.780]   This is a truth encounter.
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.940]   When the disciples came up to Jesus, and they say,
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.260]   "Hey, this man's casting out demons, your name."
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.140]   He said, and they said, "But we stop him."
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.780]   Jesus said, "You don't need to stop them."
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.420]   Not because, "Hey, I want them to do that,"
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.340]   or, "I hope that they do that."
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.340]   He never commands us to do that.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.060]   He says, "But if he's doing that,
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.460]   "then he can't preach against me.
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.780]   "He can't come later and say, 'Crucify him.'"
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:35.220]   And so here's what this text is telling us,
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.740]   is that there is a condition that you cannot recover from
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.060]   apart from Jesus.
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.060]   There is a condition that exists in humans
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.580]   that cannot be recovered from apart from Jesus.
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.260]   You will never, ever be well apart from Jesus.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:49.580]   When I first wrote that down, I was like,
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.300]   "Man, that's profound, and it's gonna go viral on Twitter
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.140]   "and be amazing."
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:53.980]   And then I thought about it again,
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.260]   and I was like, "Yeah, it's called sin."
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.540]   There's nothing profound about that,
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.940]   that the sin that we were born into,
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:03.260]   we cannot recover from apart from Jesus.
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:09.180]   This Sunday, I took my family to eat
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.420]   on Lower Greenville.
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.300]   Took the girls, Presley and Finley,
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.740]   and my wife and Weston, three kids and Monica,
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.180]   and we're walking into the restaurant,
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.380]   and there's this man sitting there in the back
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:26.900]   on the street near the restaurant, big dude, dreadlocks,
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.700]   tattoos on his face, and I just said,
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:31.540]   "Hey, what's up, man?"
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.860]   He says, "Hi," and we go in, we eat,
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.580]   and about an hour and a half later, we come out,
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.100]   and he's still sitting there.
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.740]   Tell him hi again.
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:42.940]   He says, "Hey, can you spare some change?"
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.540]   And I say, I go, and I'm thinking,
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.260]   I'm always trying to assess the need,
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.740]   and how do I meet the need, and what is the need?
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.420]   Is the need money, what is the need?
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.620]   So I begin to have a conversation with him,
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.020]   and if I'm honest with you, like in my flesh,
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.700]   I'm like, "This is gonna be an incredible,
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.540]   "teachable moment."
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.380]   I'm like, "Come around, kids.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.500]   "Daddy's about to share the gospel.
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.340]   "Get a pen."
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.740]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:04.580]   And I'm like, "What's your name?"
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.820]   And he's like, "My name is Legion."
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.660]   No, he didn't say that.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.540]   He said, (congregation laughing)
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.940]   he said, "My name is Carl."
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.100]   And I said, "Hi, Carl."
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.460]   And we're having this great conversation, Carl and I,
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.220]   and Carl has a cross tattoo right here on his forehead,
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:23.180]   and I say, you know, we're talking, everything's fine,
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.020]   everything's lucid.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.540]   I say, "Carl, tell me about that tattoo."
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.900]   And he goes, "Well, you know how many rings
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.660]   "are around Saturn?"
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.300]   And I was like, "Man, science class seven, maybe?
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.140]   "I'm not sure."
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.740]   And he says, "Well, if you take the first ring
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.180]   "and you make it a screwdriver
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.260]   "and you stick it right here inside my head
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.660]   "and I pull it out, what am I gonna do with it?"
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:48.740]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.180]   I'm like, "Is this a test?"
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.220]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.020]   No, I'm like, "Hey, kids, go back to the car."
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.020]   Like, where is the screwdriver, Carl?
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:02.020]   And, and, and we're laughing, and it's fun here,
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.660]   but it's really heartbreaking, honestly.
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:12.540]   And I talked to Carl a minute longer
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:17.540]   and invited him here, and the conversation, you know,
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:21.540]   got kinda weird, as if it could get weirder,
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.220]   and we got in the truck, and my little girl, Presley,
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.100]   you know, just the innocence of a child,
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.300]   says, "Daddy, you should've given him money
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.820]   "to go to the spa."
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.300]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.980]   And I said, in response, I don't say that
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.380]   to doggone him at all, it's just what happened.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:41.380]   And I said, "Presley, Carl needs something
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:47.500]   "so much more than what Daddy can do right now.
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.560]   "Carl doesn't need to be cleaned on the outside,
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.940]   "Carl needs to be cleaned on the inside.
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.940]   "Carl needs to be washed on the inside.
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.700]   "Carl's been given over to his sin.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.520]   "He's indulged in something for so long,
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.720]   "that it's completely consumed him and overpowered him.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.400]   "And so we just need to pray for Carl."
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.460]   And it's interesting that I wrote down in this outline,
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.160]   before that happened, and in my mind,
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.120]   I didn't connect the dots, I said, "This man exists.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.760]   "You know, he's in Dallas, he lives somewhere."
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.800]   And I never even connected, then God placed him
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.840]   right in front of me.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:27.500]   He needs something more powerful than me.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.920]   He needs the one that was so powerful
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.640]   that he changed me on those same streets.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.960]   I was on Lower Greenville when someone
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.000]   invited me to this place.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.760]   I was in the bar right there beside where we ate.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.120]   When someone said, "Hey, will you come to church
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:41.960]   "with me tomorrow?"
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.240]   I sat right back there.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.440]   We met in high school at the time, hungover.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.420]   And the Spirit of God began to make me new, verse 14.
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:54.420]   Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.240]   in the town and countryside.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.720]   And the people went out to see what happened
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.200]   when they came to Jesus, they saw the man
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.880]   who had been possessed by the legion of demons
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.920]   sitting there dressed in his right mind,
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.160]   and they were afraid.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.080]   And I see this all the time.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.440]   Like, just the other day, like a couple weeks ago,
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.600]   I'm talking to this guy, and he's like in a polo,
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.280]   tucked in, khaki shorts, like clean-cut dude,
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.920]   and we're talking, and he's like, "Yeah, I was a drug dealer
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.920]   "on the streets, and this, and that, and whatever."
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.400]   And I'm like, "Bro, what happened to you?"
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.040]   He's like, "Jesus changed my life."
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:24.880]   Yes, he did.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.040]   Yes, he did.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.520]   Those who had seen it told the people
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.400]   what had happened to the demon-possessed man
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.880]   and told about the pigs as well.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.000]   Then the people began to plead with Jesus
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.840]   to leave their region.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.040]   Why?
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.680]   Why did they say, "Jesus, you gotta leave"?
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.500]   Why?
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.040]   Because he cost them something.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.080]   A couple hundred thousand dollars in pigs and swine.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.360]   They're like, "You gotta get out of here."
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.520]   They didn't care about the man,
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.520]   they didn't care about his health.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.240]   What about our pigs, man?
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.240]   Get out!
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.000]   (pages flipping)
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.360]   Verse 18, "As Jesus was getting into the boat,
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:03.620]   "the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.060]   "Jesus did not let him, but said,
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.060]   "Go home to your own people,
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.080]   "and tell them how much the Lord has done for you,
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.960]   "and how much he has had mercy on you.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.760]   "So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.580]   "how much Jesus had done for him,
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.720]   "and all the people were amazed."
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.920]   If you were here last week, you saw the rich, young ruler
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.120]   say, "Hey, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.040]   Jesus says, "Come with me," and he leaves sad.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.480]   "I can't sell everything and come with you."
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.920]   This man says, "Jesus, I wanna go with you, please."
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.260]   Jesus says, "No, you stay here.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.760]   "You reach these people."
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.400]   And there he is, it's like,
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.520]   "Bro, is that you?
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.580]   "We went to high school together.
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.060]   "You're the demon-possessed man, right?
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.280]   "You're the crazy one, you've been living in the tomb.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.960]   "Why are you so normal?"
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.800]   Jesus.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.920]   Jesus, that's amazing.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.160]   That's amazing, you've changed so much.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.420]   Jesus, this man, Jesus came in and he changed me.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:07.380]   So my third and final point is the objective of Jesus.
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.120]   The objective of Jesus.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:14.600]   Jesus' objective is to save people, to set them free.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.200]   That's what he does, that's what he's really good at.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.040]   He's a savior, he saves people.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.640]   He sees people in need, he runs to them.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.120]   He's here, he's hanging out with his boys in Capernaum,
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.540]   and he's like, "Hey, we gotta go.
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.220]   "Since he's the Lord God Almighty,
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.800]   "there's a dude who needs me, we gotta go."
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.360]   You're here, he knows about you.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:38.560]   He knows about right where you're at, he knows everything.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.360]   He knows about the images on the computer,
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.920]   the date that went too far, he knows about everything.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:48.120]   The thoughts, the deeds, the work, the acts, the addictions.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.840]   He knows about it all.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.680]   And he's coming for you.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.240]   You're like, "No, he's not coming for me."
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.920]   Where are you right now?
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.240]   Look around you.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:03.480]   He's coming for you, he's winning.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.360]   You have no hope against him.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:10.520]   Check this out.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:15.520]   When Jesus wants to save people, he saves a person.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.320]   How true is that?
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.600]   When Jesus wants to save people, he saves a person.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.160]   You think about the apostles.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:23.980]   He wants to do work.
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:27.200]   Hey, come here, you guys, come here, 11 guys, right?
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.560]   Come here, I'm gonna change your life, set you free.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:35.560]   The apostle Paul, who was an outspoken person
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.320]   against Christianity, Jesus comes in his life,
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.520]   changes him, and he does ministry to the very people
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.920]   that he was speaking against Christianity with.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:50.260]   You think about, I mean, I go on, St. Patrick, a drunk,
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.600]   goes back to a bunch of drunks and tells them
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.200]   about the man who changed his life, St. Augustine.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   I could go on and on and on.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.680]   When often Jesus wants to save people with struggles,
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.960]   he saves someone with that struggle.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.560]   I see it all the time.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.360]   He takes a mess and he gives them a message.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.080]   He takes a mess and he makes a message
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.080]   that furthers his message, which is the gospel message.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.920]   You come up to me afterwards and you get the courage
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.840]   to say, hey, I gotta tell you something.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.960]   There's this thing that I've never told anyone.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:19.880]   It's killing me.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.040]   I thought I'd never deal with it,
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.160]   but once upon a time, I had an abortion.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.480]   I'm gonna say, stop, time out.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.200]   First of all, God loves you.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.160]   Second of all, let me introduce you to my friend.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.040]   She's been there.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:35.040]   She's done the same thing, and now God has created
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.660]   this incredible ministry around her.
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.920]   He's taken that mess and made it a message.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.240]   He's redeeming it.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.580]   He's gonna do that to you.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:45.420]   Right?
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:50.220]   I mean, I talk about my pornography addiction
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.980]   that God has set me free from all the time,
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:56.060]   sexual addiction, alcoholism, drug use.
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.820]   And so what happens, the number one thing
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.500]   that I'm told after these messages is somebody comes up,
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.620]   the number one thing I hear over and over and over,
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.500]   dude, my story's just like yours.
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.540]   I know.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:11.300]   That's why God would have me talk to you,
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.100]   and that's why he's gonna have you talk to them.
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.500]   That's what he does.
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.340]   That's the way this thing works, right?
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:20.220]   I mean, this is the way the gospel spreads.
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.220]   He takes a mess, he gives them a message.
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.060]   Jesus wants to save people.
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:26.020]   He saves a person.
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:29.900]   He wants to save people at your work, so he saves you.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.540]   He wants to save people in your community,
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:32.520]   so he put you there.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.980]   He saved you and put you there.
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.900]   That's what he does.
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.540]   This is the way this thing advances.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.720]   This is the way the gospel moves forward.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.540]   And so the application this evening
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.500]   is who did Jesus save you for?
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:45.380]   Who are your people?
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.660]   Who did he save you for?
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.140]   Because do you know that once the cap
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.540]   came off Jesus's ministry,
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.580]   once he's headed to the cross, listen to this,
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:56.460]   he never saved a single person just to save that person.
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.420]   Did you hear me?
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:02.420]   Jesus never saved a single person just to save that person.
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:07.100]   You think about just even the thief on the cross.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:07.980]   Remember the thief on the cross?
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:10.620]   Jesus is there in the middle, guy here, guy here.
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:15.080]   This dude trusts Christ and shares the gospel
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.780]   with the only person he can.
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:18.860]   How crazy is that?
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.320]   I mean, he's got one person, he's about to die.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.540]   Jesus says, "You're gonna be with me
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:23.620]   "and my father and my kingdom."
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:26.780]   Hey, man, do you not see who he is?
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:30.740]   Jesus has never saved a person just to save that person.
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:34.100]   He's always saved a person to save people.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.680]   Give your life to that, family.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.280]   Give your life to that, friend.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.480]   That's why we're here.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.320]   Let's see this movement take over the world.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.880]   Let's see it consume the world.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.080]   I don't know if you look around you, man,
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.320]   we're in a world of hurt.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.520]   What are you doing?
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.520]   What are you doing?
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:57.220]   Don't just sit on this thing, man.
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.660]   Don't keep it to yourself.
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.360]   Sometimes people reject it
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.120]   based on what it's gonna cost them.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:07.600]   2,000 pigs, but in Acts 19,
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.960]   you compare that to Acts 19 in the church of Ephesus,
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.120]   the same Acts 19 that I read earlier,
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.400]   seven sons of Sceva.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.360]   It says that witches and sorcerers were coming
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:20.320]   with $5 million in scrolls burning them
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.320]   because they found something greater in Christ.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.320]   There's some people that are like,
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.640]   "Nah, it's gonna cost me too much."
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.560]   Dude, I see you.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.800]   You don't have sex anymore, bro.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.820]   I'm out on that.
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:29.840]   No, man, you're not fun anymore.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.480]   You don't go to the bar or the club with us anymore.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.060]   Dude, I'm not into that.
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:34.960]   No, you're too prude these days, bro.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.520]   You're not any fun anymore.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.440]   But there's some people that,
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.800]   man, there's something different about you
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.920]   I gotta have for myself, man.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.760]   What is that?
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.920]   I gotta give me some of that.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.160]   It's like some people are gonna,
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.200]   what about the pigs, bro?
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.660]   We're out, get outta here.
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.880]   And some people are just gonna be amazed.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:52.720]   I hear it all the time.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.320]   I'm up here, I'm like, I always ask people,
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.880]   "How'd you get to the poor?"
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.840]   Dude, I went to school with this girl.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.880]   She was a total B, and then I ran into her.
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.080]   That's your words, not mine, okay?
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:01.920]   Don't judge me.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.000]   [congregation laughing]
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   I'm always like, "Wow, that's courageous."
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.160]   [congregation laughing]
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:11.160]   And then I ran into her, and she was different.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.080]   She was so different.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.100]   She was kind and compassionate and joyful,
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:17.360]   and she invited me here, and so I came.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.440]   Guys are like, "Man."
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.280]   I'm like, "How'd you get here?"
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.880]   They're like, "Dude, I went to school with this guy.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.360]   "He was a bully, and they usually use some choice words."
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:28.000]   And then I saw him, and he was in his right mind
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.080]   and clothed, and--
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.080]   [congregation laughing]
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.400]   And he's like, "Come to the porch with me."
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.360]   I'm like, "Okay, I'm amazed, okay."
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.560]   That's what happens.
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.680]   That's what happened.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.560]   I mean, sometimes he comes for the worst.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:43.600]   You're here, and you're like, "No, I'm too far gone."
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.760]   What an arrogant, prideful statement.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:50.560]   This guy, he didn't have an exorcism ministry.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.800]   He just went and told people what had happened to him,
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.640]   that he was made new.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.560]   He didn't go forward and be like,
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.880]   "Okay, I'm casting out demons now."
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.840]   He just said, "No, man, Jesus changed me.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:04.000]   "And Jesus saved him to get them."
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.760]   How powerful is this?
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.040]   You're gonna be in heaven with this guy.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.600]   If you're here and you're a follower of Christ,
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.520]   you'll probably meet this guy.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:12.600]   And not just this guy, but a bunch of people from this city.
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.440]   You're gonna be up there, and like, "Hey, how are you?
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.280]   "How'd you get here?"
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.160]   And they'll be like, "Oh, man, the crazy demon man
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:21.200]   "came up to us and told us about Jesus, and here we are.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.440]   "We've been here for 2,000 years waiting on you.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.440]   "It's amazing."
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:30.640]   I talked to Brandon Slay yesterday, the wrestler,
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.400]   and just said, "Hey, can I tell the story?"
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.400]   And here's the crazy thing about that,
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.360]   as I think about it.
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.600]   So we worked here together.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.960]   He was like, "I wanna give my life to vocational ministry."
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.360]   And as we worked here together, he thought,
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:43.280]   "You know what, I'd be more effective
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.000]   "doing what God made me to do."
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.280]   And so he moved to Colorado.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:50.000]   He works at the Olympic Training Center,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.360]   training Olympians and discipling them.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.440]   I mean, some of you, I've met people here
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.040]   who have been discipled by him that now serve with us here,
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.160]   because he's like, "Those are my people.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.100]   "I've gotta go back to my people.
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.880]   "I was a crazy, lost guy.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.640]   "God took this athlete, he did something amazing.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.480]   "He made me one in a billion good.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.120]   "And so now I've gotta go back to people
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.460]   "who are one in a billion good
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:15.240]   "and tell them about this great God."
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:16.720]   And when I talked to him yesterday, he said,
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.900]   "Man, that's absolutely true.
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:21.480]   "And now I'm going to the University of Pennsylvania
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:26.480]   "where I wrestled to coach and to tell people about Jesus.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.560]   "I've gotta use the gifts and the talents
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.240]   "that the Lord entrusted to me
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.240]   "to make this God more famous."
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.560]   Who are your people, friends?
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.160]   Who does God wanna save through you?
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.820]   Who did God change you for?
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:43.820]   And so, in summary,
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:49.960]   Satan may offer you power in order to make you a slave.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.140]   That's his objective, to make you a slave.
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:57.200]   When Jesus wants to save people, he sets someone free.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.940]   And the objective of Jesus is to set you free.
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:07.940]   I don't know how well you know the gospel,
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:09.660]   just the good news.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:10.680]   It's the great exchange.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.500]   The easiest way I know how to explain the gospel to people
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.960]   is just to say that Jesus got what you deserve,
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.860]   which is he was tortured, an eternal God in a moment.
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.120]   In eternity of torture, that's what you deserve.
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.420]   That's what your sin deserves.
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:27.420]   Jesus, an eternal God, is the only one on the planet,
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.020]   the only one ever created who could endure that,
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.620]   not created, begotten,
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:32.940]   who could endure that.
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:35.600]   And he endured that on your behalf.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.080]   And so, if you trust in that, you get what he deserves.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.420]   That's the great exchange.
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.780]   It's a very simple way to share the gospel.
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:43.380]   Christ got what you deserve.
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.320]   You get what he deserves.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.180]   He traded places with you.
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:52.800]   He traded places with you.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.620]   You see what happened here?
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:58.340]   You see what happened in this story?
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.220]   Jesus traded places with this guy.
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.760]   He went to him.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.800]   Like, think about Jesus in Capernaum,
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.780]   and he's just like, man, I gotta go get this guy.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.640]   Man, I gotta go to Frisco.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.240]   I gotta go to Uptown.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.220]   Gotta go to Midtown.
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.240]   Gotta go to Lower Greenville.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.520]   Gotta go to West Seventh.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.880]   Gotta go to Como.
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:29.600]   Gotta go to Plano, to Addison.
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.740]   I've gotta go see about someone.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:38.800]   Goes, and he pursues, and he overcomes evil.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.360]   And let me show you something amazing.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.240]   He trades places with him.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:49.680]   'Cause there, Jesus was abandoned,
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:55.680]   naked, bound, bleeding, in pain,
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:01.480]   crying out, living among the tombs.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.320]   Do you see that?
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.600]   He traded places with him.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.200]   There he was, bound, naked, bleeding, tortured,
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.380]   in the tombs with the dead.
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.440]   There he was, traded places with this guy.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.760]   He did this for you.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.440]   He endured the punishment that you deserve
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.960]   to give you the life that he deserves.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.720]   An eternal God, a perfect being,
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:23.760]   someone who has never sinned, never done wrong.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.000]   And he says, you can have everything
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.520]   that my father wants to give me
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.800]   because you trusted that I took on everything
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.400]   that is coming to you.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:38.320]   And you, don't you dare think for one second
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.080]   that you're beyond his reach, or that your sin is too big.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.100]   That is the most prideful statement you can make.
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:47.240]   It's the most prideful thought that you could have,
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.560]   is that a God who can, with his voice,
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.840]   take care of 2,000 demons,
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.880]   can't save you right now.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.920]   I mean, you go home tonight, you take your computer
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:02.800]   and you throw it out the window.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:06.960]   Take your phone and throw it in the garbage.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.680]   You take that dude's number and you delete it
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.700]   and you block it.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.760]   Okay, you go in the liquor cabinet
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.640]   and you throw them all away.
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:19.800]   You go to the magazines that you obsess over
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.560]   and find identity in, and why can't I look like her?
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.440]   And you cut them up and you put them in the garbage
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.640]   and you say, I'm a new creation.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.440]   I trusted in Jesus Christ that he died for my sins.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:34.120]   And that God, who's all powerful, raised him from the dead.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.720]   What can overcome him?
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:43.200]   What can overcome him, huh?
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:46.360]   Nothing.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.840]   Not a thing.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:54.520]   And if you're the worst person in the room, awesome.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:58.440]   That's who he's after.
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:01.000]   And if you're the best person in the room,
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.140]   you're self-righteous.
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:05.160]   And he's after you too.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.480]   Let me pray.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:10.760]   God, we need you.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:15.360]   Can't do this without you.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:19.800]   We can't save ourselves.
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.080]   We're cutting ourselves.
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:27.320]   Focused on what we're not, what we don't have.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:31.240]   Can't do it alone.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.040]   Jesus, we need you.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.080]   Would you come into our lives?
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.160]   Would you make us new?
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.920]   We confess we're sinners.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.320]   We ran from you.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.200]   We've obsessed with all the wrong things.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.840]   We've given ourselves to sin.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.000]   We've worshiped other things than you.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.160]   Jesus, we're sorry.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.000]   We repent.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.480]   We turn from that.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:55.520]   Would you make our lives new?
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:50:01.040]   Would you restore in us a conviction of your Holy Spirit?
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:04.880]   Would you guide us and would you lead us?
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:10.160]   In the name of your great and holy precious son,
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.240]   Jesus Christ, amen.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:16.240]   Let me answer the question.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.080]   Nothing.
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:22.560]   Nothing.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:28.520]   No height, nor depth, nor angels, nor demons,
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:32.400]   any principalities, any rulers, any authorities,
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.880]   nothing in all creation.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:38.160]   Kiss that hand and kiss that God.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:41.000]   Done, period.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.500]   (congregation applauding)
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:49.920]   And so if you're trying to fight something stronger than you
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:53.800]   call on the one stronger than it, okay?
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.520]   Period.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:00.520]   Don't try to walk into that ring unarmed without Jesus.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:06.240]   Okay, it will not work.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.240]   That will not go well for you.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:18.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
