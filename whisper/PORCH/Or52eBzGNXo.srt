1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,640
 - Hey, hey, Porch, how we doing?

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,840
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,680
 Yeah.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,720
 It's great to be here with my friends in Dallas

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,760
 and Fort Worth and spread all over Texas

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,560
 and the Southwest and every other place you're listening.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,640
 We know around the globe and overseas,

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,680
 you're tracking with us.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,520
 My name is Todd.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,000
 I love when I get to jump in with you guys.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,080
 And we are going to just this week,

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,560
 take a little bit of time,

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,600
 looking at a section of God's word

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,920
 that has really, really been useful in my life.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,120
 I often get asked the question,

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,880
 what's your favorite book of the Bible?

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,200
 And so for me, if I had to be honest,

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,620
 it really is, and I say this all the time,

20
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,920
 it's whatever book I'm studying

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,040
 because there's always more there than I think.

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,040
 I mean, books that I've been around for a long time,

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,920
 when I really begin to just sit on them

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,920
 and study and reflect and ask questions,

25
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,040
 man, I always see so much truth

26
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,080
 that I either missed the first time

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,880
 or just forgot was there.

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,720
 So whatever book I'm spending the most time in,

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,320
 at any given time, when I'm teaching through some series

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,520
 at Watermark, wherever it might be,

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,480
 that becomes my favorite book.

32
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,840
 But if I had to just say this one book

33
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,680
 that has been the most useful in my life,

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,560
 not in order to help me understand my own sin

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,840
 and my own need for Jesus,

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,280
 but a book that has changed me

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,220
 more than any other book in the Bible,

38
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,960
 it would be a book called Proverbs.

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,000
 And it's a book that is written for idiots like me

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,200
 of a very short attention span

41
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,560
 because it kind of just speaks to you in jabs

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,480
 and quick punches and little pithy statements.

43
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,600
 This is the way the book of Proverbs starts.

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,920
 Listen to this.

45
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,640
 This is chapter one of a collection of wisdom sayings.

46
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,840
 Okay, now wisdom, all wisdom is,

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,000
 is knowledge wrapped up in understanding,

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,640
 which is to say a life that takes truth

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,000
 and rightly applies it is a life that's marked by wisdom.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,640
 This is what it says.

51
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,200
 It says the Proverbs of Solomon,

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,520
 who if you know the story about Solomon,

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,280
 he could ask God whatever he wanted.

54
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,640
 And what he asked for was that he would have wisdom,

55
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,000
 that he would not just know things.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,060
 'Cause here's the deal, right?

57
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,580
 Most of you guys know more

58
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,020
 than you're applying to your life already.

59
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,880
 Look, we all know what we're supposed to eat

60
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,760
 if we wanna feel like and look like we wanna feel like

61
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,240
 and look like.

62
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,160
 That doesn't mean we always eat that way,

63
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,840
 exercise that way.

64
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,920
 We all know a lot of times what's good for us

65
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,960
 and we just don't apply it correctly to our lives.

66
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,160
 And so what Solomon asked for was wisdom.

67
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,540
 He didn't just want intellectual understanding.

68
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,960
 He wanted intellectual truth applied.

69
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,240
 And so he says this, this is why I wrote this.

70
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,200
 So this is why this has been a book that's good for me.

71
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,720
 To know wisdom and instruction,

72
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,280
 that you might know wisdom and you might be instructed,

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,560
 you might discern the sayings of understanding

74
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,400
 so that you can receive instruction in wise behavior,

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
 righteousness, justice, and equity.

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,920
 In other words, so you won't screw your life up.

77
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,020
 So you won't have more scars than joy.

78
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,680
 It'll give you prudence.

79
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,360
 It doesn't say it'll make you a prude.

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,080
 It says it'll give you prudence,

81
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,080
 which means wise living,

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,840
 the ability to do the right thing

83
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,640
 at the right time in the right way.

84
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,640
 And then it says a wise man will hear

85
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,360
 and increase in learning and a man of understanding

86
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,240
 will acquire wise counsel.

87
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,400
 You'll understand a proverb and a figure,

88
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,840
 the words of their wives and their riddles.

89
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,040
 'Cause sometimes when you read this,

90
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,600
 it doesn't quite make sense.

91
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,520
 You're like, what's that mean?

92
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,560
 I gotta pick the lock on that.

93
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,000
 And all through Proverbs,

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,560
 you're gonna find out what God's trying to do

95
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,340
 because he's a loving father.

96
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,420
 And see, I didn't know that for a long time.

97
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,080
 This was my view of God,

98
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,240
 that everything I wanted to do,

99
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,800
 he was gonna say, get your hands off that.

100
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,920
 And everything I didn't wanna do,

101
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,780
 he's like, get out of bed, let's go.

102
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,620
 And I was like, really?

103
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,100
 I mean, I don't think that's what I want.

104
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,740
 And that was because I made God in my own image.

105
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,340
 I never really stopped and asked God who God was.

106
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,000
 I never listened to what God said he was.

107
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,380
 I never let him reveal himself to me.

108
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,340
 This book is revelation.

109
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,140
 It's showing me what I otherwise would know.

110
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,900
 Because even though I'm made in God's image,

111
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,380
 I've left him.

112
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,500
 And so what I usually do in my broken and fallen state

113
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,140
 is I make God in my image.

114
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,420
 And God's not broken.

115
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,420
 God's not selfish.

116
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,340
 And God's not impetuous.

117
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,860
 And God's not controlling.

118
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,800
 He's sovereign.

119
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,720
 And he loves me.

120
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,500
 And he loves you.

121
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,860
 So we put together this amazing book.

122
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,380
 Listen, listen to these little pleadings.

123
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,200
 This is Proverbs chapter 22 in verse 17.

124
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,040
 He just says this.

125
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,900
 This is a loving father,

126
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,580
 and he's just begging you to just tune in.

127
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,080
 He's saying, incline your ear

128
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,020
 and hear the words of the wise.

129
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,320
 Because I'm not looking to rip you off.

130
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,780
 I'm looking to set you free

131
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,700
 and apply your mind to my knowledge because I love you.

132
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,500
 It will be pleasant if you keep them within you.

133
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,860
 See, let me just tell you something.

134
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,580
 If when you think of following God,

135
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,700
 if you don't think of pleasant and good things,

136
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,380
 then you have been deceived,

137
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,060
 just like I was for a long time.

138
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,160
 That's what the deceiver is.

139
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,000
 He's a liar.

140
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,340
 He's been a liar from the beginning.

141
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,180
 And he always wants you to believe that God's not good,

142
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,120
 his words not true,

143
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,660
 and disobeying him is not gonna cost you that much.

144
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,860
 So listen to this pleading.

145
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,720
 So that you may trust the Lord,

146
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,980
 the Lord who is slow to anger,

147
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,100
 bounding in loving kindness,

148
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,620
 compassionate, gracious,

149
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,140
 full of grace and truth.

150
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,180
 He says, I've taught you today, even today,

151
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,580
 have I not written to you excellent things

152
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,860
 of counsels and knowledge,

153
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,180
 so that you might know with certainty the words of truth.

154
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,100
 Jesus says it's the truth that's gonna set you free

155
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,460
 and it's gonna break you out of this rut

156
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,600
 that we always get ourself into.

157
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
 Now here's what I wanna do.

158
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,740
 I wanna read to you,

159
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,040
 not just a proverb by itself,

160
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,560
 but every now and then there's groupings.

161
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,720
 And there's a group of proverbs that are together.

162
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,640
 And then what I wanna teach you to do

163
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,680
 is how to read your Bible

164
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,520
 in a way that's gonna make it meaningful to you, okay?

165
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,280
 So the proverb, the little section of proverbs

166
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,480
 that I want you to get with me tonight and learn from,

167
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,120
 what's been really helpful to me,

168
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,100
 is found in Proverbs chapter 24, verses 30 through 34, okay?

169
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,140
 Now just hang with me.

170
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,500
 Here we go, I'm gonna just pray.

171
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,660
 Father, man, if there's truth,

172
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,220
 if you're good and you love us

173
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,440
 and there's something you want us to see,

174
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,900
 would you just show it to us tonight,

175
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,060
 wherever we're at,

176
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,980
 whether we're just trying to figure out

177
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,060
 who you are for the first time

178
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,380
 or whether we've known you for a while

179
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,580
 and wanna learn to love you more

180
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,220
 so we will love that which will lead to life indeed,

181
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,420
 would you just show it to us?

182
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,220
 I thank you that the way you describe yourself,

183
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,980
 if we would listen, is as a loving father

184
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,500
 who has our best interests in mind.

185
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,540
 And so we don't have to figure this thing out.

186
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,100
 You just say, come here, let me,

187
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,900
 are you weary, are you heavy laden, are you burdened?

188
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,700
 Then just come, for my yoke is easy, my burden is light.

189
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,080
 And so Father, some of us are hungry, our soul is starved,

190
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,380
 and we're gonna knock tonight on the door of your grace

191
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,280
 and you tell us, if we knock on that door,

192
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,500
 that you're gonna open it and you're gonna invite us in.

193
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,300
 And we're gonna dine with you and we're gonna feast.

194
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,960
 It's gonna make it better for us.

195
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,140
 Lord, we just acknowledge that we've been lied to a lot.

196
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,580
 We think that you're sometimes oppressive and controlling

197
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,980
 and that all you wanna do is slap our hands

198
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,280
 and we realize, when we look at your word

199
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,740
 and see who you've been through history,

200
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,580
 that we're just victims of a lie.

201
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,860
 And so help us see truth tonight.

202
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,500
 Teach us, make us wise sons and daughters

203
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,220
 who learn from you, amen.

204
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,060
 All right, now check this out.

205
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,000
 This is a little section of Proverbs.

206
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,300
 It's unusual because it's really a story

207
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,700
 and what he's trying to show you in this story

208
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,780
 is some things that if you'll just pay attention to it,

209
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,180
 your loving Father wants you to learn from.

210
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,260
 So I'm gonna read it to you all.

211
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,260
 It says Proverbs 24, 30 through 34.

212
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,660
 It says, "I passed by the field of the sluggard

213
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,780
 "and by the vineyard of a man who lacked sense.

214
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,940
 "And behold, it was completely overgrown with thistles,

215
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,380
 "the sluggard's vineyard and field.

216
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,520
 "Its surface was covered with nettles

217
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,620
 "and its stone walls were broken down.

218
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,520
 "When I saw, when I reflected upon it,

219
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,500
 "I looked, I received instruction.

220
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,980
 "A little sleep, a little slumber,

221
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,000
 "a little folding of the hands to rest

222
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,720
 "and then your poverty will come upon you like a robber

223
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,120
 "and your want like an armed man."

224
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,180
 Okay, now look, you read something like that

225
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,540
 and let's just say for just a second,

226
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,220
 you're gonna go, okay, Lord, teach me something

227
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,700
 and you read that little story and you're like,

228
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,660
 well, what gives?

229
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,500
 Right, that's the thing you want me to be encouraged by?

230
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,580
 How can I learn from that?

231
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,600
 Okay, now here's how.

232
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,100
 Whenever you read your Bible, you wanna just stop, okay,

233
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,620
 and you wanna just start to make some basic observations

234
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,560
 and then from those observations, you wanna go,

235
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,580
 okay, now I've seen these things,

236
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,780
 what am I supposed to learn from things that I've seen

237
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,280
 and how can I apply them to my life?

238
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,200
 It's just a simple thing called observation,

239
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,100
 interpretation, application.

240
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,480
 And so when you read a story like that,

241
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,700
 you gotta go, okay, what's there?

242
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,380
 What's he want me to see, okay?

243
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,920
 And so what he's telling you is that this guy

244
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,660
 is walking through life, okay, and as he walks through life,

245
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,420
 he is observing things in other people.

246
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,400
 Can I just tell you something?

247
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,480
 This is a fact.

248
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,580
 Every single person you meet is either a wonderful example

249
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,460
 or their life serves as a horrible warning.

250
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,500
 They're one of two things.

251
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,700
 In some way, every man is your teacher.

252
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,380
 Everybody you meet is a teacher.

253
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,500
 I sometimes, you know, when I'm around people,

254
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,140
 they go, man, I don't like my coach, I don't like my teacher,

255
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,380
 I don't like my boss, and I go, well, then learn from them

256
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,580
 because you're gonna be a boss one day,

257
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,860
 you're gonna be a dad one day,

258
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,580
 you're gonna be a husband one day,

259
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,560
 you're gonna be a friend, and so if that friend

260
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,300
 is bothering you and badgering you, learn from them.

261
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,240
 Go, I don't want to do that.

262
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,420
 And all he's just saying is this.

263
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,680
 Here's the very first thing I want you to get

264
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,760
 out of what we're doing right now,

265
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,540
 and that is just this little statement,

266
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,700
 and that is that experience, experience is a good teacher,

267
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,420
 but it's a very expensive one.

268
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,020
 Because experience, right, experience is,

269
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,980
 while it teaches you in an amazing way,

270
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,660
 it often gives you the final exam

271
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,780
 before the very first lesson, right?

272
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,880
 I mean, you can learn that mines blow you up

273
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,620
 and cause you to lose your leg by stepping on a mine.

274
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,700
 You've learned that, right?

275
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,140
 As well as anybody who's learned that,

276
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,180
 you know you don't want to step on a landmine.

277
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,060
 But that's a very expensive way to learn

278
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,140
 that you don't go stepping on landmines.

279
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,060
 Some of you have learned a very expensive lesson

280
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,300
 that when a guy says he loves you,

281
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,340
 and if you love him, you'd share yourself with him,

282
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,500
 and then he'll always be there, and you're a single mom.

283
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,000
 You have learned that guys say whatever they need to say

284
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,500
 to get whatever they want sometimes,

285
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,700
 and you know that you can't always trust a man

286
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,140
 in the heat of a moment, and you've learned that,

287
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,060
 and you've learned it in a very expensive way.

288
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,660
 Some of you guys have learned from Planned Parenthood

289
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,500
 that it's not just a small procedure

290
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,300
 with no lasting consequences.

291
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,980
 You know that that's a lie.

292
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,520
 You know that this Mother's Day, when it comes around,

293
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,860
 that there should be a life that should be looking at you

294
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,340
 with loving eyes and be grateful for you, and you won't,

295
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,660
 and it's gonna haunt you on Mother's Day.

296
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,040
 You've learned that it's a lie,

297
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,200
 that it's just a clump of cells,

298
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,620
 it's not a life inside of you,

299
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,920
 and you've learned it in a very expensive way.

300
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,860
 And God just wants you to know

301
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,220
 that there's a better way to go about learning things.

302
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,480
 The trouble with using experience as a guide,

303
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,580
 as again, as I said, is that sometimes you get tested

304
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,220
 before you get instructed.

305
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,300
 But we say this all the time, right?

306
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,220
 Experience is the best teacher.

307
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,580
 Nothing beats experience.

308
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,860
 Yes, something beats experience.

309
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,560
 Do you know what beats experience?

310
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,980
 What beats experience is learning

311
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,480
 from other people's experiences

312
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,280
 so you don't have to step on a landmine.

313
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,080
 Have a child out of wedlock,

314
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,320
 or have a child taken out of your womb,

315
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,400
 and realize that there's more truth than you were told.

316
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,360
 So a wise guy said this a long time ago,

317
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,360
 and that is that wise men learn more from fools

318
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,280
 than fools learn from wise men.

319
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,840
 Because why wise men will learn from the follies of fools,

320
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,240
 fools will learn from the follies of fools

321
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,480
 fools will not learn from the wisdom of the wise.

322
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,360
 Can I say that to you again?

323
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,920
 Wise men learn more from fools than fools do from wise men.

324
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,200
 Doesn't that seem backwards?

325
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,240
 Like if you're a fool, you're like,

326
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,760
 man, let's watch this guy's life.

327
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,520
 And what the truth is, is fools never learn from wise men.

328
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,160
 They only learn when they get beaten to death.

329
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,320
 In fact, this is what it says

330
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,200
 in Proverbs chapter 17, verse 10.

331
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,560
 This is just a wisdom principle that is true.

332
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,480
 And it says this, a rebuke, which is a simple admonishment,

333
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,520
 like, bro, I wouldn't go there, don't do that,

334
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,840
 it's not gonna go well with you.

335
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,440
 A rebuke goes deeper into one who has understanding

336
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,480
 than a hundred blows to a fool.

337
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,520
 'Cause a fool continually thinks like,

338
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,640
 well, that didn't work out that time,

339
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,360
 but I'm gonna kinda, I'll do it again, right?

340
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,700
 It's like, you know, it's like the guy,

341
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,960
 you can tell this joke a thousand ways.

342
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,640
 I was just with a couple of guys that were in special forces.

343
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,800
 They were both in special forces,

344
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,120
 one kind of in the Naval branch, one in the Army branch.

345
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,000
 So maybe it was with a Navy SEAL and with a Ranger.

346
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,040
 And they're always jacking with each other, right?

347
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,040
 And the guy told a story, he just said this, he's like,

348
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,760
 you know, there was a Navy SEAL and a Ranger

349
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,000
 that were together, okay?

350
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,880
 And often you hear this, like, with a Marine and a guy

351
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,080
 who's the infantry, right?

352
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,480
 So however you wanna tell it,

353
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,120
 you can tell it like the normal world and Aggies.

354
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,840
 So just anything like that, right?

355
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,560
 Two different people.

356
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,800
 So let's just tell it that way, right?

357
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,120
 So there's a guy standing there next to his Aggie friend.

358
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,840
 And they're sitting there and there's a guy,

359
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,920
 they're watching TV and there's a guy on a roof, right?

360
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,560
 And he's looking to jump and commit suicide.

361
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,600
 And so the two guys are watching it

362
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,080
 and they're leaning in there, they go, oh my gosh.

363
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,120
 You know, and the one guy leans over,

364
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,080
 he goes, I bet you 20 bucks, the guy jumps.

365
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,800
 And the friend saw, you know, that they were getting

366
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,320
 people all in place to talk to him.

367
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,360
 There's folks on bullhorns, they were trying to get a net

368
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,200
 and the guy looks at him, he assesses it, he goes, no.

369
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,600
 He goes, I'll take that bet, he won't jump.

370
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,200
 And then sure enough, man, the guy jumped

371
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,520
 about three minutes later.

372
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,960
 And so the guy reached his pocket and he slapped down,

373
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,320
 gave the guy 20, put it in his pocket.

374
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,640
 And a few minutes later, he leaned over to his friend,

375
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,380
 he said, listen, I can't lie to you, bro.

376
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,600
 That was a replay of the news that happened at noon, right?

377
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,360
 I knew what happened, I knew the guy jumped, right?

378
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,640
 And so I wanna give you your money back.

379
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,240
 And the guy goes, no, the Aggie says, no, man,

380
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
 I'm not gonna take your money back.

381
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,120
 He goes, I saw the guy jump at noon too,

382
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,320
 I just didn't think he was stupid enough to do it twice.

383
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,880
 (congregation laughing)

384
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,720
 It's funny.

385
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,240
 Explain it to your friend later, all right?

386
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,180
 Your Aggie friend.

387
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:05,320
 But sometimes, that's the way it is with a fool, right?

388
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,280
 That's the way it is with a fool.

389
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,000
 They keep doing things like 100 times,

390
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,880
 and if it doesn't kill them,

391
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,160
 they're gonna just keep going back again,

392
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,000
 and they're gonna think the problem

393
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 is that the world's unjust somehow.

394
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,520
 And so the Bible is just saying,

395
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,720
 man, it's better that you learn a different way.

396
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,800
 Experience is not the best teacher.

397
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:25,680
 Or at the very least, it's a very, very expensive one.

398
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,080
 This is what the Bible says.

399
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,960
 The prudent, this is Proverbs 22, three.

400
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,680
 The prudent sees evil, and he hides himself.

401
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,880
 But the naive, the fool, he goes on,

402
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,200
 and he's punished for it.

403
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,840
 Right, haven't we all seen people that date bad boys

404
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,480
 and it not work out well for 'em?

405
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,360
 Haven't we all seen people who try and get their validation

406
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,800
 by other humans and find their meaning

407
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,000
 in fleeting things in the world,

408
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,840
 and it doesn't work out for 'em?

409
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,960
 Haven't we all seen people that try and deal

410
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,520
 with their sorrows with drinking and with drug use

411
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,080
 or with isolation, and we go,

412
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,520
 it doesn't work out well for 'em?

413
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,400
 And the prudent, they see that, and they go,

414
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,920
 okay, I'm not gonna go that way.

415
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,560
 But the naive, they just go on, right?

416
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,400
 That's part of the deceitfulness of sin

417
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,040
 is that we all think we're gonna be the one

418
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,480
 that can handle it and go this way

419
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,180
 that's not gonna really affect us.

420
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,300
 And so it's just a fact that experience,

421
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,780
 in a sense, is a good teacher,

422
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,700
 but it's a very, very expensive one.

423
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,220
 So a wise man does learn from his mistakes,

424
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,220
 but a wiser man still learns from the mistakes of others.

425
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,420
 What this little section of Scripture is all about

426
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,220
 is like, hey, be that wise man,

427
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,780
 and always be looking, always be observing,

428
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,780
 so that what you're gonna see in this story

429
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,660
 is there's a guy, and he's walking by,

430
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,900
 and he's gonna discern, that's the field of sin.

431
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,420
 He's gonna discern, that's the field of a slugger.

432
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,660
 It's the vineyard of a guy who's got no sense.

433
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,780
 Now watch what happens.

434
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,020
 As he walks by, this is what he's gonna tell you.

435
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,300
 He says, it's a field, and that field,

436
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,980
 which is supposed to be a source of life

437
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,180
 and produce and prosperity, it's overgrown with thistles,

438
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,700
 and it's covered with nettles or with weeds.

439
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,540
 And then it says this, right?

440
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,060
 It says the walls are broken down.

441
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,380
 Now why do you have walls around a vineyard?

442
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,620
 You do it to keep predators out,

443
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,740
 boxes that'll come in and rip off fruit around the tree,

444
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,780
 but what kind of wall is it?

445
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,100
 Do you remember, right?

446
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,940
 What kind of wall is it?

447
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,020
 Look at your Bible if you've got it.

448
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,380
 In Proverbs chapter 24, okay,

449
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,900
 it says right there in verse 31, it's a stone wall.

450
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,660
 Now how long does it take for a stone wall to fall down?

451
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,420
 This isn't a wicked fence that's just leaned up.

452
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,780
 This is a stone wall.

453
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,980
 So this is something that has been neglected

454
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,220
 for a long, long time.

455
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,480
 And so what he's gonna say right here

456
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,220
 is this, he's gonna say, "So when I saw,

457
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,540
 "I reflected upon it, I looked."

458
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,820
 And these words, just talk about,

459
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,240
 "I glanced at it, but then I stopped,

460
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,540
 "and then I just stood there."

461
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,660
 And what he was gonna be was a student

462
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,260
 of somebody else's life and the fruit of it.

463
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,500
 You guys ever done this?

464
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,660
 Are you looking at anybody's life,

465
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,760
 and you're kinda going, "Okay, man,

466
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,860
 "I don't really know what I wanna do,

467
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,420
 "but I don't think I want it to go that way."

468
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,500
 And vice versa, have you gone,

469
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,680
 "Hey, man, look, it looks like there's something there

470
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,740
 "worth following.

471
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,960
 "It looks like there's life indeed there.

472
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,860
 "I might wanna be a student of that."

473
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,940
 But it would be wise, if you see a person's life

474
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,460
 that has thorns and thistles and nestles

475
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,340
 and is not protected from every whim and fancy

476
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,780
 and every enemy that comes marauding along,

477
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,680
 then you might wanna go, "Hmm, I gotta learn from that."

478
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,700
 This is what he says.

479
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,480
 He says, "As I walked," he goes, "I saw this,

480
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,720
 "a little sleep, a little slumber,

481
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,320
 "a little folding of the hands to rest."

482
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,940
 Now, that's backwards, isn't it?

483
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,420
 Right, when you go laying down, you don't go sleeping,

484
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,940
 then you slumber, and then you rest.

485
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,180
 You usually go, "I think I'll just sit down here,

486
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,380
 "I'll fold my hands."

487
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,680
 And then you kinda go, "Oh, yeah,

488
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,580
 "I'll just lean back on the slumber for a little bit,"

489
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,500
 and then you move to a sleep.

490
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,640
 That's the way you would think it would be,

491
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,280
 but that's not what it says in this proverb, right?

492
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,260
 So you wanna observe this.

493
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,780
 What's he saying there?

494
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,380
 When he says, "A little sleep, a little slumber,"

495
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,460
 and then, just a little folding of the hands to rest,

496
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,600
 and you got trouble.

497
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,220
 Well, what kind of trouble?

498
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,160
 It tells you, poverty, and it comes like a robber.

499
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,220
 So what's a robber do?

500
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,560
 You make yourself just a simple observation.

501
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,700
 Well, robbers, when they come,

502
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,620
 they don't usually pick up the phone and go,

503
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,000
 "Hey, I don't know what you're doing tonight.

504
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,840
 "You're going to the porch, go.

505
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,160
 "What time you taking off?"

506
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,400
 Good, and you'll get home around what time?

507
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,020
 Awesome, I'm gonna drop by around 7.45, 8.15,

508
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,140
 clean your house out, take your goods,

509
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,980
 and then be out of there.

510
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,020
 Robbers don't do that.

511
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,360
 They come when they're not expected,

512
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,740
 and you're devastated.

513
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,480
 And how about an armed man?

514
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,840
 How's an armed man come?

515
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,360
 An armed man doesn't negotiate with you, right?

516
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,840
 He'll show up right to your face,

517
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,380
 and you're powerless and defenseless.

518
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,000
 You have no ability to prevent

519
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,920
 what's about to happen from happening.

520
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,680
 And so that life you always wanted, you don't get it.

521
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,420
 Why?

522
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,300
 Because a little sleep, and then a little slumber,

523
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,080
 and a little folding of the hand of the rest,

524
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,260
 and you are completely exposed.

525
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,440
 Proverbs 29.1 says this.

526
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,680
 Proverbs 29.1 says, "He who hardens his neck

527
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,320
 "after much reproof will suddenly be broken beyond remedy."

528
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,320
 Some of you guys have experienced that,

529
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,000
 and some of you are just a little

530
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,080
 folding of the hands away from it.

531
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,940
 I mean, you're on the brink.

532
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,040
 How'd you get there?

533
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,140
 You got there because for a long time,

534
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,020
 you have been naive, you haven't been prudent,

535
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,420
 you haven't been paying attention,

536
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,600
 you have been sowing into your life

537
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,520
 disobedience and flippancy and arrogance.

538
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,220
 And here's the deal, you've been kinda getting away with it.

539
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,580
 And so you think you're gonna keep getting away with it.

540
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,180
 But what happens, I can remember,

541
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,400
 when I was in college, one of my favorite classes

542
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,640
 was Constitutional Law, I was headed to law school,

543
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,960
 and so I took Con Law, and it was a great class

544
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,840
 because unlike most classes, Con Law had no midterms,

545
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,540
 no papers, and no tests.

546
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:26,480
 I loved Con Law in September.

547
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,220
 It was the best class I had all of October.

548
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:36,300
 I didn't have to jack with Con Law a bit in November.

549
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,200
 And I slept through it.

550
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,080
 I put it aside while I did other things

551
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,220
 that were more pressing, but then all of a sudden,

552
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,840
 Thanksgiving was over, and I was two weeks away

553
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,360
 from one exam that was my entire semester.

554
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,960
 And there had been sleep, and there had been slumber,

555
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,640
 and now I couldn't do anything but Con Law.

556
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,120
 If I so much as folded my hands, I was done.

557
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,620
 No law school, no heading that direction.

558
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,380
 You see what happens there?

559
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,740
 A little sleep, a little slumber,

560
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,900
 and you've lost all flexibility, man.

561
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,900
 You're on the brink.

562
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:20,140
 'Cause the smallest variance from perfection

563
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,720
 is gonna cost you significantly.

564
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,520
 And what he's saying is, I don't wanna do that.

565
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,020
 I don't want that to be my story, right?

566
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,940
 And so here's just a simple observation.

567
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,140
 I've already given you one, which is that

568
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,460
 experience as a good teacher, it's often

569
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,300
 a very expensive one.

570
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,100
 Here's just another observation I made

571
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,500
 when I was just looking at this little proverb,

572
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,660
 and it's just simply this, and that is that

573
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,020
 a lot of damage can be done a little at a time.

574
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,340
 A lot of damage can be done just a little bit at a time,

575
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,020
 and then all of a sudden, these little decisions

576
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,420
 all add up, and they reap big discretion.

577
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,160
 Big, excuse me, big destruction, big problems.

578
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,980
 I say to people all the time, when they think

579
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,380
 they've gotten something for nothing,

580
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,780
 I go, you haven't gotten something for nothing,

581
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,980
 you just haven't gotten the bill yet.

582
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,420
 Right, it's like the guy, and a lot of you guys

583
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,500
 have done this, this is again, part of the deceitfulness

584
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,220
 of sin is that sometimes we do things

585
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,720
 and we kinda get away with it,

586
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,980
 and so we become a little more bolder in it,

587
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,420
 and we kinda go, we got away with it?

588
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,580
 And so we do it again, and we got away with it?

589
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,980
 But all of a sudden, we're developing a pattern,

590
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,340
 and that a broken, impoverished life

591
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,100
 is gonna come like a robber when we never expected it.

592
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,620
 A couple of truths, this is Ecclesiastes chapter eight,

593
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,020
 verse 11, this is what the Bible says,

594
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,740
 the Bible just loves you, and so the Bible's

595
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,500
 gonna tell you the truth, and that's this,

596
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,700
 because the sentence against an evil deed

597
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,220
 is not executed quickly, in other words,

598
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,380
 because God doesn't strike you with a lightning bolt

599
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,860
 the first time he cuts, because you don't necessarily

600
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,060
 get pregnant the first time you cross lines,

601
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,020
 you get a little bolder in your sin.

602
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,820
 Because the sentence against an evil deed

603
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,000
 is not executed quickly, therefore, this is what happens,

604
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,540
 the hearts of the sons of men among them

605
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,980
 are given fully to do evil, and so here's the thing,

606
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,820
 I just will tell you this all the time,

607
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,900
 because I love you, I mean, you sow a thought,

608
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,980
 and that little thought will eventually reap an action.

609
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:22,700
 That action that you sow will eventually reap a habit.

610
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:28,020
 That habit that you sow eventually reaps a character,

611
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,220
 and that character that you now have

612
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,960
 will eventually be your destiny.

613
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,980
 This is what is called the law of the harvest,

614
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,400
 and the Bible talks about it in Galatians chapter six,

615
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,860
 this is what it says, do not be deceived.

616
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,600
 God's not mocked, man, a man will sow,

617
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,240
 and he will also reap, and so you wanna be

618
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,720
 really, really careful with what you're doing,

619
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,160
 the law of the harvest, right, we say this,

620
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,480
 I think here a lot, because it's so important,

621
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,960
 because this right now is sowing season in your life,

622
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,920
 and what happens a lot of times in our 20s,

623
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,680
 we think, well, I can plant whatever I want,

624
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,600
 it's not gonna really cause me a lot of problems,

625
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,380
 and we're telling you, no, it is, it is,

626
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,860
 we're telling folks all the time, this is true,

627
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,980
 you're not gonna have married problems,

628
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,880
 you're gonna have single people problems

629
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,080
 that you drag into your future relationship.

630
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,440
 And so you might as well learn right now

631
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,720
 to live in a way that's gonna make

632
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,720
 the relationship you dream about work.

633
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,820
 The law of the harvest is this, you reap what you sow,

634
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,600
 you put a tomato seed in the ground,

635
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,120
 you're gonna get tomatoes, so you reap what you sow.

636
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,160
 Secondly, you reap it later than you sow it,

637
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,200
 you put a tomato seed in the ground,

638
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,240
 you don't get a tomato tomorrow, you don't get it next week.

639
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,740
 But eventually, you're gonna get tomato stalk,

640
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,060
 tomato plant, and then you're not gonna get what?

641
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,140
 When you reap what you sow, you reap it later

642
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,500
 than you sow it, and you reap more than you sow.

643
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,860
 This is the law of the harvest.

644
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,260
 The return in your investment's always there.

645
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,540
 So one tomato seed, does it give you one tomato?

646
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,860
 No, it gives you a tomato plant,

647
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,100
 which gives you multiple tomatoes.

648
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,540
 That's the law of the harvest.

649
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,020
 And so a lot of trouble comes a little at a time.

650
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,640
 Now, the inverse is also true,

651
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,620
 that when you sow things in your life,

652
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,340
 it's gonna produce good things,

653
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,260
 and what this guy is saying is he's walking

654
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,980
 by the field of the slugger,

655
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,140
 and by the vineyard of the man lacking sense,

656
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,220
 and he's going, I'm gonna observe, I'm gonna look,

657
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,300
 I'm gonna reflect, I'm gonna study,

658
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,240
 I'm gonna make a decision.

659
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,020
 I don't want my field to look like that.

660
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,060
 Do you guys do that often?

661
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,060
 So here's what's so amazing, right?

662
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,060
 They don't usually show you the backstory

663
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,140
 in movies and love scenes.

664
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,240
 They don't show you the guilt and the sexual disease.

665
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,820
 They don't show you the unwanted pregnancy.

666
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,660
 They don't show you the tears.

667
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,140
 I mean, go watch "Juno."

668
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,440
 Go watch "Fatal Attraction."

669
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,460
 That's the truth about affairs,

670
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,180
 but those movies, you can make one of those

671
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,980
 and get away with it, but it's just,

672
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,740
 it's like, it's not what really typically sells.

673
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,480
 It's like, man, what happened to that one love scene

674
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,540
 on the elevator that turned into just horror?

675
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,620
 And see, here's the thing.

676
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,780
 God's not mad at you.

677
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,540
 He just wants to rescue you.

678
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,380
 He's kind to you, and so he's saying,

679
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,660
 listen, learn from fools.

680
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,460
 Wise men learn from their mistakes,

681
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,060
 but wiser men still learn from mistakes of others.

682
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,400
 (congregation laughing)

683
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,260
 A lot of damage can be done a little at a time,

684
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,060
 and this is just true.

685
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,200
 You know, until it hurts more to stay the same,

686
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,700
 until it hurts to change, most people never change,

687
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,860
 and so I tell a lot of people this.

688
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,460
 Man, if you like what you got, keep doing what you're doing,

689
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,300
 but I'm just gonna tell you,

690
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,140
 if you keep doing what you're doing,

691
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,380
 you're not gonna like what you got

692
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,480
 because while you're over there working in your field

693
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,940
 and doing the right thing, that slugger is over there

694
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,940
 playing Xbox, watching "Game of Thrones,"

695
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,740
 throwing a kegger, and it's not a problem

696
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,580
 the first day he does it, the second day he does it,

697
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,420
 the third day he does it,

698
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,500
 other than he's developing a pattern,

699
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,820
 an action that's gonna turn into a habit,

700
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,580
 that's gonna turn into a character,

701
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,540
 that's gonna turn into a destiny,

702
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:10,120
 and so you just keep doing what you should do.

703
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,220
 I love the story, like, you know, this is the deal.

704
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,740
 Some people have jumped off like a 100-story building,

705
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,420
 right, and they're mocking people

706
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,980
 that believe in the law of gravity

707
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,820
 because like when you first jump off a 100-story building,

708
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,220
 it's like a major adrenaline rush, it's a lot of fun.

709
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,340
 You're like, wow, this is awesome, who needs elevators?

710
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,140
 This is incredible, I've never felt this free before,

711
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,060
 but sooner or later, the reality of your experience

712
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,420
 is gonna catch up with you,

713
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,520
 and I think sometimes you see people free-falling, man.

714
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,060
 They show you a lot of the free-falling,

715
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,500
 the fun, the joy, the adrenaline rush,

716
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,400
 but it still shows you the splat a lot,

717
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:48,020
 and what you need to do is you need to walk by splats.

718
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,900
 (congregation laughing)

719
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,500
 And go, how'd that guy get here?

720
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,580
 I don't want my life to end up like that.

721
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,300
 Some of you guys are in this room tonight,

722
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,380
 and you're saying, man, how did I get here?

723
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:07,100
 When I was out with my kids when they were younger a lot,

724
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,780
 man, whenever we had a chance to engage people

725
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,900
 that were on the streets, and we just never gave 'em

726
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,180
 something to make ourselves feel good,

727
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,020
 but what we would do is we would engage 'em relationally,

728
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,980
 and I would just sit there and say, man, tell me your name.

729
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,900
 You're a person.

730
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,180
 You got a story.

731
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,180
 I'd introduce myself.

732
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,900
 I'd introduce my child, and I'd say,

733
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,740
 can you do me a favor, man?

734
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,660
 Just tell me how you got here,

735
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,460
 and they said the same thing every time.

736
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,380
 You know what everybody, everybody I've ever sat with

737
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,480
 on the street has told me?

738
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,460
 You know how I got here?

739
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,440
 I got here one bad decision at a time,

740
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,460
 and then another bad decision, and then another bad decision,

741
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,940
 and another bad decision, and here I am.

742
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,360
 (congregation laughing)

743
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,580
 So there's a way out.

744
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,420
 We offer it to 'em.

745
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,780
 We offer to get involved in their life

746
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,700
 and not just give them a little band-aid,

747
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,260
 but to really say, man, if you're sick and tired

748
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,960
 of being sick and tired, let's go.

749
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,180
 Does it hurt more to stay the same than it does to change,

750
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,780
 and sadly, there's so many people in Dallas who mean well,

751
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,780
 that'll offer a handout that really isn't a handout.

752
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,700
 It's holding 'em down because it's enabling them

753
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,500
 in a lifestyle that's not good for them

754
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,020
 that a lot of 'em go, man, this is working for me.

755
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,820
 I'm making 80 bucks a day working two hours

756
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,940
 just hitting the streets.

757
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,820
 That's enough, and we're stringing 'em out,

758
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,700
 but a lot of damage can be done in a little time.

759
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,100
 I learned that from Proverbs 24, 30 through 34.

760
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,520
 Experience is a good teacher.

761
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,780
 It's often a very expensive one.

762
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,780
 I learned that from Proverbs 20, verses 30 through 34

763
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,780
 'cause I could be a sluggard.

764
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,560
 I could let my vineyard be overgrown

765
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,860
 with thistles and thorns.

766
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:36,980
 Here's another one, man.

767
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,840
 Your soul, your soul is like a field.

768
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,480
 I thought, you know, this is not about a vineyard.

769
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,720
 God's trying to teach me something here.

770
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,360
 My soul is a field, and I ought to pay attention to it

771
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,640
 because this is gonna lead, the way I lead my life

772
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,800
 is gonna lead to prosperity.

773
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,920
 It's gonna lead to blessing.

774
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,420
 It's gonna lead to, in a sense, more joy,

775
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,320
 or I'm gonna have myself more pain,

776
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,400
 and so one of my favorite verses, it's just true,

777
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,640
 in Proverbs, it's Proverbs 10, verse 22,

778
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,640
 which says, "It's the blessing of the Lord

779
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:15,080
 "which makes rich, and he adds no sorrow to it."

780
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,760
 I've got one of my kids, who now is your age,

781
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,640
 she's 24 years old, and she just said,

782
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,640
 "Dad, can I just tell you something?

783
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,120
 "Because by the grace of God, you told me

784
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,020
 "what was gonna happen if I lived the life of a sluggard.

785
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,840
 "If you helped me see what was true about God,

786
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,600
 "and I came to know him at an early age."

787
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,020
 She said, "Dad, this is the story of my life.

788
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,560
 "I've got more joy and less scars."

789
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,320
 And that's her testimony.

790
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,480
 I mean, some of you guys in this room,

791
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,120
 that's also your testimony, it's amazing.

792
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,120
 Don't ever think that because you don't have

793
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,600
 some dramatic story, that you didn't show up at the porch,

794
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,640
 smelling like smoke hung over in the back,

795
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,280
 that you can't be used of God,

796
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,360
 because the most powerful testimony that God can give you

797
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,240
 is that early, God showed you his kindness,

798
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,280
 and you've got more joy and less scars.

799
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,600
 Man, that is a testimony, that all your days,

800
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,440
 God has walked with you.

801
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,980
 It's largely David's testimony,

802
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,980
 and he's worth following.

803
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:12,040
 But here's the other thing, if you have got scars,

804
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,760
 if your field is overthrown with thistles,

805
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,680
 if your stone walls are broken down,

806
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,240
 God's just saying, "Hey, you sick and tired

807
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,220
 "of being sick and tired?

808
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,040
 "Then come on, let me rebuild those things."

809
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,600
 There's grace here.

810
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,960
 The only power you have over the past

811
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,400
 is purity in the present.

812
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,360
 And let's get busy.

813
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,360
 But your soul is a field, pay attention to it.

814
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,360
 This is what comes after that verse in Galatians 6,

815
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,200
 we just read.

816
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,960
 This is Galatians 6, eight through nine.

817
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,000
 It says, "For the one who sows to his own flesh,"

818
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,600
 in other words, who does what his flesh wants to do.

819
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,220
 Our flesh is a part of this world,

820
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,980
 and this world is broken.

821
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,840
 The world is broken because this world,

822
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,680
 and everybody in it, and the prince of this world,

823
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,720
 the enemy, is a liar, and we have given ourself over to him,

824
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,840
 and so we are descendants of broken people.

825
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,760
 Therefore, our flesh longs to do what it wants to do,

826
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,120
 and doesn't care what God says and who God is.

827
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,560
 That's the nature of man.

828
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,840
 All of us, in and of our nature,

829
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,980
 go, "I wanna do what I wanna do."

830
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,600
 But God, in his kindness, says,

831
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,160
 "That's not gonna work out well for you,

832
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,360
 "and anybody who doesn't like the family

833
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,200
 "you were born into, I will rescue you."

834
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,060
 Did you hear that?

835
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,960
 Even you people who were born into a family

836
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,720
 where somebody like me is gonna teach you

837
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,320
 that it's the blessing of the Lord that makes rich,

838
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,360
 and he has no sorrow to it, you gotta make a decision,

839
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,560
 because you're still a son of Adam and a daughter of Eve,

840
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,480
 and so your flesh is gonna go,

841
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,840
 "I don't know if I wanna listen to my old man.

842
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,080
 "I don't know if I wanna listen to wisdom.

843
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,960
 "I think I like my own knowledge."

844
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,360
 And there's a way that seems right to you,

845
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,080
 it's gonna lead to death, and you can either learn

846
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,680
 it leads to death through your own choices

847
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,440
 and your own experiences, or you can go and look

848
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,060
 at people who already rebelled against God,

849
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,680
 and walk by their splat, and go,

850
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,860
 "I think I will take the vineyard

851
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,680
 "of the man that was diligent."

852
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:55,840
 And sowed in the spring, and reaped in the harvest,

853
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,760
 and planted the right things,

854
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,120
 and built up walls of protection,

855
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,120
 and followed a wise father who called them to work

856
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,920
 and not be lazy and give themselves over to their flesh.

857
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,920
 See, Proverbs is just a loving father trying to help you,

858
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,240
 and we all need to learn.

859
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,080
 We all need to learn.

860
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,400
 There's a guy named John Wesley who was a great leader

861
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,960
 and a godly man, and he studied, he disciplined himself

862
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,040
 to learn as much as he could,

863
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,480
 and somebody wrote him a letter one time,

864
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,960
 and said, "The Lord told me to tell you

865
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,280
 "that he doesn't need all of your learning."

866
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,920
 And so Wesley got that letter, and he wrote back, okay,

867
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,120
 and he said this.

868
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,980
 He goes, "Thank you, sir.

869
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,960
 "I got your letter, though it was superfluous,"

870
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,480
 meaning it was unnecessary.

871
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,220
 "I know the Lord doesn't need my learning,

872
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,040
 "but I wanna let you know,

873
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,540
 "the Lord has not told me to say this.

874
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,500
 "I say this on my own responsibility.

875
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,840
 "The Lord doesn't need your ignorance either."

876
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,720
 That's a fact.

877
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:55,040
 But you need to learn.

878
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,480
 See, the glory of young men, this is another proverb,

879
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,480
 Proverbs 20, verse 29 says,

880
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,000
 "The glory of young men is their strength."

881
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,440
 And when you're strong, you can kinda jump off

882
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,000
 taller things than you should and kinda bounce back.

883
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,080
 And the glory of young men is their strength.

884
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,400
 The glory of young women is their strength.

885
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,040
 But the glory of old men, it says, is their gray hair,

886
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,720
 which I'm increasingly seeing is mine.

887
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,680
 But it means I haven't ruined my life,

888
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,220
 that I'm around to have hair that turns gray.

889
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,900
 And I've lived a life that has largely been defined

890
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,340
 by wisdom, and underneath that graying hair

891
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,580
 is a life that has more joy and less scars.

892
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,420
 And the Lord is my strength,

893
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,880
 that has kept me from ruining my vineyard.

894
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,260
 And your soul is a field.

895
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:50,120
 And right now, you see, you gotta have the strength

896
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,780
 of early spring, and so you just can be a little lazy

897
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,180
 and it doesn't look like it's a problem,

898
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,500
 but let me just tell you something.

899
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,340
 It's a problem.

900
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:02,060
 Those exercise habits, those eating habits,

901
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,720
 those dating habits, those thinking habits,

902
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,680
 sow a thought, reap an action.

903
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,700
 Sow an action, reap a habit.

904
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,580
 Sow a habit, reap a character.

905
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,060
 Sow a character, reap a destiny.

906
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:19,060
 And you don't want thorns, thistles, and broken walls.

907
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:22,660
 I was speaking at a deal in Laguna Beach,

908
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,360
 which is not a bad place to say yes to speak, last week.

909
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,700
 And I was there, and one of the guys that I was dealing with,

910
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,340
 I'm gonna call him Ken, it wasn't his name,

911
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,800
 but Ken and I got in a conversation.

912
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,540
 He was there, he just got a new job,

913
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,140
 and I just go, man, Ken, tell me what's going on.

914
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,320
 And so he and I were just interacting while I was there.

915
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,420
 He was actually serving me and taking care of me.

916
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,860
 And I said, hey, Ken, let me ask you a question, man.

917
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,340
 So as we talked a little bit more,

918
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,060
 and man, this guy, you could tell, he was just,

919
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,620
 he was flying high, he had made a lot of money

920
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,140
 in the oil fields, and now he was out in California,

921
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,660
 and he was doing well, he was living in Laguna,

922
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,180
 had a new job on the beach, and I go,

923
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,960
 so man, tell me about your belief, what do you believe?

924
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,120
 You have a faith?

925
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,680
 And he said, well, he goes, I'm spiritual.

926
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,920
 I love being in the ocean, man.

927
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,320
 When I'm in the ocean, I'm one with God, right?

928
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,080
 When I'm walking out there in nature, I just feel good.

929
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,440
 My girlfriend and I were in love,

930
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,560
 and I just say, hey, Ken, here's the deal, bro.

931
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,880
 You do know that that's not the way it's always gonna be.

932
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,600
 Sometimes that ocean swells up,

933
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,200
 sometimes there's an undertow that sucks you out,

934
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,980
 sometimes there's sharks in there that eat you,

935
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,600
 sometimes you get old and you can't swim.

936
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,720
 That girlfriend you're sleeping with

937
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,960
 where everything's going well,

938
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,480
 sometimes that doesn't lead, you do know

939
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,720
 that it's not always your first two weeks in California

940
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,840
 where you're spending your money

941
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,800
 sleeping with your girlfriend, hanging out in the ocean.

942
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,480
 You do know things are gonna change.

943
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,440
 What are you gonna do with your spiritual joy then?

944
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,520
 What are you gonna do when some of this behavior

945
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,840
 is no longer bringing the blessing that it is now?

946
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,520
 And he was a really humble guy.

947
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,280
 He didn't say, I'll deal with that when it happens.

948
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,560
 It just made him stop and think,

949
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,360
 and I just said, let me just ask you a question.

950
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,680
 Do you know the God that you say when you're in the ocean,

951
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,520
 you enjoy it, the God that made you made that ocean,

952
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,680
 he wants you to enjoy it.

953
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,840
 You know the God that made that girl,

954
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,480
 he wants you to enjoy her.

955
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,880
 You know the God that made you right now

956
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,280
 at this age and young, he wants you to enjoy it.

957
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,240
 But I'm gonna tell you that right now,

958
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,840
 the way you're running your life

959
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,040
 is not gonna lead to the life that you want.

960
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,480
 And so I'm just gonna ask you to start thinking

961
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,700
 about what you're sowing into your life

962
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,040
 because here's what you need to know.

963
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,960
 Even if it never turns you on in this life,

964
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,960
 it's appointed for men to die once

965
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,160
 and after this comes judgment.

966
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,000
 What's your plan when judgment comes?

967
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,680
 And then I just said, has anybody ever told you

968
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,240
 what the central message of the scripture is?

969
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,440
 Because God's not just here to give you your best life now,

970
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,520
 God is here to rescue you from a life

971
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,420
 that doesn't wanna deal with tomorrow.

972
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:36,040
 He doesn't want stone walls to start to crumble

973
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,760
 and he doesn't want thistles to grow and metals to inhabit.

974
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,960
 He wants blessing for you.

975
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,280
 But to do that, you gotta be connected to him

976
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,640
 and sin keeps you from him.

977
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,920
 And so I just asked him, has anybody ever told you

978
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,120
 what the central message of the Bible is?

979
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,820
 He didn't have any clue.

980
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,400
 Kind of threw out some churchy ideas

981
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,040
 that God wants this, God wants that,

982
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,880
 and I just asked him, I said,

983
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,440
 can I just tell you what God wants?

984
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,600
 And I told him a story.

985
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,760
 That God loves the daughters of Eve and the sons of Adam.

986
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,440
 He's not mad at them.

987
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,600
 And there's a way that seems right to them,

988
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,640
 but it leads to death.

989
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,880
 And it doesn't lead to it right away,

990
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,860
 which is what makes the wrong way seem so deceptive.

991
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,400
 But God wants you to have a way back.

992
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,960
 He wants that relationship with that girl to work.

993
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,000
 He wants that ocean in you,

994
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,160
 not to be something you worship,

995
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,600
 but something that you enjoy.

996
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,820
 Your soul is a field, pay attention to it.

997
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:31,160
 Eventually, gang, who you are in private

998
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,400
 will always show up and affect the way

999
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,800
 that you are seen in public.

1000
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,600
 It always happens that way.

1001
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:45,060
 As I read this, I just learned for myself,

1002
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,920
 not only that experience is a good teacher,

1003
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,440
 that a lot of damage can be done in a little time,

1004
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,880
 that my soul is like a field

1005
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,880
 and I gotta pay attention to it and walk around,

1006
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,520
 and I gotta not sow to my flesh,

1007
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,760
 because when I sow to my flesh, I reap corruption,

1008
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,320
 but the one who sows to the spirit will reap life indeed.

1009
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,840
 I also learned this, that procrastination today

1010
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,640
 will result in unsolicited, unwanted, unexpected,

1011
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,000
 and often unavoidable consequences.

1012
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,640
 That's that little piece I already told you, right?

1013
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,400
 Your poverty will come like a robber

1014
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,680
 and your want like an arm man.

1015
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,640
 Have you ever been there where you're just defenseless

1016
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,360
 against this life and you always do this?

1017
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,520
 You go, how did I get here?

1018
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,560
 How did I get here?

1019
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,400
 And this is it, this is Proverbs chapter 19,

1020
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,480
 verses two and three.

1021
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,760
 It says this, it's not good for a man or a woman

1022
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,080
 to be without knowledge.

1023
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,160
 The foolishness, and it says,

1024
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,040
 he who makes haste with his feet errs, okay?

1025
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,880
 In other words, the one who just hurries his footsteps

1026
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,480
 a certain direction, you're gonna make mistakes.

1027
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,760
 You gotta stop and you gotta think.

1028
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,600
 Listen to what happens though when you make mistakes.

1029
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,960
 Verse three, the foolishness of man subverts

1030
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,920
 or ruins his way, and then what do we all do, right?

1031
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,880
 You ever been here?

1032
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,560
 When you just haven't done what you know you should do,

1033
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,600
 you haven't done what God says is the way to life.

1034
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,160
 God, how could this happen to me?

1035
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,280
 How did I get here?

1036
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,720
 And then we usually start cutting deals with God.

1037
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,400
 God, get me out of this this one time,

1038
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,160
 and I swear I'll never do it again.

1039
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:08,200
 God is gracious, right?

1040
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,560
 God is gracious.

1041
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,960
 He doesn't erase always the consequences,

1042
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,760
 but he lets you stop the life of destruction

1043
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,080
 when you start to look to him.

1044
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,360
 But procrastination is not the path, you know,

1045
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,440
 towards prosperity.

1046
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,000
 Someday, when you say that, someday I'm gonna change.

1047
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,400
 Someday is not a day of the week.

1048
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,360
 It never gets here.

1049
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,920
 Have you noticed that?

1050
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,960
 Can I just tell you something?

1051
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,280
 The devil doesn't care how much you pray.

1052
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,360
 The devil doesn't care how much you study your Bible.

1053
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,960
 The devil doesn't care how much you choose to love God

1054
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,700
 and follow him as long as you don't do it today.

1055
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:45,040
 He loves when you say, I'm gonna get serious

1056
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,880
 with God one day.

1057
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,640
 I'm gonna do my work and really one day

1058
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,000
 figure out if God is good.

1059
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,480
 I'm gonna one day, I'm gonna read my Bible.

1060
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,920
 One day, one day my relationships are gonna be different.

1061
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,640
 One day, I'm not gonna give myself away

1062
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,560
 'cause it seems right to me.

1063
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,700
 He loves when you talk like that.

1064
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,640
 But the truth is that today is the father of tomorrow.

1065
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,720
 Tomorrow is the road to despair.

1066
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,160
 The Bible says today is the day of salvation.

1067
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,120
 When you keep putting it off,

1068
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,880
 I mean, procrastination is the devil's Prozac.

1069
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,560
 It makes you feel better,

1070
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,960
 that eventually you'll feel better.

1071
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:26,640
 But the Scripture just exhorts us to be about it.

1072
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,800
 So many of us say, man, I'd love,

1073
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,320
 I'd give anything to have a life like that.

1074
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,120
 What we mean is I'd love to be able to do whatever I want

1075
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,680
 and wake up tomorrow and my life has a field

1076
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,560
 that's overgrown with prosperity, that's secure,

1077
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,040
 and that is wrapped around strength and dignity

1078
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,840
 as my clothing, nobility and wholeness

1079
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,440
 and purity and strength and kindness.

1080
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,720
 And that's not how you get that life,

1081
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,760
 by just wanting it.

1082
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,840
 I think the last time I was with you guys,

1083
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,400
 I gave you this little syllogism, right?

1084
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,480
 And I think I might've said it wrong,

1085
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,560
 but here's three questions I love to ask people.

1086
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,120
 I'll do it again, let's see if I can get it right this time.

1087
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,720
 And it's that, hey, do you want a life filled with blessing?

1088
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,140
 Do you want a life that would be defined as,

1089
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,040
 that's a godly life, that's a rich life,

1090
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,200
 that's a life that is gonna have prosperity

1091
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,200
 and not just in terms of wealth and health,

1092
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,640
 'cause you may not be wealthy and healthy,

1093
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,000
 you might have cancer and die,

1094
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,480
 but have you ever seen people with cancer

1095
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,760
 that have joy and still sing?

1096
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,520
 You ever seen people that are single,

1097
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,620
 deep into their 40s, that have more security

1098
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,640
 than a woman who's been in and out

1099
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,080
 of relationships continually?

1100
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,920
 Do you want to be a godly man?

1101
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,000
 Do you want to be a godly woman, yes or no?

1102
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,320
 Ask yourself that question.

1103
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,640
 Okay?

1104
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,760
 And now here's the second question.

1105
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,720
 Does God want you to be a godly man or a woman?

1106
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,880
 Does God want you to be a godly man or a woman?

1107
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,960
 And we think, I think so, because God loves me,

1108
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,600
 and when I'm a godly man, it's a life that leads to

1109
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,240
 a blessing, and he has no sorrow to it.

1110
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,040
 Then here's the third question.

1111
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,360
 Are you a godly man, and are you a godly woman?

1112
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,760
 And I'm gonna tell you,

1113
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,120
 if you answer that third question, no,

1114
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,680
 and you answer the first question, yes,

1115
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,800
 you lied to yourself on the very first question.

1116
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,200
 You lied to yourself on the very first question.

1117
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,680
 Because God wants you to be a godly man or a godly woman,

1118
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,280
 and you would be a godly man or a godly woman

1119
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,340
 if you wanted to be.

1120
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,920
 And the reason you're not is because you're hiding

1121
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,560
 behind that lie, that yet tomorrow,

1122
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,880
 I think I'm gonna do the things that will make my life

1123
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,520
 the life that is reconciled with God,

1124
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,960
 forgiven for my sin because of what Jesus has done,

1125
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,400
 and any God that would reconcile to me, to him,

1126
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,200
 and pull me out of judgment and take me out of death

1127
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,320
 and into life is a God worth following and knowing,

1128
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,320
 and now dignity and honor and strength and nobility

1129
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,720
 will be my clothing, and I will not live a life

1130
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,480
 of malice and hatred and hateful envy.

1131
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,080
 I will, by the grace of God, sow into my life

1132
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,200
 the things of the Spirit, and goodness and gentleness

1133
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,200
 and faithfulness and self-control will be the fruit of that.

1134
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,520
 Do you wanna be a godly man or woman?

1135
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,660
 Because you can be.

1136
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,420
 This is Proverbs 13, four.

1137
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,440
 The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing.

1138
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,800
 See, the sluggard doesn't want a field

1139
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,360
 that has walls that are broken down

1140
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,320
 and thistles that cover it and nestles that are everywhere.

1141
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,200
 The sluggard wants to eat.

1142
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,840
 The sluggard wants a good life,

1143
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,720
 but he doesn't do what he needs to do to get it.

1144
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,240
 He doesn't walk with God and follow the law of the harvest.

1145
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,560
 But the soul of the diligent,

1146
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,040
 that's the soul that is made fat.

1147
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,760
 And Jesus says, "Come, come.

1148
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,640
 "Are you hungry?

1149
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,320
 "If anyone hears my voice,

1150
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,080
 (knocking)

1151
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,680
 "knocks on the door, I will open the door

1152
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,280
 "and he will come in with me and dine with me."

1153
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,480
 But you gotta knock, you gotta say,

1154
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,360
 "Hey, I'm sick of living outside the counsel of God.

1155
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,140
 "I'm sick of living apart from you, God,

1156
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:47,120
 "the one who cares for me and blesses me."

1157
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:52,840
 So here's what you need to do.

1158
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,660
 We're just gonna end with this.

1159
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,500
 Here's a statement.

1160
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,320
 I want you to take it just a second.

1161
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,480
 This is what you do when you read your Bible.

1162
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,760
 I just made some observations.

1163
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,740
 You can do that.

1164
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,240
 Stop and go, "What's that there for?

1165
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,080
 "What can I learn?

1166
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,360
 "I can learn that I can learn from other people.

1167
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,680
 "I don't want that life.

1168
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,020
 "I see that his life got that way a little at a time.

1169
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:07,860
 "You know what?

1170
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,800
 "My soul is a lot like that guy's vineyard.

1171
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,760
 "Experience, I could learn that that's a bad life

1172
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,320
 "by doing it myself or I could learn from his life."

1173
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,120
 And so here's what I want you to do

1174
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,240
 before you shut your Bible tonight.

1175
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,460
 I just want you to answer this question.

1176
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,680
 To avoid potential ruin,

1177
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,600
 well, maybe further ruin,

1178
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,440
 to avoid potential or further ruin in my vineyard,

1179
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,720
 the vineyard that is my life,

1180
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,800
 today,

1181
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,600
 I will.

1182
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,360
 Today, I will.

1183
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,680
 And plug it in, today.

1184
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,240
 Not tomorrow, not next week.

1185
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,960
 Not next week where I go up front and say,

1186
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,800
 "Man, would you help me?

1187
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,000
 "Would you stop me to put this life together?

1188
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,960
 "Because I think I've made one decision, another decision,

1189
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,360
 "and I'm not far from poverty and soul despair

1190
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,060
 "and anxiety ruling my life like a robber.

1191
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,320
 "I don't even know how I got here.

1192
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,180
 "And I'm angry at God,

1193
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,000
 "but I find out that maybe it's not God's fault.

1194
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,080
 "Maybe it's because I just lived the life of a sluggard

1195
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,160
 "and did what I wanted to do

1196
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,220
 "instead of living a diligent life of discipline.

1197
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,840
 "And I don't want that to be my destiny."

1198
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,440
 And you're gonna find a lot of grace here, man,

1199
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,920
 because a lot of us, we didn't grow up,

1200
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,880
 a lot of us didn't grow up in homes

1201
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,720
 with dads who taught us about the goodness of God.

1202
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,840
 And we had to be reparented, and we had to be rescued.

1203
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,480
 Somebody had to show me who God was,

1204
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,160
 and I had to see the wonders of grace,

1205
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,580
 and I had to move towards him and be rescued.

1206
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,840
 And so I'm just one beggar telling another beggar

1207
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,080
 where to find bread, and I'm saying, "Let's go."

1208
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,800
 The only power we have over our past

1209
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,720
 is purity in the presence.

1210
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,240
 There's a cross that will deliver us from judgment,

1211
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,320
 and then there's a king that will lead us in the way.

1212
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,680
 And I say to you, "Come."

1213
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:45,240
 In order to prevent or avoid potential or further ruin

1214
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,320
 in the vineyard that is my life, today I will.

1215
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,240
 I will at least go,

1216
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,560
 "Hey, what's the central message of the Bible?

1217
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,540
 "Who is Jesus?

1218
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,520
 "What's the big deal about the resurrection?

1219
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,260
 "What's this thing called community?

1220
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,840
 "How do I study my Bible?

1221
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,700
 "Is there a place I can learn to read it,

1222
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,800
 "taught, and do what you did

1223
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,660
 "in this little 30, 45 minutes we had together tonight?

1224
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,340
 "I wanna learn to feed myself.

1225
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,280
 "Can I do that?"

1226
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,580
 Today I will.

1227
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,700
 Step number one is just say,

1228
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,560
 "God, I've avoided you

1229
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,560
 "because I've made you to be something you're apparently not.

1230
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,420
 "You're a loving father.

1231
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,440
 "I didn't have a loving father.

1232
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,400
 "I put on you the attributes that I saw in my dad.

1233
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,420
 "I don't want the life that my dad created for me,

1234
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,440
 "for my kids.

1235
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,040
 "So can you make me a man?

1236
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,260
 "Can you make me a woman?

1237
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,540
 "Can you teach me how to have relationships

1238
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,460
 "that work?"

1239
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:36,400
 Today's the day.

1240
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,860
 God loves you.

1241
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,400
 That's why I love being with you,

1242
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,500
 because I love when 20-year-olds run with Jesus,

1243
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,820
 because you're gonna get to enjoy God for decades

1244
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,960
 and be a source of grace to others.

1245
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,700
 God is a young man's God.

1246
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,560
 Psalm 23, one of our favorite psalms,

1247
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,660
 "The Lord is my shepherd."

1248
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:00,840
 When do we read that to most people?

1249
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,120
 When does Psalm 23 get pulled out most of the time?

1250
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,020
 What's the answer?

1251
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,680
 Funerals, right?

1252
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,840
 The Lord is my shepherd.

1253
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,160
 I shall not want.

1254
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,320
 Eventually, even though he leads me

1255
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,940
 through the valley of the shadow of death,

1256
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,800
 I fear no evil.

1257
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,640
 Let me just tell you something.

1258
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,800
 David did not write that song on his deathbed.

1259
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,080
 David wrote that song when he was younger than you,

1260
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,280
 fighting the terrors of youth.

1261
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,360
 David wrote that psalm when he was in his late teens,

1262
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,700
 early 20s, before he was a king,

1263
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,980
 while he was still out in the fields just working,

1264
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:35,140
 being left when the prophet came to anoint the new king.

1265
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,940
 His dad didn't even think enough about him to come,

1266
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,140
 and David said, "I don't care.

1267
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,900
 "I'm where I'm supposed to be doing

1268
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,700
 "what I'm supposed to be doing, and my God loves me,

1269
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,480
 "and he will lead me to pleasant places,

1270
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,640
 "and he will fill my cup, and I will not forsake him."

1271
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,140
 Psalm 23 is a young person's psalm,

1272
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:54,340
 and this is a young person's God.

1273
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,120
 Enjoy him now.

1274
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,040
 I promise you, there's nothing on lower Greenville

1275
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,800
 that can offer you what God offers you,

1276
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,460
 starting with grace and forgiveness and redemption.

1277
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:10,440
 I, when I was your age, met Jesus,

1278
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,840
 and I am 30 years ahead of you, and I'm just telling you,

1279
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,040
 it's the blessing of the Lord that makes rich,

1280
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,320
 and he adds no sorrow to it.

1281
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,980
 I delight myself in the wife of my youth.

1282
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:23,120
 My kids and I have a great relationship.

1283
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,960
 My community largely thinks I'm a blessing,

1284
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,460
 and I'm just telling you guys,

1285
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,100
 I've gone through cancer, I've gone through despair,

1286
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,400
 I've gone through dysfunctional family relationships

1287
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,300
 with God, and he is good.

1288
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:46,780
 The wisest men that ever lived

1289
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:51,020
 wrapped up the one who wrote Proverbs,

1290
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,680
 didn't live with understanding,

1291
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,880
 lacked wisdom, and paid a deep price.

1292
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,580
 Solomon became this fool.

1293
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:04,620
 And the last stroke of his pen was not Psalm 23,

1294
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,160
 it was Ecclesiastes chapter 12,

1295
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,460
 and this is what he says, verse one.

1296
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:11,140
 "Remember your creator in the days of your youth.

1297
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,660
 "Don't be a fool like me.

1298
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,400
 "Don't be the sluggard,

1299
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,080
 "and don't let your vineyard be overgrown with thistles

1300
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,540
 "and the stone wall of God's word be broken down.

1301
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,080
 "Before the evil years come and the days draw near

1302
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,480
 "when you say I have no delight in them,

1303
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,780
 "because in verses two through 12,

1304
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,280
 "he describes aging and graying hair

1305
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,460
 "and teeth that fall out and ears that can't see

1306
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,080
 "and eyes that grow dim and backs that are crooked

1307
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:39,020
 "and feet that are weak and feeble

1308
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,460
 "and legs that can't jump."

1309
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:43,460
 No, you learn to love God when you're young

1310
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,060
 and you can run with him and enjoy him in that ocean

1311
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,340
 and with the wife of your youth

1312
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,140
 so that you have decades together

1313
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,580
 of blessing and prosperity.

1314
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:54,840
 Verse 13, "The conclusion when all has been heard

1315
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,100
 "is fear God," which means just know

1316
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,280
 you don't wanna miss a single part of his goodness to you.

1317
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,680
 "Keep his commandments," because this applies to every person

1318
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,280
 "for God will bring every act of judgment,

1319
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,140
 "everything which is hidden, whether it's good or evil."

1320
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,160
 The life which you're living in private right now

1321
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,620
 is going to be very quickly dragged

1322
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,120
 into public relationships

1323
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,780
 that you're gonna live for decades to come,

1324
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,720
 and God loves you.

1325
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,700
 And so walk with me by the field of the sluggard.

1326
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:18,860
 And by the vineyard of those

1327
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,320
 that aren't tending to their soul.

1328
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,760
 Maybe it's yours.

1329
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,160
 And so today's the day of salvation.

1330
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,700
 Come home to your king.

1331
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,860
 Let him pull the weeds of sin

1332
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:33,640
 and let him sow the spirit

1333
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,400
 of fruit of righteousness in your life.

1334
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,880
 Father, I pray for my friends

1335
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,620
 that they would just learn to love the wisdom

1336
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,980
 and the truth that's in your word,

1337
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,180
 the way your grace let me,

1338
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,660
 so that they can begin to walk with you, first of all,

1339
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,860
 that they can begin to throw themselves at you

1340
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:54,460
 in their despair and their sin and their sowing rebellion,

1341
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,600
 just like I did,

1342
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,160
 and they can find forgiveness at the cross,

1343
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,700
 just like I did.

1344
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,840
 And when seeing that you're a God

1345
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,100
 that demonstrates his love for us,

1346
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,500
 and while we're still sinners,

1347
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,900
 that they could then go,

1348
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,680
 "What kind of God is this that he would love me

1349
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,880
 "and give his life for me?"

1350
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,780
 That they would then begin to want to run with you

1351
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,040
 and run to you and be around your people

1352
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,920
 that will encourage them day after day

1353
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,220
 so their life is not hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

1354
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,460
 Lord, I pray that tonight in this room,

1355
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:22,360
 and all across the internet that's listening,

1356
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,060
 there will be people that just go, "Lord, thank you.

1357
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,860
 "I'm gonna be one of the wise that learns from fools,

1358
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,300
 "maybe the fools of my own life,

1359
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,460
 "and my heart's not gonna rage against you.

1360
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,780
 "My heart, in its brokenness,

1361
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,600
 "is gonna run to you and find forgiveness."

1362
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,280
 And maybe for the folks that already know you,

1363
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,540
 they're gonna run that much more.

1364
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,680
 And they're gonna say, "Father, thank you

1365
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,520
 "that your desire for me to be a godly son of Adam

1366
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,580
 "or a godly daughter of Eve

1367
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,480
 "is always gonna be greater than my own desire.

1368
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,860
 "So, Lord, draw me to you.

1369
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,420
 "Don't let me miss who you are.

1370
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:49,720
 "Let me trust in you.

1371
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:54,460
 "Let me know the blessing of your way

1372
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:58,060
 "and take away the sorrow of my sluggard, rebellious soul.

1373
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:01,420
 "Be gracious to my friends.

1374
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,660
 "Show them who you are, Father.

1375
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,740
 "In Jesus' name, amen."

1376
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:16,740
