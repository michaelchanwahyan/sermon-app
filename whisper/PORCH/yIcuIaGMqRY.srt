1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,200
 - Welcome, Dallas.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,540
 Welcome, Fort Worth.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,400
 Those tuning in around the country, welcome.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,400
 Welcome, Houston.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,940
 It's great to be with you.

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,380
 It's great to worship with you.

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,160
 It's great to reflect on the goodness of God with you.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,440
 The last couple weeks, I started talking about

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,840
 moving into a house, and the reason I have,

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,880
 this is just kind of a big event in our lives,

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,920
 we're actually building a house.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,960
 And so we've never done this before.

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,220
 We're new to this game, and so this happened

15
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,800
 because we had sold a house that we had lived in

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,400
 for a little while and made a profit

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,880
 that we wanted to reinvest.

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,420
 And then we have some friends, some really good friends

19
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,600
 who are also builders, which afforded us

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,920
 the opportunity to build a home.

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
 And so we were excited about that.

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,440
 And everybody has kind of set us up

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,960
 for how awful that can be.

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,820
 And so they have just said, hey, make sure your marriage

25
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,660
 is in a good place.

26
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,000
 I'm like, serious?

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
 Make sure my, okay, it is.

28
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,600
 And so we've kind of started going down this path,

29
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,440
 and it's been awesome.

30
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,400
 Everything has gone unbelievably smooth,

31
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,560
 except one thing.

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,240
 There's kind of been one hiccup along the way

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,480
 as I reflect on this process,

34
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,600
 and really that kind of designing process,

35
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,800
 what's gonna go where.

36
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,320
 And it's not, you know, listen,

37
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,200
 it's not gonna be on MTV Cribs or anything,

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,360
 or like, you know, parsonage pimped out

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,200
 or anything like that.

40
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,640
 It's just a house.

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,080
 But the one thing that's kind of been the hiccup

42
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,400
 is the lights, where the lights go.

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,220
 And here's why.

44
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,100
 Because they're expensive, okay?

45
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,620
 You have to pay for both the wiring,

46
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,300
 so the electrical work, and then as well,

47
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,900
 the fixtures, the light fixtures themselves

48
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,680
 are very expensive.

49
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,180
 And so here's what I'm trying to do

50
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,800
 is I'm trying to figure out how we go without.

51
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,240
 I'm like one of the builders, and I'm like,

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,760
 do we really need lights?

53
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,560
 I mean, and so everything, I'm serious,

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,680
 this is a real conversation.

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,120
 We're looking, and there's like a stairwell,

56
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,840
 and I'm like, I think we can put one light there.

57
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,480
 And he's like, no, you're gonna need at least three.

58
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,520
 And I'm like, no, just put a bright one, okay?

59
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,520
 And he's like, bro, your kids are gonna fall down the stairs.

60
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,880
 Like, you need a light.

61
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,840
 And I'm like, okay, fine.

62
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,160
 And he's like, in this bathroom,

63
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,240
 like, we'll put a light here.

64
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,260
 And he's like, you're gonna need two.

65
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,620
 I'm like, listen, we can go potty in the dark, okay?

66
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,340
 I've done it 1,000 times.

67
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,700
 It can be done, just put one light there.

68
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,980
 And so we're kind of going back and forth on this.

69
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,060
 And so I show you just kind of the light plans.

70
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,580
 I think we have a picture, so there it is again.

71
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,420
 And so those little circles, those are the lights,

72
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,700
 and then the dotted lines, this is the electrical plans.

73
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,740
 The dotted lines are the wires and whatnot.

74
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,100
 And this is an intense process.

75
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,000
 You literally sit down and choose

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,940
 where every single light's gonna go,

77
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,420
 and with every light, I just see dollar signs

78
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,100
 flying out the window.

79
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,100
 And so we kind of do it, the lights are up,

80
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,600
 and I'm walking the house now, and it's painted,

81
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,500
 and the lights are there, and I'm with the builder.

82
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,460
 And over the island, if you will, in the kitchen,

83
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,780
 there's two pendant lights.

84
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,060
 Those are these kind of things that hang down.

85
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,100
 And I'm looking at it, and I'm like,

86
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,780
 hey, you know, everything looks good.

87
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,580
 And the builder's just kind of like looking,

88
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,440
 and kind of walking around and looking.

89
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,980
 And he's like, those are off.

90
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,860
 And I'm like, what do you mean?

91
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,740
 And he's like, well, they're four inches that way.

92
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,820
 They need to be centered, they're four inches off.

93
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,900
 And so everything, it's like painted, okay,

94
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,500
 like the sheet rock's there.

95
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,980
 And I'm like, oh, bro, don't worry about it.

96
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,980
 No need to move 'em.

97
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,580
 He's like, no, man, you gotta put 'em in the right place.

98
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,140
 This is a masterful builder who takes pride in his work,

99
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,880
 and he's like, you've gotta put the light in the right place.

100
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,700
 If you put it where it is, you're not gonna be able

101
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,880
 to see what you're eating.

102
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,140
 It needs to be four inches this way.

103
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,900
 And so they go and they rewire and tear out the sheet rock

104
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,860
 and move the pendants four inches toward the island,

105
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,500
 or at least they're going to.

106
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,480
 Because he takes pride in his work,

107
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,480
 and he's very, very intentional of where he puts lights.

108
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,580
 God's building something.

109
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,180
 He's building a kingdom of which Jesus is going to come back

110
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,980
 and finish the job.

111
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,660
 But we start the job.

112
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,360
 As followers of Jesus Christ, if you're here,

113
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,840
 and the Holy Spirit indwells you,

114
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,040
 meaning influences you towards the things of God,

115
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,280
 he's building something, and the metaphor

116
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,400
 that Jesus uses for you is a light.

117
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,680
 He says, let your light shine before men

118
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,920
 so that they will glorify your Father in heaven.

119
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,800
 And God is hanging lights throughout this world.

120
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,500
 He has his people throughout this world,

121
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,900
 and we are reflecting the goodness of God

122
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,820
 and the reality of God through the sharing of the gospel

123
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,860
 and the building of his kingdom.

124
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,380
 There are dead people walking around us,

125
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,380
 eternal beings destined for one of two destinations,

126
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,500
 be it hell or be it heaven.

127
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,180
 And God uses a story, his spirit,

128
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,980
 breathed in through a narrative which you share,

129
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,320
 which might determine which is which.

130
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,980
 This is your purpose.

131
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,580
 This is why you have breath in your lungs.

132
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,140
 This is why your heart beats in your chest.

133
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,820
 This is why the Lord left you here after he saved you,

134
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,100
 so that you would carry forth this life-saving,

135
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,200
 eternal-changing, eternity-changing narrative,

136
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,980
 that you would share it.

137
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,820
 And this is your purpose, and I'm telling you,

138
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,420
 and I've said it before, a person who lives

139
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,460
 outside their purpose is a great tragedy.

140
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,580
 It is tragic when you live outside your purpose.

141
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,620
 In fact, you won't experience life in that realm.

142
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,060
 You won't really understand while you're here.

143
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,820
 You'll look for purpose in work

144
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,460
 and in all of these other things, and you will miss it,

145
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,700
 because God has given you an eternal purpose,

146
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,820
 a purpose that extends past your hobbies,

147
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,900
 extends past your likes, extends past your job

148
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,540
 or your occupation or your talents or your gifts,

149
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,700
 something much, much bigger than you.

150
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:37,420
 I've heard it said that you are a missionary

151
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,660
 or a mission field.

152
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,840
 Spurgeon said every Christian is a missionary or an imposter.

153
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,340
 I'm telling you that you are a missionary or you need one.

154
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:56,740
 The very essence of Christianity is sharing Christ

155
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,260
 with those who do not know him, and so tonight,

156
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,580
 we're talking about the reality that you are the light,

157
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,300
 that God left here, that you carry forth the gospel,

158
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,060
 that you show the world the love of Jesus,

159
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,020
 and so I'll share with you some statistics.

160
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,420
 Lifeway Research Group did this survey in 2013,

161
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,900
 and they said 80% of Christians

162
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,260
 believe they have a personal responsibility

163
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,340
 to share their faith.

164
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,780
 80% of Christians believe they have a personal responsibility

165
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,620
 to share their faith.

166
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,400
 When I heard that statistic,

167
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,100
 I thought 20% of Christians aren't Christians,

168
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,860
 'cause how can you be a Christian and not believe

169
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,660
 that you have a responsibility to share your faith?

170
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,000
 And while 80% believe that they do,

171
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,820
 it says that only 39% of Christians

172
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,660
 have shared with at least one person in the past six months,

173
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:52,420
 which means to me 61% of Christians aren't being Christian.

174
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,300
 They're not being very Christian,

175
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,500
 and so we're starting a new series tonight.

176
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,500
 This series comes from Romans 1, verse 16, unashamed,

177
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,360
 or we're calling it unashamed.

178
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,640
 You're gonna hear more about the origination of this series,

179
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,060
 where it came from, some tonight,

180
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,900
 some in the weeks ahead.

181
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,780
 We'll be here three weeks, but it's actually based on,

182
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,820
 and not to be confusing, 'cause I just said Romans 1:16,

183
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,940
 it's actually based on Acts 1:8.

184
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,040
 Acts 1:8 is the Great Commission in the Acts accounts, okay?

185
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,540
 And so as the apostles lived it,

186
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,580
 the Great Commission is right before Jesus goes up

187
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,540
 to be with God at the right hand of God in heaven,

188
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,420
 before he ascends, he tells his followers,

189
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,060
 hey, you're to go into all the earth

190
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,460
 and teach them the very things that I taught you,

191
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,100
 baptizing them in the name of the Father,

192
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,240
 and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

193
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,140
 If you are here and you're going to be with God

194
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,340
 forever in heaven, it is because of the faithful work

195
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,860
 of those men living out that mission,

196
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,580
 being unashamed of the gospel.

197
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,860
 Acts 1:8, now the account in Acts, reads like this.

198
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,940
 They come to him, they say, Jesus,

199
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,780
 are you going to restore the kingdom?

200
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,340
 Right now is now the time you're going to restore the kingdom

201
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,260
 and he says, no, I'm gonna go away.

202
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,640
 But one's going to come to you, he says this,

203
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,640
 but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you

204
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,900
 and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem,

205
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,180
 and in Judea, and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

206
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,380
 And so as we do this series, the first week,

207
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,780
 we're gonna talk about our Jerusalem,

208
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,060
 the places that we are.

209
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,500
 This is where the apostles were, their Jerusalem.

210
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,020
 Judea and Samaria was the area that was entrusted to them,

211
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,480
 and then all the ends of the earth

212
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,460
 is how the Gentiles essentially heard the gospel,

213
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,620
 that's you and I, because they lived out this mission.

214
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,640
 They had passed the torch to you.

215
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,860
 They carried it with their life.

216
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,760
 It cost them their life, by the way.

217
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,740
 And they've carried it forward and it's now reached you.

218
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,380
 What are you going to do with it?

219
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:02,080
 Have a big party and go home, make a million dollars,

220
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,820
 you know, live quietly in the neighborhood.

221
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,540
 What are you going to do with this torch

222
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,380
 that people have entrusted to you, cost them their lives?

223
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,620
 These were young adults, essentially nobodies,

224
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,780
 people, the ones that rabbis had forgotten.

225
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,900
 They didn't have a lot of money.

226
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,740
 They were 20s and 30-somethings.

227
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,200
 And when they understood who Jesus was,

228
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,140
 they said, man, I will give my life to that.

229
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,060
 Church isn't something that I'm just gonna go to.

230
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,560
 Church is something I am.

231
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:35,800
 Before I'm anything, I'm a follower of Jesus Christ.

232
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,660
 This is my prayer for us this evening.

233
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,820
 And so in this series, we will cover your Jerusalem

234
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,300
 tonight, your Judea and Samaria next week,

235
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,980
 and then the ends of the earth.

236
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,700
 Tonight, specifically, we're going to talk

237
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,140
 about your purpose, the place of which

238
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,500
 you will live out that purpose,

239
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,100
 and the people and the place of which

240
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,780
 you will live out that purpose.

241
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,380
 So your purpose, your place, and your people.

242
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,860
 I'm gonna be in Acts, I mean, sorry,

243
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,260
 Matthew 5, if you want to turn there.

244
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,340
 This is the Sermon on the Mount.

245
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,700
 Matthew, first book of the New Testament,

246
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,260
 chapter five, verse 13.

247
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,660
 Jesus is teaching, this is a sermon.

248
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,300
 Jesus gave this sermon, okay, the most famous sermon

249
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,940
 in the history of history, the Sermon on the Mount.

250
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,780
 This is an excerpt from the Sermon on the Mount,

251
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,300
 of which, if you were there, I don't think

252
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,820
 you'd go home and be like, oh my goodness,

253
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,420
 I just heard this amazing speaker today.

254
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,220
 He called me salt and light, it was amazing.

255
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,700
 No, I think you'd be like, what?

256
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,540
 What does that even mean?

257
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,100
 And so tonight, we're gonna talk about what it means.

258
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,140
 He says, verse 13.

259
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,860
 You are the salt of the earth,

260
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,580
 but if the salt loses its saltiness,

261
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,500
 how can it be made salty again?

262
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,740
 It is no longer good for anything,

263
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,220
 except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.

264
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,260
 There's a lot going on here.

265
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,420
 You're like, okay, Jesus just called me

266
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,700
 that little canister by the pepper, that's weird, Jesus.

267
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,420
 What are you saying there?

268
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,380
 And so salt in this community, it was very valuable.

269
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,860
 First of all, soldiers were paid in salt.

270
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,100
 If you've ever heard a man's not worth his salt,

271
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,740
 or is he worth his salt, that comes from this reality

272
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,740
 that the Roman soldiers were paid in salt.

273
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,620
 We get the word salary from the word salt.

274
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,540
 Okay, interesting.

275
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,500
 And so what they would do is salt there was not mined,

276
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,180
 it came from the ocean.

277
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,300
 So they would go in the ocean,

278
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,340
 this is the area, think of the Dead Sea,

279
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,460
 where it's salt, very salty water.

280
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,300
 They would go and get plants from the ocean,

281
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,700
 and they would rub it on their meat.

282
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,900
 And what it would do is it would preserve the meat.

283
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,340
 It would keep the meat from rotting.

284
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,580
 And then when they were done rubbing it on the meat,

285
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,460
 if it wasn't salty anymore,

286
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,140
 they would then throw it on their flat thatched roof.

287
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,540
 And what it would do is as people would walk

288
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,860
 on top of the roofs, it would trample the things

289
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,980
 that were salty so that it would seal their roof.

290
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,180
 And so this is the metaphor,

291
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,220
 the imagery that Jesus is giving it.

292
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,020
 He's saying, hey, the purpose of salt

293
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,020
 is to preserve things from rotting.

294
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,220
 But after you have used it, after it has served its purpose,

295
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,140
 it goes on its roof, on the roof, and it is purposeless.

296
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,260
 In fact, the very word for good here

297
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,620
 is the same word that we see in Acts 1:8 for power.

298
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,860
 It says, it is no longer good for anything.

299
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,620
 And it's the same word we see in Acts 1:8

300
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,100
 where it says you will receive power.

301
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,580
 You will receive purpose.

302
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:38,780
 Here in Matthew 5, it is no longer purposeful for anything.

303
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,860
 It has lost its purpose.

304
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,740
 So what is your purpose?

305
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,420
 Your purpose is to remain salty.

306
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,660
 And what does that mean in context?

307
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,180
 To preserve, to preserve what?

308
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,020
 To preserve the reality and the things of God

309
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,220
 in a culture that is quickly losing them.

310
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,220
 My first point this evening is you have a purpose.

311
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,460
 You have a purpose.

312
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,460
 You must understand what your purpose is.

313
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,180
 I know you think that your purpose

314
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,020
 is to make a lot of money.

315
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,980
 I know you think your purpose is to have a lot of friends

316
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,220
 or a lot of Facebook likes

317
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,940
 or a really good Instagram account

318
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,140
 or whatever you might think your purpose is,

319
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,460
 to have a BMW or something.

320
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,460
 I don't know, but your purpose has been given to you

321
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,980
 by God for God.

322
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,900
 You can't miss that.

323
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:29,100
 God the creator gave you a purpose.

324
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
 That purpose is for him.

325
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,900
 And so there's two metaphors that Jesus uses here.

326
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,780
 The first one is salt,

327
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,540
 and then the next one we'll talk about is actually light.

328
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,540
 And so we are preserving a culture in America.

329
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,900
 Do you know, and I just want you to think about this.

330
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,620
 You probably, you might even disagree right now.

331
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,020
 Go home and think about it.

332
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:53,420
 What people like about America is not America.

333
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,860
 It's not an American culture.

334
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,180
 It's a Christian culture.

335
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,660
 It's a godly culture.

336
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,140
 It's the things of God

337
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,020
 that have been preserved in our culture.

338
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,980
 And you're like, well, wait a minute, hold on.

339
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,820
 What did you say?

340
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,740
 There have been places

341
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,620
 where there has been a Christian culture.

342
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,100
 It has now left.

343
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,680
 Like if you go to parts of Europe right now,

344
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,900
 churches are like museums.

345
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,820
 They're like ruins.

346
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,500
 You would go there, but not to worship.

347
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,060
 You would go there to see the architecture.

348
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,020
 You would go there to see the statues.

349
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,820
 You might go there to see a painting,

350
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,100
 but you're not there to worship.

351
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,100
 In fact, no one really goes there to worship

352
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,160
 because it has moved on.

353
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,220
 The spirit of God has moved on.

354
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,060
 It's headed west.

355
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,420
 It came here to America.

356
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,960
 And it's probably leaving,

357
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,660
 unless you do something about it,

358
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,860
 unless you begin to preserve this culture

359
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,340
 that has been entrusted to us.

360
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,260
 If you look at Amsterdam today,

361
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,180
 that's probably the future of America.

362
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,260
 Things of the red light district,

363
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,120
 the freedom and tolerance and all of those things

364
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,820
 that generation Y and millennials,

365
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,380
 that you and your peers celebrate,

366
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,740
 but don't fully understand.

367
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,300
 You look at Syria,

368
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,380
 where people are losing their head

369
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,080
 because they're a Christian.

370
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,640
 That's the future of Amsterdam.

371
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,020
 This is what happens when a place is Christian,

372
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,540
 when they understand what they believe

373
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,420
 and why they live,

374
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,820
 and they're preserving that culture,

375
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,220
 and then it leaves and it moves on.

376
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,520
 Darkness is left.

377
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,060
 The world that your children will be raised in

378
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,260
 will be very different from the world

379
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,820
 that you were raised in,

380
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,020
 unless you get this.

381
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,380
 As millennials, I've told you before,

382
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,300
 we're poised well for a great awakening,

383
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,100
 a revival, that this country would return back to God.

384
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:56,060
 The reality of God has been preserved here by believers.

385
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,660
 I'm talking about in America.

386
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,640
 Lots of examples of this.

387
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,060
 In God we trust on our money,

388
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,040
 of one nation under God and our pledge.

389
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,960
 Even in our language, things we say,

390
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,940
 like the blind leading the blind.

391
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,140
 This comes from the scriptures,

392
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,980
 an eye for an eye.

393
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,140
 This comes from Jesus.

394
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,300
 These were things he said

395
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,780
 that are just kind of indwelled in our culture.

396
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,100
 People say, I see the writing on the wall.

397
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,620
 Okay, those sayings come from the scriptures.

398
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,900
 The apple of my eye,

399
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,540
 out of the mouths of babes.

400
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,820
 There's lots of examples of these things that we say

401
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,360
 that actually come from the Bible

402
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,500
 that have been preserved in the culture that we live in.

403
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,100
 And did you know that about every 10 years,

404
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,100
 someone raises their hand,

405
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,660
 some expert atheist, and says,

406
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
 hey, the Bible will soon be irrelevant.

407
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,260
 In fact, it was Voltaire in the 1700s

408
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,780
 who said in 10 years, no one will be buying the Bible.

409
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,320
 No one will be reading the Bible.

410
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,860
 It will be completely irrelevant.

411
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,980
 This was in the 1700s.

412
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,540
 Today, 2014, is the bestseller.

413
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,500
 Not only the bestseller in the history of the world,

414
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,940
 the bestseller in 2014, the most read book,

415
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,540
 the most downloaded book, by about a margin of a billion.

416
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,500
 Okay, so second place isn't even really that close.

417
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,380
 And it's not even another book that you might think.

418
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,460
 It's not a book like the Quran.

419
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,500
 That's not second place.

420
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,340
 They've been wrong.

421
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,500
 The Bible's not going anywhere.

422
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,600
 I've read the back of the book.

423
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,700
 I know how this thing ends.

424
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,280
 Like Jesus comes back, white horse, you know,

425
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,900
 sword, crazy out of his mouth, robe dripped in blood,

426
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,900
 tattoo on his thigh, it's gonna be nuts.

427
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,540
 (congregation laughing)

428
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,500
 Like we know how this ends.

429
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,660
 And so you just get to play a part in it.

430
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,580
 Do I play a part in creating a place

431
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,080
 that Jesus is gonna return to?

432
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,300
 Or do I play a part in losing it

433
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,900
 with the peace that has been entrusted to me?

434
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,960
 Do I preserve it?

435
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,780
 Or do I not?

436
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,940
 As a follower of Jesus Christ, it's not really an option.

437
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,840
 Your purpose is to preserve and share the realities of God.

438
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,360
 And so in your purpose at work,

439
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,840
 wherever you went today, wherever you came here from,

440
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,680
 your purpose there,

441
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,000
 there in the middle of it is an eternal purpose.

442
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
 And the purpose of your hobbies,

443
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,200
 be it wakeboarding or art or whatever your hobbies are,

444
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,400
 in the middle of that is an eternal purpose.

445
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,100
 Something that God has entrusted to you,

446
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,980
 plans that he has for you that he prepared

447
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,940
 before the creation of the world, Ephesians 2:10,

448
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,880
 "For we are God's masterpiece,

449
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,940
 "his workmanship created in Christ Jesus to do good works,

450
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,600
 "which he has prepared in advance for us to do."

451
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,400
 This is your purpose,

452
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,300
 that you would preserve the realities of him.

453
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,420
 And this is why some people name their kids biblical names,

454
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,180
 preserving a culture.

455
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,420
 There's not a lot of Judas's running around.

456
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,920
 I don't know if you haven't noticed that.

457
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,960
 (congregation laughing)

458
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,260
 There's not, there are a lot of Matthews,

459
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,580
 there are a lot of Johns,

460
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,220
 not many Judas's.

461
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,560
 This is why about 50 of you,

462
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,680
 every couple months,

463
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,940
 give up your weekend to go and share the gospel

464
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,100
 on the street in a weekend we call Unashamed Weekend.

465
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,020
 I wanna tell you how that started.

466
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,020
 If you haven't heard about it,

467
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,300
 we do this deal called Unashamed,

468
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,540
 and it's where we go and we live kind of in West Dallas,

469
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,740
 and we do service projects,

470
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,580
 and throughout the day,

471
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,960
 we just share the gospel with people

472
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,580
 in the very places that you might go out in,

473
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,900
 like Uptown and Lower Greenville and Deep Ellum,

474
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,740
 and we're just like,

475
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,880
 "Hey, can we talk to you about Jesus?"

476
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,720
 Not in weird ways,

477
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,820
 but, "Hey, what are you doing?

478
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,060
 "Hey, I'd like to get to know you,

479
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,660
 "and by the way, I know how you can live forever."

480
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,580
 And so, as we do that,

481
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,620
 I wanna tell you how that started.

482
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,460
 We were in Haiti, okay?

483
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,300
 And so there was a group of us,

484
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,140
 a group of porch leaders,

485
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,620
 we were in Haiti,

486
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,540
 and we were in this village,

487
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,460
 and there was this interpreter there named Villerson,

488
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,460
 and so Villerson is our guy who is our translator,

489
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,680
 and we're going kind of door to door in Haiti,

490
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,480
 and it's really frustrating

491
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,200
 sharing the gospel through an interpreter.

492
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,040
 I don't know if you've ever done it,

493
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,200
 but you're like, "Hey, God loves you so much,

494
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,540
 "and you've been separated from him by your sin,

495
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,260
 "and he loves you so much,

496
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,720
 "he sent Jesus, where was I?

497
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,200
 "Jesus to die for his sin."

498
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,040
 It's just real frustrating.

499
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,920
 So Villerson, who became a friend of ours,

500
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,720
 and was a Christian, was a Christ follower,

501
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,360
 he knew the gospel clearly, right?

502
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,580
 And so I'm like, "Dude, these are your people,

503
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,420
 "just tell them."

504
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,040
 And this particular village that we were in,

505
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,880
 it was his village,

506
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,000
 it was the village where he was from.

507
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,480
 And so I was sitting there,

508
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
 and I'm like, "Hey, Villerson,

509
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,220
 "I don't wanna do the whole interpreter game,

510
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,980
 "just tell them the gospel.

511
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,380
 "Just tell them what Jesus has done for them."

512
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,840
 And that night we were kind of debriefing

513
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,600
 that frustration among our team.

514
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,520
 And several felt it,

515
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,560
 talking to people and not understanding the language.

516
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,400
 And I told them, I'm like,

517
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,880
 "Hey, I just told Villerson, man, just tell him."

518
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,700
 And one of the guys said,

519
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,980
 "Hey, you know you're asking him

520
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,060
 "to knock on his neighbor's door

521
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,600
 "and just share the gospel."

522
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,420
 I said, "Yeah, exactly,

523
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,960
 "that's exactly what I'm asking him to do."

524
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,480
 He goes, "But we don't do that."

525
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,200
 And I said, "Be quiet, young man, you will not know."

526
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,520
 (congregation laughing)

527
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,160
 I said, "You're exactly right, we don't do that."

528
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,400
 My friend Ryan Wall and Allie Wall,

529
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,420
 who are on our staff now,

530
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,460
 they were there, they weren't on our staff then.

531
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,320
 And Ryan just said, "When we get back to Dallas,

532
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,600
 "we're going to do that."

533
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,000
 We're going to move throughout the streets

534
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,600
 of Dallas and Fort Worth,

535
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,040
 and we're going to declare the gospel,

536
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,500
 'cause I cannot ask this young man to do it,

537
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,360
 unless I'm willing to do that.

538
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,300
 And so Unashamed Weekend was born.

539
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,640
 Because I see the same frustrations

540
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,560
 every single time I return from one of these trips.

541
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,120
 People get back on the airplane,

542
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,820
 and they usually had a life-changing time.

543
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,920
 In fact, in a few weeks, I'm going to tell all of you,

544
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
 if you haven't been overseas

545
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,400
 for the purpose of sharing the gospel, let's go.

546
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,300
 But they get on the plane,

547
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,440
 and there's a point of frustration,

548
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,760
 'cause they say, they wish two things.

549
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,120
 I've heard it over and over.

550
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,760
 I wish I understood the language.

551
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,600
 I wish I could share with them in their own language.

552
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,040
 And I wish I understood the culture.

553
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,800
 And the irony.

554
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,720
 We get on an airplane to return back to a place

555
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,120
 where we understand the culture,

556
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,440
 and we speak the language.

557
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,240
 We're not taking the gospel to Haiti.

558
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,560
 It's already there.

559
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,800
 There are churches in Haiti.

560
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,400
 We're not taking the gospel to Haiti

561
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,500
 any more than we are Dallas or Fort Worth.

562
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,100
 We are preserving a culture of Christ in Haiti,

563
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,120
 exactly as we should in Dallas and Fort Worth.

564
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,140
 And do you know something else

565
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,480
 that happens every single time?

566
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,920
 Every trip I've been on, the same conversation happens.

567
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,280
 People come up to me, and they're so excited.

568
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,120
 They say, JP, JP, bro,

569
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,080
 I've never felt so alive.

570
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,680
 Woke up in the morning.

571
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,640
 God helped me share the gospel faithfully and courageously.

572
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,800
 Go to breakfast, hey, who can I share the gospel with?

573
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,200
 Go to lunch, who can I share the gospel?

574
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,880
 Go to dinner, who can I share the gospel with?

575
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,640
 All in between.

576
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,480
 Go to bed.

577
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,080
 JP, I've never felt so alive.

578
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,960
 I say, that's because for the first time

579
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,920
 you are living within your purpose.

580
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,520
 And I want you to be abundantly clear

581
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,980
 as to what they're saying.

582
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,880
 Some of you, you need to take this personally.

583
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,920
 They're saying, I've found life in a way that you haven't.

584
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,760
 Many of you.

585
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:04,880
 I have found life to the fullest and abundantly

586
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,400
 in a way that many of you haven't

587
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,800
 as you continue to pursue life in uptown

588
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,480
 and lower Greenville and Deep Ellum

589
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,140
 or wherever that may be, Addison.

590
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,040
 Or in Fort Worth, Sundance Square,

591
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,520
 or Billy Bob's or wherever in Fort Worth.

592
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,560
 They say, hey, I found something

593
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,400
 that you haven't yet found.

594
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,200
 I found life in a more bigger way than you have.

595
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,440
 And I'm just standing up here saying,

596
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,680
 man, I want that for you.

597
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,560
 I want that for you every day, every week.

598
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,160
 I've never known life like this,

599
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,100
 life of sharing my faith.

600
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,960
 Your purpose is to show Christ to a world

601
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,840
 that desperately needs him.

602
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,760
 Yesterday, as I was preparing for this message,

603
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,480
 I wanted to be in the city, so I was at Mudsmith

604
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,160
 down in lower Greenville and bumped into a guy

605
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,480
 who goes here and he just said,

606
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,400
 hey, what is your favorite thing

607
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,760
 about doing ministry with young adults?

608
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,720
 I said, easy, bro.

609
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,020
 Easy, man.

610
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,820
 Watching them be repurposed.

611
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,320
 He said, what do you mean?

612
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,960
 I was like, watching folks who come in,

613
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,320
 they're like the rich young ruler,

614
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,040
 like they have all these gifts and talents

615
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,440
 and they're so focused on using them for them

616
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,640
 and they like think they're Christian,

617
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,900
 but they've never lived Christian.

618
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,480
 They just kind of go on to church

619
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,840
 every now and then, maybe every weekend.

620
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,480
 And watching them really get it,

621
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,220
 get lit up with the Holy Spirit,

622
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,160
 like ready to just run through walls for the sake of Jesus

623
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,680
 and tell everybody, their coworker,

624
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,720
 lose their job sharing the gospel.

625
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,640
 Watching them find life for the first time,

626
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,420
 find purpose for the first time.

627
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,020
 Hands down, my favorite thing.

628
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:44,480
 Jesus goes, verse 14.

629
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,600
 You're the light of the world.

630
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,960
 A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.

631
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,520
 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.

632
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,160
 Instead, they put it on its stand

633
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,760
 and it gives light to everyone in the house.

634
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,280
 And so Jesus is talking now

635
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,120
 about the specific positioning of the light.

636
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,200
 He's saying, hey, if you're a light,

637
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,640
 you have to give off light.

638
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,740
 A light that doesn't give off light is not a light.

639
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,480
 It's a bulb, you know, it's not a light.

640
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,120
 A light gives off light.

641
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,460
 And so if you're a Christian, you give off light.

642
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,240
 You are by which, the way by which people see.

643
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,800
 You are drawing them to Christ.

644
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,640
 You think about this,

645
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,880
 like we are people obsessed with lights, right?

646
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,640
 Some of you are like, I just, I got that.

647
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,520
 Like half of you just went, huh?

648
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,760
 Let me explain it.

649
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,600
 You ever heard this?

650
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
 Oh, come out here, you gotta see the stars.

651
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,820
 Oh, hey, do you wanna go look at Christmas lights?

652
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,840
 Hey, guess what?

653
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,200
 Kaboom town, man.

654
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,880
 Fireworks.

655
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,980
 Lights in the sky.

656
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,820
 Well, you get it?

657
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,660
 We are a people obsessed with lights.

658
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,060
 We're like moths, man, light.

659
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,820
 You know?

660
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,900
 Moth to a flame, we are.

661
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,280
 And so if you're a light, people are drawn to you, right?

662
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,500
 And Jesus is just saying,

663
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,740
 hey, I put lights in real specific places.

664
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,740
 So my second point is, you have a place.

665
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,820
 You have been entrusted with a place.

666
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,540
 In the first century, lights were very expensive.

667
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:18,200
 In 2014, lights are still very expensive.

668
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,580
 They typically had one in their house

669
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,180
 and they would put it where it really mattered.

670
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,340
 They would never put it under something.

671
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,500
 Jesus is saying something preposterous.

672
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,940
 He was like, you would never do this.

673
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,360
 In the same way, I put lights in very specific places.

674
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,140
 Just like I put them in specific places in my house,

675
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,300
 God put them specific places in the world.

676
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,900
 Now, I will tell you, some burn brighter than others.

677
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,180
 Some shine a little brighter than others.

678
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,380
 But for you not to share your faith

679
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,280
 is as crazy as installing a light under a couch

680
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,420
 or under a chair.

681
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,520
 You would never do it.

682
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,680
 So as you live out your purpose,

683
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,940
 you live out your purpose in the place that God has put you.

684
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,580
 Acts 17, verse 26, just to show you how profound and real

685
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,180
 this idea is that God has given you a place, it says this.

686
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,400
 From one man he made all the nations, he being God,

687
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,620
 that they should inhabit the whole earth.

688
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,440
 And he marked out their appointed times in history.

689
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,420
 That's 2014 for you and me.

690
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,740
 And the boundaries of their lands.

691
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,460
 He established when you would live and where you would live

692
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,580
 before the creation of the world.

693
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,980
 God, who is sovereign and has a plan for you,

694
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,800
 determined when you would live,

695
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,620
 when you would actually exist in history

696
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,020
 and where you would live.

697
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,580
 He determined your boundaries.

698
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,620
 So what do I mean by boundaries?

699
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,540
 Do I just mean Dallas?

700
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,540
 Do I just mean Fort Worth?

701
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,220
 No, I mean not just your neighborhood,

702
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,980
 not just your apartment complex, I mean your Starbucks.

703
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,040
 I mean your Tom Thumb or Kroger, your grocery store.

704
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,020
 Do you see that?

705
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,620
 I mean that your gas station, the place that you go back to,

706
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,500
 your anthropology or your mall

707
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,160
 or whatever that is for you, right?

708
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,860
 That place that you go where they like know you,

709
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,700
 you walk, oh hey, what's up, Chris?

710
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,540
 Hey, what's up?

711
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,040
 That's your boundaries.

712
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,820
 And he did it intentionally.

713
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,460
 He put you there intentionally,

714
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,740
 your job where you go to every single day.

715
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:24,980
 Is God intentionally moving through your life

716
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,300
 like you're a pawn on a chessboard and he's moving you?

717
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,860
 He's like do battle here, shine light here,

718
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,300
 shine light here.

719
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,940
 I really hope for some of you right now

720
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,860
 it's like there's a light bulb going off

721
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,400
 and you're like oh man, I've gotta change the way I shop.

722
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,660
 I've gotta change the way I get gas.

723
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,860
 I've gotta change the way I get coffee.

724
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,580
 There's more purpose in this than I actually thought.

725
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,940
 Lights also push back darkness.

726
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,500
 That's what they do where there's light,

727
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:08,500
 darkness can't be and our country's growing dim.

728
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,100
 It's only because people have stopped shining.

729
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,540
 That's it.

730
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,180
 One generation, that's what they're saying about you, man.

731
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,660
 That's what they're saying about you and your peers.

732
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,180
 There's a concentration of Christianity happening.

733
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,700
 Let me explain.

734
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,540
 All these people who went through the world

735
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,620
 calling themselves Christians

736
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,060
 are kind of realizing they're not

737
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,020
 and so they're saying no, I'm not anymore.

738
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,540
 And that's not altogether bad

739
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:38,140
 because some of you in your 20s and 30s,

740
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,780
 you're realizing you are

741
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,140
 and you're rejecting cultural Christianity

742
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,060
 and it's affecting the way you date,

743
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,500
 the way you shop, the way you live,

744
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,780
 the way you share, the way you shine.

745
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:54,020
 And you're saying I will give my life for this Jesus.

746
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,300
 I will die for this Jesus.

747
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,780
 And that is the call on your life.

748
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,660
 Yeah, you guys can clap for that if you believe that.

749
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,220
 (congregation applauding)

750
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:11,100
 Some of you are like, but JP, my work, it's so dark.

751
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,380
 Good, God put a light there in you.

752
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,700
 Corporate America is the darkest mission field

753
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,540
 I've ever seen.

754
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,740
 I live there, I work there.

755
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,700
 Just to quantify that, I mean, I've been to Africa,

756
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,940
 I've been to the jungles of Africa, the bush of Africa.

757
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,900
 I've been to Haiti, I've been to the Amazon jungle,

758
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,460
 I've been to Brazil, I've been down the Amazon for four days

759
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,460
 to reach a people that have never been reached.

760
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,460
 I've been to Mexico for the purpose of sharing the gospel.

761
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,300
 I've been to these places,

762
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,460
 the darkest mission field I've ever seen

763
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,460
 was right here in DFW.

764
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,020
 And you know what's crazy?

765
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:51,700
 Let me tell you something that's crazy.

766
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,460
 Today, right now, I could go to Brazil, I could go to Haiti,

767
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,420
 I could go to Africa, I could go to places

768
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,700
 where the UN would say, don't go here.

769
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,740
 Our government would say, no, don't go to that place.

770
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,740
 And I could go there, I mean, I could get a visa

771
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,260
 to Brazil today, I could go to the Congo,

772
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,420
 I mean, purchase a plane ticket, I could be there tomorrow.

773
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,220
 That's what's crazy.

774
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,700
 You know one place I can't be?

775
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:22,620
 The eighth floor of AT&T where I worked for four years,

776
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,060
 every day.

777
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,900
 Because I'd have to go through security, I had this badge

778
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,820
 and I would swipe it and go through security

779
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,220
 and I was there every single day in this cube farm.

780
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,180
 And today, I can't be there.

781
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:38,220
 I can't, and I'm not even sure, let me strike that.

782
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,060
 I'm certain that I wasn't as faithful

783
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,220
 as I should have been.

784
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:48,540
 I'm certain that there are people who God wanted to save

785
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,140
 and they're not saved right now

786
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,420
 because I didn't faithfully share with them.

787
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,420
 Because I pursued my comfort

788
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,140
 and I thought it might be awkward.

789
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,220
 I love what David said a couple months ago,

790
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,620
 he's like, man, I don't know,

791
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,340
 like it would be really difficult to explain

792
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,580
 to the Apostle Paul why we didn't share the gospel.

793
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,260
 He'd be like, whoa, because they're gonna put you in prison?

794
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,220
 You're like, no.

795
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,180
 Because they're gonna torture you?

796
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,860
 You're like, no, not really.

797
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,660
 But why, why aren't you sharing?

798
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,940
 That's awkward.

799
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,220
 You know, I'm not sure you'd understand what that means.

800
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,340
 I'm not sure you'd get it.

801
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,140
 And it's awkward because we haven't been loving

802
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,100
 in the places that have been entrusted to us.

803
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,300
 It's not awkward when you've been like

804
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,380
 the hardest worker there

805
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,940
 and caring for your employees so well

806
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,140
 that they're like, man, I'll trust you

807
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,980
 with anything you say.

808
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,940
 What, this dude died and came back to life?

809
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,900
 Okay, I'm in.

810
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,460
 It's not awkward when we're lights

811
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,820
 and we're shining brightly.

812
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,140
 It's less awkward.

813
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,260
 So I can't go to the eighth floor of AT&T

814
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,020
 where I was every day, five days a week

815
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:02,300
 with the people there working with them every day.

816
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,660
 I also can't go behind the counter at Starbucks

817
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,500
 where you might be.

818
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,660
 I also can't go into that restaurant

819
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,460
 with those servers back into the kitchen.

820
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,340
 I also can't go to that building

821
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,500
 that you've been entrusted to

822
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,860
 or Dallas ISD in the teacher's lounge

823
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,860
 or Richardson ISD or wherever it is that you work

824
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,700
 or you hang out with those engineers

825
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,580
 or those other financial advisors

826
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,740
 or whatever it is that you do.

827
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,860
 I'm not there.

828
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,420
 But God put a light there

829
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,220
 and he put a light there to shine.

830
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,380
 That's your place.

831
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:39,020
 In the same way, verse 16,

832
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,900
 let your light shine before others

833
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,820
 that they may see your good deeds

834
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,820
 and glorify your Father in heaven.

835
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,100
 I wanna ask a question around this line.

836
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,660
 It says, one you may have heard before.

837
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,860
 Let your light shine before others

838
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,020
 that they may see your good deeds

839
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,500
 and glorify your Father in heaven.

840
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,300
 Who are the others and who are the they?

841
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,620
 Let your light shine.

842
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,100
 Who am I supposed to let my light shine before?

843
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,900
 It says others and they.

844
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,220
 And my third point is you have people.

845
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,940
 You have a people and a place

846
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,740
 that you're to live out your purpose with.

847
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,420
 There are people in the places that you go to,

848
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,100
 the boundaries that have been marked out for,

849
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,660
 where you are to live out your purpose

850
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,020
 of being salt and light.

851
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,020
 You have a people.

852
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,540
 And so who are the others and the they?

853
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,580
 They're your people.

854
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,980
 And so like where is that?

855
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,980
 Well, where do light shine?

856
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,700
 Simply put, like your headlights,

857
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,980
 they shine right in front of you.

858
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,140
 Lights in a house, they shine where they're put,

859
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,460
 where they're placed.

860
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,580
 And so wherever you are, wherever place you're in,

861
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,660
 the people around you, they are the darkness

862
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,140
 and you are the light.

863
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,540
 You are the way that they are going to see the way

864
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,380
 to eternity.

865
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,420
 There's not another plan.

866
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:02,100
 Okay, I've read that if you don't share, rocks will cry out.

867
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,060
 But right now, rocks aren't crying out, it's just you.

868
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,260
 You're the light there.

869
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,860
 God said, hey, I love you and trust you so much,

870
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,660
 I put people around you, that you would shine a light

871
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,300
 into their heart so that they might see

872
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,300
 how they could live with me forever.

873
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,100
 That you would be the light that they're drawn to,

874
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,620
 like fireworks, like Christmas lights, like stars.

875
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:31,140
 And Dallas, I assume Fort Worth is so dark,

876
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,820
 if you just shine at all, you're probably gonna stand out.

877
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,380
 If you just shine a little bit, you're gonna stand out.

878
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,220
 They're gonna see you, man.

879
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,860
 There's something different about this one.

880
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,380
 Hey man, let me ask you a question.

881
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,780
 Why don't you go party with them?

882
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,500
 Don't you know we were at Happy Hour last night?

883
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,220
 Dude, I got wasted, it was so fun.

884
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,780
 Man, Mary had that lampshade on her head, it was crazy.

885
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,140
 How come you weren't there?

886
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,660
 Hey man, let me ask you.

887
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,340
 I noticed that you get here early,

888
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,020
 and you just work harder than everyone else.

889
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,700
 Almost like you're not working for man,

890
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,380
 but working for something else.

891
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,340
 Hey man, I just noticed the way that you love,

892
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,660
 like you're so intentional with the dude

893
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,980
 who never goes to lunch, like you ask him to lunch.

894
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,420
 It seems like you just can care,

895
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,740
 like you're not trying to get,

896
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,420
 you're not so concerned about yourself,

897
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,900
 you're concerned about everyone else around you.

898
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,420
 Like why do you do that?

899
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,380
 Why do you shine so bright?

900
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,180
 What are you doing?

901
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,340
 Who do you worship?

902
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,380
 How can I worship him?

903
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,820
 Who are your people?

904
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,660
 Three groups, I believe.

905
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,500
 I'll go through this quickly.

906
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,900
 The first one is your family.

907
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,980
 If you trusted Christ late in your life,

908
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,460
 your family should see a change in you.

909
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,420
 I will tell you, I believe family is the most difficult.

910
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,260
 Jesus said that a prophet is not welcome in his own town,

911
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,860
 and referring to family,

912
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,060
 or those there that have rejected him,

913
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,300
 that know him, that knew him the closest.

914
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,020
 But you share with love,

915
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,860
 you share consistently,

916
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,660
 and don't fall into old traps.

917
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,500
 See, I know it's like, well, I'm the baby of the family,

918
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,740
 like that, I've never just really kind of grown past that.

919
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,340
 Listen, share with love, share consistently,

920
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,460
 and don't fall into old traps.

921
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,620
 What I mean by old traps is like,

922
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,260
 if you and your dad always get into an argument,

923
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,140
 like, avoid that argument, and say,

924
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,340
 hey, I'm sorry, will you forgive me?

925
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,940
 Like, growing up, I did these things, will you forgive me?

926
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,260
 But I found something really good

927
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,140
 that I want you to know about.

928
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,660
 I want you to know there's been a change in my life

929
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,780
 I wanna share with you.

930
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,460
 The second group is your neighbors.

931
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,660
 Guys, this is the layup, man.

932
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,020
 Do you know your neighbors?

933
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,340
 Like, do you know the people that live

934
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,460
 on both sides of you, and above you, and below you?

935
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,300
 Do you know them?

936
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,860
 And I don't mean do you know their names.

937
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,780
 I mean, do you know them?

938
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,940
 Do you know what they love to do?

939
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,580
 Do you know what religion they are?

940
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,580
 Oh, you're Muslim?

941
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,740
 Man, I'd love to hear about that.

942
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,700
 How did you become Muslim?

943
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,540
 Were you raised Muslim?

944
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,700
 What did that look like?

945
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,140
 Oh, you're of the Baha'i faith?

946
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,460
 What is the Baha'i faith?

947
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,420
 Tell me about that.

948
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,900
 Hey, do you wanna come over and have dinner

949
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,940
 with me and my roommates this weekend?

950
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,100
 Man, I'd love to get to know you.

951
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,540
 God, in his sovereignty, placed me right next door to you.

952
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,740
 And some of us are just like,

953
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,940
 you want me to go and share with the people

954
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,580
 who are always so loud?

955
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,260
 (congregation laughing)

956
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,740
 Yes.

957
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,060
 Plainly put, yes.

958
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,500
 Yeah, the people, they constantly make all the noise

959
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,900
 above you.

960
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,900
 Go love on them and tell them about Jesus,

961
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,100
 and maybe they'll stop making so much noise.

962
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,420
 (congregation laughing)

963
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,620
 And share with your coworkers.

964
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,020
 We talked a lot about this.

965
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,100
 Third group, your coworkers, your people.

966
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:39,380
 The people on the other side of the cube from you,

967
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,820
 the people on the other side of the wall from you,

968
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,060
 that other barista, that other teacher,

969
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:48,180
 that other financial advisor, that other engineer,

970
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,020
 that other artist, that other graphic designer,

971
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,780
 whatever you are.

972
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,940
 The other one, the one around you,

973
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,620
 the one that's right there every single day,

974
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,660
 the one you like, the one you don't like.

975
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,540
 Do you know them?

976
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:05,020
 Not their name, do you know their upbringing?

977
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,140
 Do you know where they're from?

978
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,300
 Do you know what they do?

979
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,580
 Do you love them?

980
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,980
 This is what it looks like to be salt and light.

981
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:16,300
 Do you actually care where they're going to spend eternity?

982
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:22,700
 I heard a guy say, as an atheist,

983
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,540
 say how much do you have to hate someone not to tell them?

984
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,860
 Man, you've been given grace.

985
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,700
 Someone shared with you.

986
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,580
 Can you imagine if they hadn't?

987
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:37,100
 Someone shared with you.

988
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:43,100
 Romans one, verse 16 says this.

989
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,260
 For I'm not ashamed of the gospel

990
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,340
 because it is the power of God

991
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,460
 that brings salvation to everyone who believes.

992
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:56,220
 First to the Jew and then to the Gentile.

993
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:01,980
 For I am not ashamed of the gospel

994
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,620
 because it is the power of God that brings salvation.

995
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,500
 Save their eternity.

996
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,620
 They go from hell to heaven with God forever.

997
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,900
 To everyone who believes upon this,

998
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,900
 first to the Jew and then to us and to your peers

999
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,340
 and to your family and to your neighbors.

1000
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,140
 They will be with God forever.

1001
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:25,260
 I just have a hunch there's going to be

1002
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:29,140
 a little bit of gratitude waiting there for you.

1003
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,220
 Thank you so much for telling me

1004
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:38,220
 that I could be with God, Jehovah, Creator,

1005
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:42,660
 forever and ever in paradise.

1006
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,820
 That I didn't have to go there

1007
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:48,380
 where there's weeping and gnashing of teeth.

1008
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,980
 Whatever that is, it sounds awful.

1009
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,220
 I don't want to be there.

1010
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:57,220
 I heard one professor say it like this,

1011
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:02,300
 that when he's sharing, he thinks of people

1012
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,780
 like barrels of gunpowder.

1013
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,980
 Like he's lighting matches at barrels of gunpowder

1014
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,980
 and some of the barrels are empty.

1015
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,900
 And so sometimes he lights a match and he throws it

1016
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,900
 and nothing happens.

1017
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,540
 Lights a match, throws it, nothing happens.

1018
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,620
 Sometimes he lights a match and he throws it.

1019
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,340
 (explosion)

1020
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,820
 Salvation happens.

1021
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,820
 The light bulb turns on.

1022
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,020
 An eternal destiny is changed.

1023
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,100
 And he doesn't know which is which.

1024
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,380
 He doesn't know which of the barrels

1025
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,100
 have gunpowder in them, which of them don't.

1026
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,820
 So he's just faithfully sharing the gospel.

1027
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,780
 Because we are not in charge of the outcome.

1028
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,220
 God's in charge of the outcome.

1029
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,540
 We're in charge of obedience.

1030
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,860
 You cannot judge obedience by the outcome.

1031
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,660
 Obedience looks like sharing.

1032
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,620
 That's the victory, that's what we celebrate.

1033
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,180
 The conversion, that's up to God.

1034
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,420
 You had nothing to do with that.

1035
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,740
 You shared faithfully.

1036
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,820
 So when you share, we celebrate.

1037
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,580
 When someone is converted,

1038
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,340
 the angels and the saints, they celebrate.

1039
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,940
 You have no idea whose name is written in the book of life.

1040
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,460
 So you share with everyone.

1041
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,380
 That makes it easy.

1042
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,220
 Who do I share with?

1043
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,740
 Everyone.

1044
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,700
 But I'll be the weird guy.

1045
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,740
 Cool, man, you have the biggest house in heaven.

1046
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,580
 I don't know.

1047
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,420
 How do we share?

1048
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,060
 Real quick, how do we share?

1049
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,500
 I'm gonna keep it simple because sometimes

1050
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,740
 I think the bridge illustration

1051
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,460
 and all the illustrations just confuse things.

1052
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,300
 Three simple steps, you ready?

1053
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,140
 Okay.

1054
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:25,300
 Engage.

1055
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,740
 First step, engage.

1056
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:34,060
 When you came in, you were given a top 10 list.

1057
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,860
 You write down 10 names of people you wanna engage with.

1058
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,020
 10 names that you're committed to praying for faithfully.

1059
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,900
 Put that in your Bible, hold on to it,

1060
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,180
 look at it every day and just pray

1061
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,980
 through those 10 names every day and watch God have fun.

1062
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:48,260
 Watch God have fun with you.

1063
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,500
 Have fun answering your prayer.

1064
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,100
 Pray faithfully.

1065
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,100
 Okay.

1066
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,940
 And so you engage.

1067
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,940
 What does engaging look like?

1068
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,100
 Okay, engaging looks like not for the purpose

1069
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,820
 of sharing the gospel, it just looks like loving people.

1070
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,100
 And I'm serious about this.

1071
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,100
 Like if you're like in the back of your mind,

1072
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,020
 like okay, I gotta transition this somehow.

1073
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,220
 Hey man, like what's up?

1074
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,020
 Like hey, watch the Cowboys.

1075
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,380
 Man, did you know you're gonna go to hell

1076
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,580
 unless you trust in Jesus?

1077
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,100
 (congregation laughing)

1078
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,100
 Don't go there, okay?

1079
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,660
 What's up, bro?

1080
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,460
 I was at Mudsmith yesterday, met Robert.

1081
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,380
 What's up, Robert?

1082
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:25,620
 Hey man, how long have you lived in Dallas?

1083
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,940
 Eight years, where before Dallas?

1084
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,340
 Frisco, oh that's still kinda Dallas, bro.

1085
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,060
 (congregation laughing)

1086
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,940
 And we're just talking now.

1087
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:35,780
 Where are you from?

1088
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,620
 Oh man, I'm from Quero.

1089
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,620
 Oh yeah, of course you never heard of it.

1090
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,980
 I lived in Waco, then now Dallas.

1091
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,740
 Ah man, so how long have you worked here?

1092
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,380
 We're just talking, man.

1093
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,460
 No big deal, just people, being people, just talking.

1094
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:52,020
 Hey Robert, let me ask you a question.

1095
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,580
 You have a faith?

1096
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,300
 I've asked that question literally hundreds of times.

1097
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,780
 I made sure that was a true statement,

1098
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,500
 literally hundreds of times.

1099
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,900
 I've gotten the same answer every single time I've asked.

1100
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,740
 You ready?

1101
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,740
 Hey, do you have a faith?

1102
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,780
 A what?

1103
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:09,180
 Every time, no one has ever answered anything but a what?

1104
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,780
 They're like, a face?

1105
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,820
 Yes, I have a faith.

1106
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:17,820
 No, a faith, a religion, a spirituality, a belief.

1107
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,940
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm Christian.

1108
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,540
 Yeah, no, no, I'm atheist.

1109
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,620
 No, no, man, I was raised in the church,

1110
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:25,700
 I haven't been in a long time.

1111
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,340
 Now we're talking about it, that transition.

1112
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,460
 How we got there.

1113
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,380
 It was easy, it wasn't hard, it wasn't difficult.

1114
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,700
 My palms aren't sweaty or anything.

1115
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,140
 Just like, hey man, I just wanna know your story.

1116
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,460
 And now I'm asking you about something

1117
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,260
 that's important to me, do you have a faith?

1118
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,140
 Can I tell you why I asked that and now,

1119
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,840
 so the first step is engage, the second step is share.

1120
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,300
 Let me show you how I share.

1121
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,340
 Hey Robert, here's why I asked that, bro.

1122
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,940
 12 years ago I was in a bar,

1123
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,300
 not far from where we're at right now,

1124
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,980
 just a block away.

1125
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,580
 I was upstairs and someone invited me to church.

1126
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,700
 I had been to church my whole life,

1127
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,740
 I had heard about Jesus,

1128
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:03,940
 but I went in the back of this church,

1129
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,340
 I was hungover, I sat in the back row,

1130
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,420
 I smelled like smoke from the club from the night before.

1131
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,140
 And I heard something for the first time,

1132
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,100
 it was the reality that I didn't have to pay for my sins.

1133
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:17,020
 That God loved me so much that he sent his own son,

1134
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,940
 Jesus Christ, to pay for my sins.

1135
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,040
 And we shouldn't know about Jesus, Robert.

1136
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,060
 No one should know about Jesus,

1137
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,860
 he was a carpenter from nowhere, Bethlehem.

1138
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,100
 You couldn't point to it on a map

1139
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,860
 except for Jesus was from there.

1140
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,820
 You ever heard of Nazareth?

1141
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,960
 You shouldn't know where it is

1142
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,720
 except for that's where Jesus lived.

1143
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,540
 You know when he was born?

1144
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:38,740
 2014 years ago, in a day that we started counting from.

1145
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:41,660
 Literally our calendar is based on his birth.

1146
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,820
 There's some significance about this guy, Jesus, Robert.

1147
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:49,740
 And when I realized that Jesus died for my sins

1148
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,240
 and that God raised him from the dead,

1149
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,960
 Robert, everything changed in my life.

1150
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,680
 I was a dude who loved to party, I loved sex,

1151
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,200
 I loved having fun by the world's standards.

1152
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,560
 Usually resulted in a hangover of some sorts.

1153
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,840
 And God changed me, Robert.

1154
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,900
 And so now I'm just committed to sharing that story

1155
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,400
 with anyone who will listen, and today that's you.

1156
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,940
 Share, engage, share, lastly, invite.

1157
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:20,100
 Hey Robert, what they did up there,

1158
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,000
 12 years ago when I was at the Beagle,

1159
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,640
 they invited me to church.

1160
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,240
 Robert, I wanna invite you to church, man.

1161
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,580
 My family would love to pick you up.

1162
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,680
 We would love for you to go with us.

1163
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,240
 In fact, tomorrow, Tuesday, seven o'clock,

1164
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,900
 we're gonna be at this deal called The Porch.

1165
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,580
 It's the biggest party in town, Robert.

1166
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,860
 God's doing incredible work through young adults,

1167
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,280
 20s and 30s just like you.

1168
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,160
 But I'd love for you to come.

1169
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,580
 I'd love for you to see what he's doing.

1170
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,960
 Would you come and hang out with me?

1171
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,800
 Engage, share, invite is the last one.

1172
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,920
 Invite, will you come with me?

1173
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,340
 I'm showing you how God loves you.

1174
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,460
 I wanna take you to a group of people

1175
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,900
 who would love to show you how God loves you.

1176
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,860
 Will you come with me?

1177
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:13,000
 Be a light, engage, share, invite, it even rhymes.

1178
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,040
 And so in summary, you have a purpose to show Christ

1179
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,940
 to a world that desperately needs him.

1180
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,900
 You have a place wherever God has put you

1181
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,800
 and you have a people, those around you,

1182
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,780
 your family, your neighbors, and your coworkers.

1183
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,360
 My team and I, we're waging war on your behalf

1184
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,360
 because I know that it's dark out there.

1185
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:40,100
 I will tell you, I've grown to a place

1186
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,760
 where I enjoy sharing the gospel.

1187
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,400
 No one has ever cussed me out, no one's ever hit me.

1188
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,940
 I know our mind goes to the worst things.

1189
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,680
 It's gonna be okay.

1190
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,360
 God loves you, he's sovereign.

1191
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,600
 You know, he's kinda asked you to do this.

1192
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,720
 But I know it's dark out there.

1193
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,360
 I know there is a lot of evil in the world.

1194
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,200
 And you are the soldiers, you are the warriors,

1195
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,940
 you are the light that exists to push back the darkness.

1196
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,460
 And so for just a second, if we can,

1197
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,280
 please don't get up, please don't move around.

1198
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,620
 If we just, for a second, can we just feel

1199
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,920
 the weight of that darkness?

1200
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,880
 I'm gonna bring down the lights.

1201
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,000
 If you would just hang tight for just a second,

1202
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,200
 it won't be long at all.

1203
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,120
 If you're scared of the dark,

1204
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,220
 hold someone's hand next to you.

1205
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,740
 We're just going to bring down the lights.

1206
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:28,360
 And I want you to know that you're like,

1207
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,700
 JP, you don't understand my family, bro.

1208
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,640
 It's dark there.

1209
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,480
 You want me to share with my neighbors?

1210
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,840
 Bro, I live in Deep Ellum, it's dark there.

1211
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,940
 You want me to share at work, JP?

1212
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,960
 In my cube, you don't understand who I work with.

1213
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,960
 It's dark there, to which I say, God has a light.

1214
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,460
 He has put a light right where he needs it.

1215
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:02,640
 And there you are, so that people can see.

1216
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,200
 And when people begin to see

1217
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:10,440
 that there's something different about you,

1218
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,440
 the cool thing about that light is it spreads.

1219
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,320
 It spreads.

1220
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,200
 It spreads throughout Dallas.

1221
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,680
 It spreads throughout Fort Worth.

1222
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,680
 And the culture that is the reality that God is,

1223
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:33,360
 that God created, it is preserved.

1224
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,320
 And this is your mission, friends.

1225
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,620
 This is why you have breath in your lungs.

1226
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,800
 This is why your heart beats in your chest.

1227
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,820
 This, my friends, is your purpose.

1228
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,720
 That you would live for sharing this eternal truth,

1229
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,480
 that others would come into the light,

1230
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,640
 that the culture of Christianity

1231
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,420
 and of Christ would be preserved.

1232
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:03,420
 It would not be lost in your generation, not on our time.

1233
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,560
 Can we bring the house lights back?

1234
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,780
 (congregation applauding)

1235
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,140
 Tonight, we're gonna do something fun in just a moment.

1236
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,820
 So if you would not leave as we worship in this last song,

1237
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,460
 I'm gonna invite the band, Robbie C,

1238
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,580
 and his crew back up here.

1239
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:21,840
 And let me pray for us as we close out here.

1240
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,980
 But again, I'll be back in just one moment.

1241
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:27,260
 Oh, Father, we realize that the essence

1242
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:32,260
 of being a Christian is that we share in the same way

1243
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,840
 that the essence of being a light is that we shine.

1244
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,180
 Oh, Father, would you help us shine?

1245
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,220
 Father, we have received power from you,

1246
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:47,300
 from your Holy Spirit in us.

1247
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:52,500
 And so will you use that power for us?

1248
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,580
 Would you, through us, help us press forward

1249
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,460
 toward our purpose in the place

1250
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,860
 that you have entrusted to us,

1251
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,500
 with the people that you have entrusted to us?

1252
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:08,220
 God, for your holy name, and for your fame,

1253
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:14,260
 and for your honor, and for your glory, in Jesus' name.

1254
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,100
 Amen.

1255
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,260
 (silence)

1256
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,420
 (silence)

1257
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,580
 (silence)

1258
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:31,580
