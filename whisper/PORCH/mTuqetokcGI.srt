1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
 - Hey guys.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,520
 (audience cheering)

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,360
 How's it going?

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,840
 Awaken, it is so good to be here.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,560
 (audience cheering)

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,360
 And I feel like causing trouble today,

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,360
 so somehow I am praying that God will use this evening

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:24,040
 to not just teach you something.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,240
 In fact, I don't care if you learn something new.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,520
 I think you probably know plenty.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,320
 I am praying that the wind of the Spirit

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,880
 would blow in this place,

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,320
 and that there would be people that walk out of here

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,720
 convicted to go onto the mission field,

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,560
 both in their workplace and across the globe.

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,980
 I am praying that there would be conviction in this room,

17
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,680
 that there would be a sense of,

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,480
 you know what, the Spirit rising up in me,

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,980
 and I'm gonna say things that I've never said out loud

20
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,520
 before I leave this place.

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,560
 I'm gonna pray that the Spirit is gonna move you

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,020
 to do things that you never, ever, ever, ever wanted to do,

23
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,720
 because that is how our God moves.

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,160
 And so let me start by reading a little story,

25
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,960
 and a lot of you are probably familiar with this story.

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,960
 But hopefully tonight it will feel fresh to you again.

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,280
 1 Samuel 17.

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,480
 "Saul and the men of Israel were gathered,

29
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,600
 and the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side,

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,320
 and on Israel they stood on the other mountain

31
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,640
 on the other side with a valley between them.

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,980
 And there came out from the camp of Philistine

33
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,720
 a champion named Goliath, who was really, really big.

34
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,480
 He had a bronze helmet on his head

35
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,640
 and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze,

36
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,280
 weighing a whole lot.

37
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,960
 On his legs he wore bronze thingies,

38
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,440
 and a bronze javelin was slung on his back.

39
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,440
 His spear shaft was really big,

40
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,320
 and its iron point weighed 600 shekels.

41
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,800
 His shield-bearer went ahead of him,

42
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,880
 and Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel,

43
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,600
 'Why do you come out and line up for battle?

44
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,560
 Am I not a Philistine,

45
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,000
 and are you not the servants of Saul?

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,600
 Choose a man and have him come down to me.

47
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,880
 If he is able to fight and kill me,

48
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,440
 he will become your subjects.

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,780
 But if I overcome him and kill him,

50
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,640
 you will become our subjects and serve us.'

51
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,460
 So their freedom was on the line.

52
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,400
 The nation of Israel's freedom was on the line,

53
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,160
 and this man, Goliath, is taunting all of God's people.

54
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,520
 Then the Philistine said,

55
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,600
 "This day I defy the armies of Israel."

56
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,240
 In other words, I defy their God.

57
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,000
 On hearing the Philistines' words,

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,880
 Saul and the Israelites were dismayed and terrified.

59
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,120
 Now David was a son of Jesse,

60
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,040
 who was from Bethlehem in Judah.

61
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,320
 Jesse had eight sons,

62
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,920
 and his oldest three sons had followed Saul to the war,

63
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,000
 but David went back and forth from Saul

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,360
 to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem.

65
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,240
 For 40 days, the Philistines came forward

66
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,500
 every morning and evening, and they took their stand.

67
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,600
 Now Jesse said to his son David,

68
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,980
 "Take these 10 loaves of bread for your brothers,

69
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,040
 and hurry to the camp.

70
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,560
 Take along these 10 cheeses to the commander of the unit."

71
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,480
 I just never noticed that before,

72
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,120
 and it wasn't in my storybook Bible,

73
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,560
 but this is full-on charcuterie

74
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,520
 like David is carrying into battle.

75
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,840
 10 cheeses, I mean, that's wild.

76
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,180
 Okay, sorry.

77
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,480
 "See how your brothers are,

78
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,240
 and bring back some assurance from them."

79
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,920
 So he shows up, this is my interpretation.

80
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,480
 So he shows up and sees Goliath

81
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,640
 and all the Israelites cowering and afraid,

82
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,400
 and he is annoying his brothers,

83
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,960
 trying to figure out what is going on.

84
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,820
 And he seems like a pest for a few paragraphs.

85
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,180
 And then David said to Saul,

86
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,700
 "Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine.

87
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,960
 Your servant will go and fight him."

88
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,880
 Okay?

89
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,080
 So David's watching all the armies

90
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,400
 stand around and be dismayed and afraid,

91
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,960
 and he's trying to figure out what's wrong.

92
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,560
 Why, we are God's people.

93
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,600
 Anyway, he's bothered.

94
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,760
 And so he decides, "I'll fight him."

95
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,480
 Saul replied, "You are not able to go against the Philistine

96
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,320
 and fight him.

97
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,440
 You are only a young man,

98
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,000
 and he has been a warrior from his youth."

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,660
 But David said to Saul,

100
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,560
 "Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep.

101
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,140
 When a lion or a bear came

102
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,180
 and carried off a sheep from the flock,

103
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,760
 I went after it, struck it,

104
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,240
 and rescued the sheep from its mouth.

105
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,880
 When it turned on me, I seized it by the hair,

106
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,040
 struck it and killed it.

107
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,520
 Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear.

108
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,200
 This uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them

109
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,680
 because he has defiled the armies of God.

110
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,760
 The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion

111
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,920
 and the paw of the bear will rescue me

112
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,440
 from the hand of this Philistine."

113
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,000
 Don't you love him?

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,840
 Love him.

115
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,660
 Okay.

116
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,280
 Saul said to David, "Go and the Lord be with you."

117
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,560
 Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic.

118
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,680
 He put a coat of armor on him

119
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,340
 and a bronze helmet on his head.

120
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,440
 David fastened on his sword over the tunic

121
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,800
 and tried walking around because he was not used to them.

122
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,440
 He said, "I can't go in these," he said to Saul,

123
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,400
 "because I'm not used to them."

124
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,800
 So he took them off.

125
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,600
 Then he took his staff in his hand,

126
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,960
 chose five smooth stones from the stream,

127
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,320
 put them in his pouch, his little shepherd bag pouch,

128
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,320
 and his sling in his hand, and he approached the Philistine.

129
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,640
 I know y'all have heard this before, but it is so good.

130
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,360
 And then the next paragraph, he gets made fun of

131
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,760
 and ridiculed for a few paragraphs.

132
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,120
 It's significant, but moving on.

133
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,360
 "But David said to the Philistine,

134
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,800
 "You come against me with sword and spear and javelin,

135
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,160
 "but I come against you

136
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,160
 "in the name of the Lord Almighty,

137
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,400
 "the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.

138
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,300
 "This day, the Lord will deliver you into my hands

139
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,680
 "and I will strike you down, cut off your head."

140
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,020
 And then he did that.

141
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,300
 (congregation laughing)

142
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,020
 God, the same God,

143
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,220
 the same God that watched his people

144
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,340
 on the side of the mountain,

145
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,020
 staring at a simple man, a big man, in fear.

146
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:41,180
 I cannot imagine, God, how frustrating that is for you

147
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,180
 to watch your people stand on the sidelines in fear.

148
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,980
 Well, God, you wanna do great things.

149
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,540
 And so, God, I believe, I mean,

150
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,740
 what I see out of this room happening

151
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,180
 is unbelievable works through your spirit

152
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,380
 and for your glory.

153
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,660
 So, God, would you rise those things up in my friends?

154
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,640
 In Jesus' name, amen.

155
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,820
 But first we're gonna gamble.

156
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,060
 So I need to start.

157
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,420
 I need to start by saying, this is my friend, Stephen.

158
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,260
 Everybody say hi to Stephen.

159
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,100
 - Hello.

160
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,500
 - Hi, Stephen.

161
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,180
 So, Stephen, how many times have you gambled in a church?

162
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,020
 - Never.

163
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,860
 - Okay.

164
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,740
 So, Stephen, let me say first of all,

165
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,320
 that I don't believe in gambling.

166
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,580
 - Me neither anymore.

167
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,660
 (congregation laughing)

168
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,180
 - Dangerous. - I've learned my lesson.

169
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,180
 - Don't do it.

170
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,300
 - But I will teach lessons.

171
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,300
 - But I'm not gonna gamble real money today.

172
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,700
 We're just gonna use these tokens that say $5,000 instead.

173
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,380
 So today, this is the analogy we're gonna use.

174
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,740
 And I wanna teach you about the game of roulette.

175
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,260
 And then we're gonna look at David's life

176
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,100
 and the game of roulette.

177
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,500
 We're gonna come up with some facts and some truths

178
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,940
 that we're gonna apply to our lives.

179
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,440
 How many of you know the game of roulette?

180
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,940
 Actually, don't raise your hand.

181
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,340
 (congregation laughing)

182
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,660
 So we're gonna get judged.

183
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,500
 All right.

184
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,780
 So this game right here, in fact,

185
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,220
 I'm gonna ask my son to come up,

186
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,300
 who's one of the volunteers here this weekend.

187
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,940
 Connor Allen, just graduated Texas A&M.

188
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,500
 (congregation cheering)

189
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,700
 So he's gonna gamble, except without money.

190
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,300
 Oh yeah.

191
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,540
 So here's what I know,

192
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,540
 is that there is a reality to this game

193
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,060
 that I've learned on YouTube.

194
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,960
 And Stephen, I'm gonna teach them

195
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,100
 about roulette from YouTube.

196
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,940
 - Please, I would love to learn.

197
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,820
 - And I have a feeling you're about to interrupt me.

198
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,980
 I just am gonna.

199
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,820
 So let me teach you a few bets,

200
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,060
 because they're gonna apply.

201
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,140
 First bet, you can start making a bet.

202
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,860
 You go, good luck.

203
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,860
 The first bet I'm gonna teach you is the outside.

204
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,200
 (congregation laughing)

205
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,740
 - They are the easiest bets on this game.

206
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,580
 - Yes. - Go ahead.

207
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,420
 - They are the easiest bets and the most likely to win,

208
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,820
 because you're really picking between red and black.

209
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,580
 It lands on red, you get--

210
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,260
 - Red. - Double, double your money.

211
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,580
 - Even money.

212
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,980
 - Okay, oh, he's going, okay.

213
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,820
 - One to one.

214
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,520
 - And then you land on black, you get the same thing.

215
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,900
 So this is a 50% chance I'm gonna win.

216
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,100
 - Correct.

217
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,420
 - Then you go into the table a little bit more,

218
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,000
 and then there's some more complicated bets

219
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,160
 that I want you to learn.

220
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,100
 So the first thing is, I know about the corner bet.

221
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,900
 What's the other one called, the split?

222
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,220
 - There's a split bet, 17 to one.

223
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,980
 - Okay, tell us about that.

224
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,980
 - Okay, so seven or the eight hits.

225
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,020
 You know, when you spin the wheel,

226
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,380
 the seven or eight hits, you get 17,

227
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,820
 depending on how much dollars you have left.

228
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,320
 If it's a dollar, it's 17, two dollars is 34, and so on.

229
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,800
 And of course, that's 17 for a split.

230
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,100
 Corners are the four numbers.

231
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,660
 Any one of those four pays eight to one.

232
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,640
 - Eight to one.

233
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,860
 Okay, I want you to take this in.

234
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,880
 Eight to one, four squares, okay?

235
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,840
 What are you gonna do?

236
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,180
 - I just want you to tell people the real reason

237
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,680
 that you know all this about roulette.

238
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,940
 (audience laughing)

239
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,240
 - I've gambled one time.

240
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,620
 I'm about to tell my son this.

241
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,520
 I gambled one time, and I was really good at it,

242
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,960
 but it was just the slots.

243
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,220
 I turned $20 to $200, and then I lost it all,

244
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,560
 and my husband took me out and said,

245
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,620
 "You can never gamble again," because I loved it so much.

246
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,860
 I turned around, and I looked at him, and I said,

247
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,460
 "Why do we not do this all the time when I'm not gonna do it?"

248
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,140
 (audience laughing)

249
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,260
 And he turned white.

250
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,340
 That's the only time I've gambled.

251
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,100
 So I don't know roulette, except for,

252
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,000
 actually, the YouTube channel that taught me this

253
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,780
 was called Totally Depraved.

254
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,480
 Didn't make that up.

255
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,320
 All right.

256
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,140
 - Not a shout out.

257
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,980
 - All right, let's do it.

258
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,820
 Are we ready?

259
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,640
 Let's do it. - Absolutely.

260
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,480
 - Let's go.

261
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,520
 So if it hits on any of the numbers

262
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,320
 that my son has placed a bet on,

263
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,120
 he wins money, but loses money, too?

264
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
 - Absolutely.

265
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,200
 Only one number's gonna hit out of 38 numbers,

266
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,560
 36 plus the two zeros, or the zero and double zero,

267
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,860
 we land on a three.

268
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,560
 - But you, but he had red.

269
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,040
 - Hey, thank goodness we have a couple of thousand on that,

270
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,900
 because everything else lost.

271
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,740
 - Okay.

272
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,840
 - So we would just swipe everything away,

273
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,880
 and we would pay what one?

274
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,220
 Which she won. - Just a little bit.

275
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,920
 - $4,000. - Yes.

276
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,080
 - If you wanna take that kind of risk.

277
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,380
 And there you go. - Very good.

278
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,920
 Very good. - And then we do it again.

279
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
 - All right.

280
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,760
 All right, thank you, Stephen.

281
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,600
 - You take your win,

282
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,800
 split it around however you wanna do it,

283
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,900
 if you wanna try it again,

284
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,360
 or you can go cash it in at the cashier's cage.

285
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,160
 - So you did all right.

286
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,000
 Good job.

287
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 All right, y'all thank Stephen and my son, Connor.

288
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,840
 - Absolutely.

289
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,340
 (congregation applauding)

290
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,980
 - Let me tell you why I am starting

291
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,640
 with these two things today.

292
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,180
 I've been off for three months.

293
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,880
 I have been on a sabbatical.

294
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,880
 And in that time, I enjoyed myself.

295
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,720
 I actually had a lot of fun.

296
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,320
 I have a really, really great family.

297
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,020
 I like them.

298
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,160
 I really like them.

299
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,420
 Like it's not pretend, I think they're really fun.

300
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,160
 And I'm really content living the life

301
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,700
 I've lived the last three months.

302
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,400
 In fact, I'm probably in a lot of ways more content.

303
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,000
 But I'm supposed to come back.

304
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,540
 And the reason I'm supposed to come back at least today,

305
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,280
 who knows, tomorrow might be a different story.

306
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,280
 But today, why I'm here and not at home

307
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,180
 is because I actually really believe in you.

308
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:36,360
 And I actually really believe what David shared last night,

309
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,400
 that the time is short and that we don't have long.

310
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,340
 And when I picture your lives,

311
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,340
 and I picture over 3,000 of you going into your places

312
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,380
 and obeying God, something rises up in me

313
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,520
 that says, I don't want to choose comfort.

314
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,560
 I want to choose obedience.

315
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,260
 And so what we're gonna talk about tonight is risk.

316
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,360
 Because in my experience,

317
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,300
 following God has typically been risky.

318
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,600
 In fact, not very much time goes by

319
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,540
 that he's not calling me to risk in some way.

320
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:27,380
 And the reason that I picked this topic as I'm coming back

321
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,120
 is that I actually believe

322
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,480
 that good works were prepared in advance.

323
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,980
 Ephesians says that good works were prepared

324
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,320
 in advance for you to do.

325
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,420
 That there are things that God has written into your story,

326
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,860
 gifted you for, like David shared,

327
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,260
 and prepared you for to accomplish

328
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,060
 that will change the kingdom of God.

329
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,140
 Godly, obedient risk.

330
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,740
 But I'm gonna speak widely to your generation,

331
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,980
 meaning I'm gonna say people in their 20s, early 30s,

332
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,080
 I think you're playing very small.

333
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:11,060
 I think you're playing very small.

334
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,520
 And that would be okay if there wasn't much on the line,

335
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,020
 but guys, we don't know that there isn't a lot on the line.

336
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,720
 In fact, just biblically speaking,

337
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,200
 even if Jesus doesn't return for generations,

338
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,740
 there's always a lot on the line, right?

339
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,640
 And so what I wanna start with tonight

340
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,340
 before we get into this,

341
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,200
 I want you to envision something

342
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,940
 that you have felt God prompt you to do,

343
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,280
 that you have imagined that should be done on the earth,

344
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,580
 something that feels kind of audacious,

345
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,180
 that, or maybe it's just scary.

346
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,480
 In fact, let me define risk for you,

347
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,660
 'cause this helped me a lot.

348
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,860
 This is just out of the dictionary right here, ready?

349
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,160
 An action exposing you to danger, harm, or loss.

350
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,160
 An action exposing you to danger, harm, or loss.

351
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:09,160
 So what is God calling you to do?

352
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,840
 Or maybe it's as simple right now, today,

353
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,000
 as just what do you think should be done?

354
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,720
 And I want you to come up with something in your mind,

355
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,340
 because this is a part of teaching

356
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,520
 where a right typical response in my preparation

357
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,060
 would be to name a lot of different options for you,

358
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,220
 to say, "Hey, I could picture it being this,"

359
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,120
 or, "I could picture it being this."

360
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,960
 But I really felt hesitant to do that,

361
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,900
 because I actually think God is way more creative than me.

362
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,300
 And I believe that he will bring something into your mind

363
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,300
 that I would never have thought of or imagined,

364
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,480
 because that's how he works.

365
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,680
 That's how he works.

366
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,320
 And so this is what I wanna do first.

367
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,120
 I want you just to say that out loud.

368
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,120
 Maybe it's not something you're going to do,

369
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,160
 but it's something you think should be done.

370
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,260
 Can we start there?

371
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,760
 Something in your generation.

372
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,860
 Now, I'm gonna add one more little part to it.

373
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,780
 I want you to imagine that Jesus is coming back in 10 years.

374
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,600
 What would you do?

375
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,820
 What would you do if you knew 10 years from today,

376
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,880
 Jesus was coming back?

377
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,020
 What would need to be done and what risk would you take?

378
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,920
 And I want you to tell your neighbor, go.

379
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,580
 (water rushing)

380
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,240
 (water rushing)

381
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,900
 (water rushing)

382
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,560
 (water rushing)

383
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,220
 (water rushing)

384
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,880
 (water rushing)

385
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,180
 (water rushing)

386
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:16,880
 (water rushing)

387
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,540
 (water rushing)

388
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:25,780
 Okay, yell some things out.

389
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:31,180
 (congregation shouting)

390
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:40,960
 Foster children.

391
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,160
 Sex trafficking.

392
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,920
 (congregation shouting)

393
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,960
 Become a pastor.

394
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,180
 Okay.

395
00:17:50,180 --> 00:18:00,460
 I love it.

396
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:10,500
 (congregation applauding)

397
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,600
 (laughing)

398
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,660
 Yeah, I'm feeling like this is going downhill fast.

399
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,000
 (congregation laughing)

400
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,840
 Okay.

401
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,100
 I believe there are good works that God prepared you to do

402
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,900
 and I believe that we can miss them.

403
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,140
 I believe it is possible to waste your life.

404
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,480
 I believe that we play small because we forget that.

405
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,460
 So the corner bet.

406
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,860
 I like the corner bet.

407
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,460
 It's kind of in the middle.

408
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,620
 One to eight odds.

409
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,080
 You are unlikely to get this.

410
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,420
 In fact, Stephen was telling me out there, he goes,

411
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,920
 this is the worst game in the whole casino.

412
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,420
 Never play roulette.

413
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,380
 The odds are never in your favor.

414
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,020
 Look how many numbers there are.

415
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,780
 But the corner bet, you're saying one, four, five, or two.

416
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,580
 Guys, let me tell you something.

417
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,160
 Every single one of you is placing a bet in this life.

418
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,480
 You are placing a bet.

419
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,420
 You may not realize that you're placing a bet.

420
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,320
 You're not thinking about it, but you're placing a bet.

421
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,020
 Let's start with red and black.

422
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,480
 That's the most careless thing you can do.

423
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,520
 You have a good chance of winning.

424
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,380
 That's the one my son won.

425
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,720
 Red or black, 50/50, you're only gonna double your money.

426
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:37,020
 But a lot of you in life aren't even thinking about this.

427
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,920
 You've casually tossed a chip in with God

428
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,860
 or a chip in with the world.

429
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,220
 You like that, Jesus, the world?

430
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,420
 So good, black, red.

431
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,460
 Plays out so great.

432
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,020
 Gotta redeem it somehow, y'all.

433
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,020
 You casually do that.

434
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,320
 You're not overthinking it.

435
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,460
 You barely even think about what you're doing

436
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,580
 or why you're doing it.

437
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,180
 I think that is a lot of us.

438
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,560
 Corner bet.

439
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,620
 One, two, four, five.

440
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,380
 This one is a little more strategic.

441
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,780
 In fact, probably most of the girls in here

442
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,580
 will relate more to this than the other one.

443
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,580
 This one, you're planning it out.

444
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,160
 But you're gonna put your chips on a few things.

445
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,620
 You're gonna say, you know what?

446
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,720
 I do think Jesus is real, yes.

447
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,420
 But I also wanna get married, yes.

448
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,780
 And I also would like a cute dog.

449
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,980
 And I want a good job.

450
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,620
 And I wanna make enough money that I can shop.

451
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,860
 (congregation laughing)

452
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,780
 And that's okay.

453
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,620
 It's okay.

454
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,760
 None of that's bad.

455
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,760
 But there's definitely a assessment of risk.

456
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:52,720
 If I go all in here, then I may not get this.

457
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,960
 And I may not get this.

458
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,320
 And I may not get this.

459
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,160
 Every one of you is putting your hope, your money,

460
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,460
 your time, your passions, your curiosity,

461
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,760
 all of you are putting your money somewhere.

462
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,160
 You're putting it somewhere.

463
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,320
 And how divided it is, it's interesting,

464
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,460
 the lower the payout.

465
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:26,120
 So if I put it on a row, Stephen's in the back going,

466
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,500
 don't do it, Jenny, you're gonna mess it up.

467
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,960
 If I put it on a row, if I put it on a section,

468
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,200
 this section right here, then I have the odds go way down.

469
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,100
 But if I get anything in this,

470
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,520
 and that's what we do is we spread it out so far

471
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,000
 so that hopefully something works out for us.

472
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,200
 Seek ye first the kingdom of God

473
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,400
 and all these things will be added to you.

474
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,600
 And yet we are trying to get all these things

475
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,500
 and adding God to that.

476
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,920
 Next, small risks lead to big risks.

477
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:07,560
 Small risks lead to big risks.

478
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,860
 Okay, let's look at David.

479
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:15,020
 Do you think most shepherds today or even back then

480
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,160
 have stories like there was a lion and there was a bear?

481
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,680
 Do you think that that was common?

482
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,820
 I don't think that was common.

483
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,320
 I'm like, dude's sitting with a harp in the field

484
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,160
 watching sheep.

485
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,860
 I don't think bears and lions were like all over the place,

486
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,860
 but God sent David a bear and God sent David a lion.

487
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,940
 Why?

488
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,720
 Because he knew there would be a Goliath.

489
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:48,700
 See the way risk works is it rarely is that God

490
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,820
 is gonna ask you to move to China

491
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,620
 and be a part of the underground church.

492
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,380
 That's not how it usually works.

493
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,320
 What happens is he will ask you to serve in the nursery.

494
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,600
 Like he will put something in your spirit that says,

495
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,440
 you know what?

496
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,500
 I think I'm supposed to sign up to lead Sunday school.

497
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,760
 One of my son's best friends,

498
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,220
 I sat by him in church the other day

499
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,780
 and he had to dart out really quickly and he leaned over.

500
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,100
 He was like, I've got to go.

501
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,340
 My kids are waiting for me.

502
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,260
 And he's leading five-year-olds in church.

503
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,540
 He's 25, 26 years old and they love him.

504
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,780
 His name's Grady.

505
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,780
 And he was like, but Mrs. Allen, I love them more.

506
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,100
 He said, I don't want them to graduate.

507
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,140
 And this is the week that they're gonna go up

508
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,020
 and I'm so devastated that I'm not going with them.

509
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,020
 Sometimes that risk, and he said,

510
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,160
 I don't know why I did it.

511
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,460
 I just felt like I was supposed to get more involved.

512
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,460
 I was supposed to serve.

513
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,860
 Like, I could, I should.

514
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,380
 It was just a little bitty risk.

515
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,060
 But here's the thing about risks.

516
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,940
 When I took my kids cliff jumping, they're terrified.

517
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,820
 They're going off a cliff this big.

518
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,800
 They're terrified till they do it once.

519
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,680
 And then guess what?

520
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,500
 They're looking at the next higher cliff

521
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,300
 and they're like, let's go, let's go on the higher one.

522
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,420
 And then they're jumping off of that.

523
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,820
 And before long, I'm weeping in the fetal position

524
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,180
 because they're jumping off of a 10-story building

525
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,100
 into the water.

526
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,180
 My offspring, right?

527
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,260
 That's how it goes.

528
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:21,220
 Gets bigger and bigger because we get conditioned.

529
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:26,540
 We realize that if we jump off that cliff, that we're okay.

530
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,020
 Not only are we okay, but this is fun.

531
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,820
 And this is what we were built for.

532
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,680
 That's how God works.

533
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,580
 This isn't some scary thing

534
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,220
 that he's calling you into drudgery.

535
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,900
 He is actually calling you into the abundant life

536
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,260
 that you're missing if you don't live this way.

537
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,640
 Obedient, risk, fast tracks, growth.

538
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,400
 Now, I know this morning TA talked about,

539
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,760
 he talked a little bit about sin.

540
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,480
 And he talked about our bodies and what they were made for.

541
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,080
 And some of you have struggled

542
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,920
 with the same sin for a decade.

543
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,520
 And you don't know how to change.

544
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,480
 And you don't know why things aren't changing.

545
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,080
 Some of you have been looking for purpose in your life

546
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,400
 since you were 12 years old,

547
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,200
 and you still don't know what it is.

548
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,480
 Risk, fast tracks, growth.

549
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,960
 It causes you to actually want God because you need God.

550
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,800
 When you're standing there going,

551
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,920
 "I'm scared and I don't know how to do this.

552
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,600
 "And I feel empty and I don't know if this is gonna work.

553
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,520
 "And I don't know if this risk

554
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,320
 "is actually gonna prove worth it."

555
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,400
 I have been there so many times.

556
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,880
 And guys, I'm on my knees and my favorite two words,

557
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,080
 I prayed it yesterday and put it on Instagram,

558
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,600
 is help God, help God, help God.

559
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,480
 And guess what?

560
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,320
 When you are saying help God, what does that look like?

561
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,840
 You are fixing your eyes on Jesus.

562
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,880
 You are running the race that was set before you.

563
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,400
 And it says that the sin and the burden

564
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,240
 that so easily entangles you starts to fall off.

565
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,040
 That's Hebrews 12.

566
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,600
 It starts to fall off.

567
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,440
 Why?

568
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,560
 Because you're so busy running,

569
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,760
 you don't have time to think about yourself.

570
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,080
 Like this is how the Christian life is meant to be run

571
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,480
 in abundance, that we would not be hedging our bets

572
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,960
 and trying to control our lives and figure it out.

573
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,760
 We are fixing our eyes on Jesus,

574
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,680
 running the race he has set before us,

575
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,920
 and throwing off the sin and the burden

576
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,840
 because why would we carry that around

577
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,680
 when we've got a race to run?

578
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,320
 If you're wondering why you're still stuck in a sin

579
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,600
 10 years later, go sign up to lead five-year-olds

580
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,920
 or do something that will change your life

581
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,200
 and make you less selfish.

582
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,640
 Care about someone other than yourself.

583
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,360
 And all of a sudden you don't have time to sin

584
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,720
 because you're thinking about the people

585
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,800
 that are looking up to you.

586
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,960
 You're thinking about the people

587
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,400
 that wanna be just like you.

588
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,600
 And there's something in the spirit

589
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,320
 that happens through us and to us.

590
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,960
 When we say, okay, I'll try that, I'll do that,

591
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,200
 that's not comfortable for me.

592
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,960
 Help God, help.

593
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:26,320
 This is what I know.

594
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:34,180
 Every single thing that I know to be true of God

595
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:38,080
 is not because I was blessed enough to get to go to seminary

596
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,640
 and because I know my Bible.

597
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,080
 Everything that I know to be true of God

598
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,420
 is because I have stepped out on the water

599
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,900
 where feet may fail and He has held.

600
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,320
 And that is what the life is He has called you to.

601
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,800
 Now, some of you are sitting there thinking, this is great.

602
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:01,680
 I'll risk, I don't think it's that big a deal.

603
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,080
 What do you want me to do?

604
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,560
 And I'll do it.

605
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,560
 I'm gonna suggest that probably the thing you want to do

606
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,200
 is probably not the thing God's gonna call you to do.

607
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,680
 So I'm actually gonna take this great sales pitch

608
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,680
 and like kill it because in my experience,

609
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:28,440
 He keeps, I keep saying,

610
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,760
 I keep saying I wanna go that way.

611
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,400
 And He keeps saying, you're going this way.

612
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,240
 And because of that, I am at Him.

613
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:51,720
 But where else am I gonna go?

614
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:59,280
 This is the Christian life,

615
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,280
 not finding your perfect career and calling,

616
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,120
 but finding ways to die to yourself every single day

617
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,600
 and pick up your cross and follow Him

618
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,760
 no matter where He says go.

619
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,160
 And that is the story of how you know Jesus if you do,

620
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,760
 because somebody picked up their cross and followed Jesus

621
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,040
 and said, I'm gonna tell this neighbor about God.

622
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,840
 I'm gonna go to a new city.

623
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,880
 I am going to go to a new country.

624
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,160
 I am going to take the gospel somewhere

625
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,640
 because someone said, I'll go where I don't wanna go.

626
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,840
 You know Jesus.

627
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,560
 Because somebody had a conversation

628
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,800
 that they didn't probably want to have, you know Jesus.

629
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,960
 It is down this road that is more unknown.

630
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,160
 It's wilderness.

631
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,480
 It's like, let me tell you how I've felt

632
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,560
 most of my Christian life.

633
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,800
 I have a hatchet, I'm in the jungle and God says go.

634
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,080
 And I'm like, there's no road.

635
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,240
 He's like, go.

636
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
 I'm like, you want me just to start chopping?

637
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,400
 And He's like, yes, chop and I'll be right with you.

638
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,800
 And I'll tell you when to go left

639
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,120
 and I'll tell you when to go right.

640
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,480
 And you'll know what to do, not because you're smart,

641
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,640
 but because I'm good and I'll walk right beside you.

642
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,200
 I will be a lamp unto your feet.

643
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,440
 I will show you.

644
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,040
 I will show you where to go.

645
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,880
 And what does that look like?

646
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,240
 Everybody's going, what does that look like?

647
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,440
 Does God speak?

648
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,760
 I know, everybody wants to know.

649
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,360
 That's like the trick question

650
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,240
 or I'm gonna get in trouble now on the internet.

651
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,080
 All right.

652
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:42,960
 I can't tell you, but when I stand in front of choices,

653
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,320
 there's a sense of surrender in me

654
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,520
 that I will go wherever you call me to go.

655
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,600
 And when that has been true of my heart,

656
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,760
 not just of my mouth, but of my heart,

657
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,920
 I've known what to do.

658
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,120
 Surrender always, always is necessary to hear from God.

659
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:10,280
 You will never ever know what to do in your life

660
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,880
 as long as you are placing bets on six numbers,

661
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,600
 eight numbers, four numbers,

662
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,360
 until you place everything into one square.

663
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,960
 You will always feel like, why don't I hear from God?

664
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,400
 Why do I struggle with my sin?

665
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,600
 Why can't I change?

666
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,560
 You will be stuck in your sin forever.

667
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,360
 It's the simplest, truest thing I could ever say on earth.

668
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,240
 Surrender to Jesus, all of it.

669
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,760
 Seek ye first the kingdom of God

670
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,120
 and all these other things will be added to you.

671
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,840
 It's a story of the whole book that we read

672
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,120
 and that we preach about.

673
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:54,920
 Abraham, all of the history of all of those imperfect people

674
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,060
 that said, God, yes, Esther, I will obey you.

675
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:04,740
 And then this one, and this one isn't fun.

676
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,560
 Risk will always confuse the people around you.

677
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:14,460
 Can you imagine what everyone was thinking about David

678
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,180
 when he takes off all the armor

679
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,060
 and runs out with his little slingshot?

680
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,220
 Can you imagine how much everyone was just laughing

681
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,560
 and entertained by this?

682
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,040
 This was hysterical to them.

683
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,240
 They were making fun of him.

684
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,740
 The Philistines, everybody's taunting him.

685
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,780
 They're not even fighting

686
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,460
 because they're literally just having a ball

687
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,560
 watching this little boy with a slingshot.

688
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:40,880
 And yet the world has a way of doing things

689
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,620
 that is successful.

690
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,140
 It makes sense to the world.

691
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,460
 It makes sense to us.

692
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,540
 It makes sense, this is how you do it.

693
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,780
 This is what you do.

694
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:53,780
 But when God calls you to risk something,

695
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,460
 to do something for him,

696
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:00,460
 in my experience, it has never made any sense at all.

697
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,740
 It has never felt like, wow, I have what I need.

698
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,280
 I know what to do, let's go.

699
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,060
 It has felt like, are you sure?

700
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,060
 Because this is gonna be embarrassing.

701
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,420
 This feels scary.

702
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,080
 I don't think that this could possibly be right.

703
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,060
 I remember when we started If Gathering,

704
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,220
 it's an organization I lead,

705
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,020
 and we hosted our first big event.

706
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,460
 And I took away the ticket price,

707
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,580
 and I said, I think we're supposed to do pay what you can.

708
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,380
 We didn't have an investor.

709
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,660
 We didn't have any money ourselves.

710
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,500
 We had nothing.

711
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,040
 And so my husband and everyone that loves me

712
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,060
 and everyone that was involved was like, Jenny, no.

713
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,980
 Like, we will have to file bankruptcy,

714
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,380
 and this will end before you even start.

715
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,380
 And guys, there are times to listen

716
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,780
 to the voices of godly people.

717
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,740
 Believe me, I have listened to my husband

718
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,300
 many, many times that he has said no,

719
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,260
 and I've said, you're probably right.

720
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:59,160
 But in this instant, there was something in me

721
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,020
 that I just knew this is what we were supposed to do,

722
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,620
 and it didn't make sense.

723
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,460
 It cost $300,000 to host our first event.

724
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,500
 It went out to the world.

725
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,500
 There were 1,200 local events that happened in that time.

726
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,020
 We raised $315,000

727
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,140
 with $10 bets.

728
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,100
 I mean, not bets, donations.

729
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,580
 (congregation laughing)

730
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,420
 Kinda was.

731
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,500
 $10 donations.

732
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:32,020
 There are times God will ask you to do something

733
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,020
 that feels just silly.

734
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,540
 And largely, let me tell you where that has been in my life.

735
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,100
 It has been in my neighborhood.

736
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,580
 It has been with my friends.

737
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,180
 It has been with people that I have a relationship with.

738
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,980
 Those have been scarier risks than the big things.

739
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,700
 Having a conversation with somebody

740
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,140
 that doesn't know God,

741
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,260
 that has been a harder thing to accomplish

742
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,100
 than the big things that I'm more sure of

743
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,620
 that I feel like God is really saying to me,

744
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,420
 even though there's more on the line.

745
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:04,020
 But here's what I picture with all of you,

746
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:08,780
 is if we're growing up, if we're running our race,

747
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,820
 if we're accomplishing what God has for us,

748
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,820
 if we're taking our little rocks and slingshots,

749
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,260
 here's what happens.

750
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,020
 God gets the glory.

751
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,620
 And that's the story that he's writing.

752
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,500
 That's a story he wants to be a part of,

753
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,100
 is a story where he gets the glory,

754
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,540
 where a little boy takes five stones

755
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,340
 and it only takes one and knocks down the giant.

756
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,700
 These are the stories that God wants to build through us.

757
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:38,620
 And what if, what if Jesus comes back in your lifetime?

758
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:45,220
 What if that is the plan?

759
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,220
 And so today, when I'm, specifically yesterday,

760
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,980
 when I'm a little anxious about coming back and going,

761
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,660
 "Okay, Lord, like you're gonna have to almost recall me,

762
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,900
 "recommission me to do this,

763
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,720
 "because I've really liked living in this little space.

764
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,360
 "Like I want you to send me back out

765
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,020
 "if you want me back out there, but I'm good if I stay."

766
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:15,080
 When I'm praying that, when I'm wrestling with him,

767
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,100
 this is what I picture.

768
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,140
 I picture 3,000 of you walking out of these doors

769
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,700
 and doing one small thing that scares the crud out of you

770
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,300
 for the gospel of Jesus Christ.

771
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:32,100
 And that that domino falls into the lives of other people

772
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,240
 and it hits their lives and you don't ever know

773
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,020
 or even see it, but you obeyed God.

774
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,060
 You obeyed God and you did what he called you to do.

775
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,980
 And that fell into the life of someone else.

776
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,560
 And that fell into the life of more people.

777
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,300
 And that fell into the life of more people.

778
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,180
 And that fell into the life of more people.

779
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,660
 All of a sudden, I'm not speaking to 3,000 people.

780
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,680
 I'm speaking to hundreds of thousands of people

781
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,260
 because you walk out those doors, you go to your towns

782
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,220
 and you do the little acts of obedience

783
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,280
 that scare you to death.

784
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,980
 God moves on earth.

785
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:06,020
 How the world changes.

786
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,220
 Small, risky, godly steps of obedience.

787
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,020
 If you are following him and it feels comfortable,

788
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,480
 I promise you there is more.

789
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,580
 And here's the great news.

790
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:26,040
 God honoring risky obedience,

791
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,900
 it isn't actually risky at all.

792
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,780
 It's not risky at all.

793
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,380
 The way that this game is played, Stephen was telling me,

794
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:37,460
 is that the most common bet is to put it all on a number.

795
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,400
 You put it on one number.

796
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,780
 20 is the most popular number.

797
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,980
 So here's hundreds of thousands of dollars.

798
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,900
 We're gonna just put it all on 20.

799
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,980
 Because here's the thing.

800
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,460
 We know how this ends.

801
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,280
 If you knew the number, if you knew it, without a doubt,

802
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,200
 if you knew the number is 20, I know it,

803
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,580
 it is going to be 20, what would you put in on that?

804
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,420
 What would you do?

805
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,940
 How would you play if you were certain

806
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,960
 with 100% accuracy that the number would be 20

807
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,180
 when this thing rolls, what would you do?

808
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,860
 What would you put in on it?

809
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,920
 You'd put everything.

810
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,300
 Guys, you're playing small and there's something in me

811
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,340
 that has this feeling like it's gonna really matter

812
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,720
 that you not do that.

813
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,940
 That it's going to matter that you spend your lives

814
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:37,500
 not fancy, not doing big things for God,

815
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,140
 but doing obedient things that God calls you to.

816
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,340
 And sometimes it will be big and mostly it will be small,

817
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,940
 but it will be big.

818
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:51,340
 Because when I look at the things God has done

819
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,620
 that in the world's eyes are big,

820
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,420
 they were built with a million small little relationships

821
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:01,140
 and conversations and scary moments and acts of obedience.

822
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,800
 And for most of you and most of us,

823
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,260
 we're not gonna see till heaven

824
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,460
 how all of that was the big stuff, but it is the big stuff.

825
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,960
 It is the big stuff.

826
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:19,020
 The most common way God has led me and nudged me

827
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:25,420
 is ideas that pop in my head that I wouldn't have thought of

828
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:29,360
 that I'd be too selfish to even think of that.

829
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,860
 But they'll bother me, they'll be in my head

830
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,860
 and I'll think to myself, okay,

831
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,540
 maybe that matters, maybe that's something

832
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,900
 I'm supposed to do.

833
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,060
 And I've learned to listen to those ideas and those thoughts

834
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,340
 and to act on them because what's happened

835
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,700
 when I've done that is ridiculous things.

836
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,420
 It's like the little rocks, you're like,

837
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,220
 this isn't a big deal, it's just a little rock.

838
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,620
 It's what I do when I'm taking care of the sheep.

839
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,820
 But he set his nation free.

840
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:04,140
 So who are we to decide what we should do for God?

841
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:09,060
 See, God has a plan, he has a story,

842
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,700
 it's written before time and prepared in advance

843
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,880
 for us to walk in.

844
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:19,500
 I think of the parable about the field

845
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:25,500
 when Jesus is giving the analogy of

846
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,140
 who wouldn't buy the field, push all the money in

847
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,340
 when they see that there's a treasure

848
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,800
 worth more than the land.

849
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,340
 They spend whatever they have to spend to get the land

850
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,100
 and everybody will say, you're crazy to pay that,

851
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,720
 to spend that, to risk that, to lose that,

852
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,860
 to not control that, to go all in with God,

853
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,780
 that feels crazy.

854
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,860
 You may never get married

855
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,860
 because you're too strong of a girl.

856
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:54,240
 You may never have the perfect life

857
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,380
 that you're trying to build.

858
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,320
 You may lose that if you're called overseas.

859
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,760
 Think of my friend, Katie Davis.

860
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,100
 Many of you know her story.

861
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:08,140
 And she moved overseas as a 20 year old

862
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,260
 and just never came back.

863
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,860
 She moved to Uganda and started bringing girls in

864
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,680
 off the streets and loving them and they became a family.

865
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,260
 And the story of Katie is what inspired

866
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,220
 every single thing that I am currently doing in my life,

867
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:28,220
 namely our family, adoption,

868
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,900
 gift gathering, getting over myself

869
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,340
 and doing what he's called me to do

870
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,580
 and going down the road he's called me to go on

871
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,820
 instead of the road that I would want to

872
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,520
 or that would be more comfortable.

873
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:46,820
 See, risk is contagious.

874
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:52,380
 Because you do things, you start doing things

875
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,740
 that don't make sense, that aren't comfortable.

876
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:59,060
 And everybody cocks their head and wonders

877
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,540
 what the heck you're doing.

878
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:05,140
 But deep down, we all really hope there's more to live for

879
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:09,460
 than just a perfect little life that's all figured out.

880
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,900
 And there is.

881
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,460
 There is.

882
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,900
 We're not crazy.

883
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,300
 We're not crazy.

884
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,100
 The number's 20, I don't know.

885
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,080
 The number's 20.

886
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,780
 Whatever it is, it's happening, it's real, it's not myth.

887
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,900
 Heaven's coming.

888
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,940
 It's not pretend.

889
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,980
 It's not a Maple Leaf story you heard in sixth grade.

890
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,500
 It's real, it's happening, it's coming.

891
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,860
 And anything and everything that we do

892
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,700
 in the name of our God and in light of that story

893
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,820
 will be worth it.

894
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,540
 We are not fools.

895
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,460
 So what is it?

896
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,040
 And let me tell you what we're gonna do.

897
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,900
 We're gonna actually pray really quickly together.

898
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:00,460
 And we're gonna ask God together if you're up for this.

899
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,940
 And I would encourage you, even if you're not,

900
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:08,540
 to pray these two simple prayers.

901
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,900
 They're gonna play for just a minute.

902
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,300
 Number one, you're gonna say,

903
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,400
 "God, what do you want me to know?

904
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,080
 "What do you want me to know?"

905
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:22,800
 And then number two, "God, what do you want me to do?"

906
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,560
 And we're just gonna be quiet for a minute.

907
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,720
 And as you ask God those questions,

908
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,360
 I am praying that he will bring ideas to your mind.

909
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,320
 So God, we are your people and we are here.

910
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,460
 And we wanna spend our lives well.

911
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,680
 Show us how.

912
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,960
 God, what do you want us to know?

913
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,480
 And what do you want us to do?

914
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,060
 (gentle music)

915
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,640
 (gentle music)

916
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,220
 (gentle music)

917
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,800
 (gentle music)

918
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,380
 (gentle music)

919
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,960
 (gentle music)

920
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,540
 (gentle music)

921
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,120
 (gentle music)

922
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,700
 (gentle music)

923
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:16,280
 (gentle music)

924
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:21,360
 (gentle music)

925
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,820
 (gentle music)

926
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:30,280
 (gentle music)

927
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,860
 (gentle music)

928
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,440
 (gentle music)

929
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,900
 (gentle music)

930
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,940
 (gentle music)

931
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,940
 (gentle music)

932
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:55,980
 (gentle music)

933
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,980
 (gentle music)

934
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:03,980
 (gentle music)

935
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,980
 (gentle music)

936
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:18,360
 We have maybe a year, maybe 50 more, maybe more,

937
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:24,520
 years on this earth.

938
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:32,860
 And I always have this image in my mind

939
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:36,440
 of getting to heaven and seeing Jesus

940
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,900
 and being out of breath.

941
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,640
 Just having run every ounce of the life

942
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,860
 that he had planned for me.

943
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,860
 And Father, I pray for every person

944
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,400
 that can hear my voice right now, God,

945
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,560
 that they would want the same thing.

946
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,400
 That they would want you more than their life to work out.

947
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:01,320
 That they would want you more than money or fame or success.

948
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,700
 Or success or comfort or power or relationships on earth.

949
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,520
 God, that they would want you most.

950
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,440
 And God, that you would, through their lives,

951
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,280
 write stories that go on into eternity.

952
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,100
 That you would, through these little ideas

953
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,320
 and seeds of thoughts, God, would you multiply them.

954
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:32,940
 And would that ripple, God, touch generations.

955
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:37,320
 And Jesus, we don't know when you're coming back,

956
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,640
 but if it is soon, help us not waste the time.

957
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,900
 God, build an urgency in our souls

958
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:49,180
 that causes us to risk everything in this life for you.

959
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,520
 No matter what you say, God, that we would do it.

960
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,100
 Help us not miss any good work

961
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,140
 that you have prepared in advance for us to do.

962
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:08,360
 Not for our glory ever, because what a waste,

963
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,440
 but for your name and your glory that will go on forever.

964
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,760
 We wanna be a part of that.

965
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,020
 In Jesus' name, amen.

966
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,080
 you
