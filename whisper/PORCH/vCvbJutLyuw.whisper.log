[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:30.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.400]   Hey, brothers and sisters.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.400]   Welcome to the porch in Dallas, Texas.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.760]   So good to be with you all and also joining us live,
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.240]   Porch Live locations in greater Lafayette
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.560]   and Indianapolis, Indiana.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.840]   I don't know what happened to lesser Lafayette, but no shade.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.160]   Then we've got Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.080]   And with us for the first time this year,
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.560]   Porch Live Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.080]   Welcome.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.720]   So good to be with you all.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.440]   So a couple of weeks ago, I shared
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.520]   that I'm a recovered alcoholic.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.800]   And when I drank, I smoked.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.680]   Like, that went hand in hand.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.120]   Show of hands if you love smoking.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.360]   Just kidding.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.960]   We'll get there.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.560]   But I saw-- you're like, yeah, actually.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.320]   Me too.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.160]   Like, whenever I drank, I smoked.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.440]   It was like-- it was something I loved.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.560]   And so I would like--
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.000]   I guess it probably started like in the eighth grade.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.720]   If you've never smoked, and you're like,
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.160]   why is he hitting them?
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160]   You don't know.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.680]   But you're about to.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.320]   Yeah, in the eighth grade, like, started smoking.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.720]   And then we'd go out in Austin.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.680]   And just after a few drinks, like, smoking just
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.880]   sounded nice.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.360]   Stressful day at work, smoking sounded nice.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.280]   It was like-- it's just a thing that I enjoyed.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.000]   And I'm not looking to create a stumbling block for anybody,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.200]   but there was like some satisfaction to it.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.080]   It's like I knew that it would give me
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.760]   a little bit of relaxation and rest to, like, decompress some,
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.320]   get to be outside.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.360]   It was like-- even though I knew, I mean,
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.400]   Surgeon General warning.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.120]   I mean, it's right there.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.320]   What does this one say?
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.280]   Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.900]   to your health.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.880]   You know, I knew that it caused cancer.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.800]   But it didn't really matter much to me,
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.320]   because it was kind of satisfying.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.000]   So here it was.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   See, I got a nice pack on that one.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.400]   I haven't lost it.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.160]   I haven't had a cigarette in 17 years.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.880]   But--
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:53.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.560]   I wish we could show your face to everyone.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.760]   She's like--
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.480]   But frozen.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.960]   Because it was nice.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.520]   It was like--
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.880]   Oh, if you're-- so I was like, oh my goodness, he really is.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.320]   If you're a smoker, you know that I didn't inhale.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.560]   You know, the smoke looks different when it comes out
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.800]   of your mouth when you inhale.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.280]   Just for technicality purposes, I'm not inhaling it
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.720]   like I'm Bill Clinton, like, I didn't get high.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.760]   Like, sure you didn't, Bill.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.840]   But even just like tasting it, it's like, this is nice.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.960]   Some of you are like, I've seen people pull out their phones,
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.120]   take picture or video.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.720]   It's OK.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.400]   Go ahead, man.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.900]   Go ahead.
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.980]   Here.
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.640]   Here, you go.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.840]   You do you, man.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.920]   You do you.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.040]   What's up?
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.640]   I'll tag you.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.160]   You're pulling out your phones and taking pictures
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.440]   because you're like, what is going on?
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.440]   Someone's smoking.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.800]   But like, surely-- I mean, you've seen someone smoke
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.120]   before, right?
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.760]   Mr. Cameraman over there?
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.920]   Unofficial camera guy?
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.880]   Yeah, you've seen someone smoke before, right?
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.920]   So why are you--
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.340]   like, why are you taking a picture?
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.180]   Why are you filming?
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.720]   Because you're like, it's in church.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.360]   That's why.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.000]   Like, we've seen people smoke, but not in church.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.840]   Like, oh, that's new.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.680]   Wow.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.520]   Why you're smoking in church?
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.200]   That's crazy.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:45.480]   What is exponentially crazier is unforgiveness in church.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.000]   Like, you think that's crazy?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.400]   You pull out your phone for that?
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.240]   Like, oh, man, I'm going to blast this guy.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.600]   He's about to get fired.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.240]   Like, you can't do that in here.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.080]   Why?
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.240]   Seeing people smoke out there, it's
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.600]   because I was smoking in church.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.160]   To have unforgiveness here in the church
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.920]   is exponentially and eternally crazier than smoking in church.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.120]   But here we are, the forgiven ones.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.840]   Of all the 8 billion people walking this earth,
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.080]   we have been forgiven by Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.160]   And here we go, walking in here, singing our songs
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.440]   to the Lord who's forgiven us, while we harbor unforgiveness
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.040]   in our hearts towards somebody who hurt us.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.000]   That's messed up.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.760]   And we need to like flip the camera around and be like,
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.520]   oh, it's me.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.160]   Like, I'm the ridiculous one.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.680]   I'm the one I should be videoing.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.800]   The audacity in church to have unforgiveness,
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.640]   it's the most contrary thing to the gospel,
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.360]   the good news of Jesus Christ, that we've been forgiven.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.840]   And so like smoking, and the reason why it's like--
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.680]   there is a reason why I don't do it anymore.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.960]   Though it was satisfying to me, it was killing me, right?
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.120]   Like, it's causing cancer to me.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.240]   I always thought, like, what are the odds?
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.760]   Like, I'm going to die of something,
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.080]   but I doubt it's going to be smoking.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.160]   And so I'm like, I'll just--
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.040]   I'll roll the dice on that one.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.600]   Even though it was causing like cancer--
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.440]   well, cancerous smoke to come into my body,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.960]   fill me up, addicted to nicotine for 12 years.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.440]   But not only that, like, I remember, you know,
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.120]   at work or at a bar, someone would be like,
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.240]   are you a smoker?
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.920]   I'd be like, no.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.280]   Be like, no, I can smell it on your breath.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.000]   Because when you're smoking, you're just in it.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.200]   Everyone else can tell, but you think
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.280]   because you smoked, you can't smell it on you.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:50.040]   And then it also affects other people.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.200]   Like, secondhand smoke is a real thing,
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.040]   and it can cause cancer to them.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.880]   It can hurt kids.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.080]   Like, if you're just like--
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.320]   I mean, I grew up in the '80s, man.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.600]   We'd like hotbox with cigarettes,
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.200]   with the kids in the back.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.880]   Cigarettes, not weed.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.640]   Typically in the carpool on the way to soccer.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.160]   But nonetheless, it hurts other people.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.840]   Like, secondhand smoke hurts people.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.880]   And so does unforgiveness.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.200]   Like, unforgiveness, there's some satisfaction to it.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.600]   You're like, oh, you hurt me?
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.560]   Well, guess what?
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.520]   You're dead to me.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.360]   Like, I'm gonna block you out of my life,
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.200]   walls up emotionally, relationally, spiritually.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.080]   Like, I'm like, hate you in my heart,
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.560]   even though I may see you,
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.920]   still like your thing on Instagram, you know, follow you.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.480]   But I'm gonna flatter you,
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.920]   and we're gonna act like we're okay,
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.000]   but I actually like, I kinda hate you.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.440]   I don't forgive you.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.120]   Gives me satisfaction to do so.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.160]   But that's actually killing you inside.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.040]   Unforgiveness, it's been said, is like drinking poison
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.880]   and wishing that the other person would die.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.480]   Like, you're the one that's suffering
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.640]   in your unforgiveness.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.040]   They're going about their life like, I don't know.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.320]   I didn't even know that I hurt them.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.440]   Or maybe I did, but they don't care.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.280]   But you're the one dying inside
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.240]   because of your unforgiveness.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.960]   And then in Hebrews 12, it says,
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.360]   beware that a root of bitterness
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.040]   doesn't grow up and defile many.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.800]   So like secondhand smoke, unforgiveness will spread.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.960]   Your bitterness and resentment and unforgiveness
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.560]   will begin to spread to your other relationships
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.080]   as you're just like toxic with that unforgiveness.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.240]   And so as we're talking about the return of Jesus Christ,
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.020]   and he is returning, we don't know the day or the hour,
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.000]   but it is a certain fact.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.760]   He came once, he's coming again.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.840]   Will he find us, the forgiven ones,
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.640]   being unforgiven to our fellow brother or sister?
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.880]   And so here's the deal, like in every relationship,
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.680]   every relationship, there is sin.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.960]   One, 'cause you're in it,
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.160]   and two, 'cause another person is.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.720]   And so there's sin in that relationship.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.420]   It doesn't matter if it's your coworker, your roommate,
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.180]   your friend you're sitting by tonight, family of origin,
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.460]   whoever it is, you have sin in the relationship.
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.720]   Some's gonna be by you, some will be caused by you,
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.640]   others will be against you, but there's gonna be sin.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.240]   And so we've gotta know how to deal with that sin.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.560]   And how we deal with sin is how God dealt with our sin
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.600]   through Jesus, which is by forgiveness.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.800]   And so we've gotta be a people
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.600]   that when there's a foul in the relationship,
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.820]   that we can forgive or seek forgiveness
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.400]   so that that sin doesn't have a place
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.880]   just bringing cancer into the relationship.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.520]   My son had a basketball, our oldest son,
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.420]   had a basketball game this past weekend,
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.200]   and they lost by like three points.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.640]   And he was so frustrated when he come off,
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.000]   he's like, "Dad, those were the worst refs ever.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.560]   "There were so many fouls,
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.060]   "and they weren't calling any of them."
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.680]   Which is how we feel when we're sinned against,
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.760]   like, "Oh my goodness, did you not know that was a foul?
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.600]   "You can't treat people that way."
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.280]   And we want justice for them, but then when we sin,
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.680]   man, we want like mercy and grace.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.320]   We want somebody to call a foul.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.080]   And so here it is, this is where we're going tonight.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.560]   If there's been a foul in a relationship,
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.800]   somebody did something they shouldn't do,
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.400]   maybe you did what you shouldn't do.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.040]   It's F, it stands for follow God, not your feelings.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.900]   O, own your part.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.520]   U, move from unrest in the relationship to unity.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.680]   And then L, love like God.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.520]   So that's where we're gonna be tonight.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.440]   And here's what I would say is that
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.960]   when there's a foul in a relationship,
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.160]   we need to gospel our relationships.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.280]   When there's a foul, we need to gospel our relationship.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.720]   Grammarians call this denominalization.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.680]   It's when you take a noun and you use it as a verb.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.720]   So when I say, "Hey, we need to gospel our relationship,
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.060]   "the gospel is that God is holy, we sin,
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.900]   "so he sent his son, Jesus, to live a perfect life,
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.740]   "die the death that we deserve
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.380]   "so that we could be forgiven,
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:10.380]   "raised again to show that he was God in flesh,
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.380]   "that whoever believes in him will not perish,
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.360]   "but have eternal life."
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.760]   That is the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ,
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.240]   and how you can be forgiven of your sins.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.800]   And so when I say we need to gospel our relationship,
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.560]   gospel being noun,
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.720]   it's because in the gospel,
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.480]   it's that there is sin that is separated.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.640]   Well, that happens in our earthly relationships
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.960]   as well as our spiritual relationship with God.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.120]   There's sin that's been committed,
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.400]   so it's acknowledged, it's confessed.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.140]   Then there's forgiveness
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.200]   in the midst of that sin, relationally.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.360]   There is with God and there should be with us.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.000]   And then there's reconciliation.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.580]   It says that we've been reconciled back to God
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.640]   through his son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.340]   And so there's an aim at reconciliation
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.260]   when there's sin that is separated.
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.160]   So we need to gospel our relationships.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.840]   You think about like some of the words that are used,
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.740]   like I Googled it.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.540]   Well, Google is not a verb, it's a noun,
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.540]   it's a search engine.
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.940]   Like you can't, it's a noun,
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.980]   but we take it and we make it into a verb.
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.740]   Or you say they friended me.
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.300]   You know, Facebook brought that one in.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.700]   It's like, well, friend is a noun,
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.420]   but now we've used it as a verb.
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.700]   I was staring at, I stayed in an Airbnb
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.420]   and I laid down on the bed
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.260]   and the bed like, came up on both sides of me.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260]   I was like, nah, no.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.620]   So I emailed the guy, I'm like,
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.420]   "Hey man, we're gonna have to work out a discount
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.820]   "or something because your bed just tacoed me."
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.020]   I didn't have explained to him what he meant.
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.260]   And in the same way, we've got to gospel our relationship.
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.900]   We have received the gospel.
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.940]   Now we give and live the gospel when there is a foul.
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.860]   So first, follow God, not feelings.
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.020]   You know, your feelings are gonna lead you to think
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.380]   and believe and desire like, no, no, I know.
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.860]   No, you don't understand.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.060]   Like, that's great that you're gonna talk about forgiveness.
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.980]   You don't know what happened to me
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.300]   with maybe the sexual abuse you suffered
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.980]   or the emotional abuse or the sin that was committed
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.940]   maybe by your ex against you or a friend that betrayed you
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.500]   or a worker that like, did you wrong
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.180]   with your relationship there at work or lied about you.
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.020]   Who knows what it's like.
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:29.300]   Hey, I'm gonna forgive some things, but that one, nah, never.
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.940]   Not that person, not that time.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.260]   Not as many times as they did it over and over and over.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.900]   They said, sorry, and then they did it on repeat.
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:43.060]   So no, no, I'm not gonna forgive them.
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.740]   That's our feelings.
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.740]   But God's gonna give us a different way.
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.460]   God's gonna show us in his eternal,
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.980]   inerrant truth, the way to live.
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.300]   Because if we don't,
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.780]   if we follow our feelings instead of God,
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.420]   you're literally in the jail cell.
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.020]   They're free.
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.660]   You're the one that has self-imprisoned yourself
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.100]   in a prison of unforgiveness.
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.260]   And you hold the key.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.580]   Like the key being the cross,
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.820]   the gospel will unlock that prison of unforgiveness
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.980]   that you can go free.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.980]   And so we follow God, not our feelings.
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:22.220]   And obedience is not determined by the outcome.
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.300]   And so like, if you're like,
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.620]   man, I know they're not even gonna let,
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.620]   they're not even gonna be sorry.
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.940]   There'll be no remorse.
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.440]   They'll probably do it again.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.220]   It's like, we still, God's asking you to step into it
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.660]   for you to be faithful, regardless of how they respond.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.980]   You're not responsible for their response.
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.460]   There's a phrase out in the world that says,
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.620]   time heals all wounds.
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.460]   You've heard that, right?
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.460]   Like time heals all wounds.
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.820]   It doesn't.
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.900]   Time makes wounds worse.
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:51.900]   Because like, I can't believe you've never addressed that.
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:56.480]   Now you, if you sin against someone,
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.020]   you might think time heals all wounds
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.420]   'cause you've gotten some time, space and distance from it.
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.700]   But if you're the one that's been hurt,
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.380]   you're like, I can't believe it.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.040]   That happened when we were in high school.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.060]   That happened in college.
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.260]   That happened, you know, all my life growing up
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.700]   and they've never said a word about it.
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.220]   Time doesn't heal all wounds.
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.160]   Time will make you be unforgiving and bitter.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.480]   I was backpacking through Europe.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.460]   I was in Hungary.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:27.200]   I finished a water bottle.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.880]   And I took it as I was walking.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.420]   And I just like threw it in the trash can, kept walking.
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.580]   And all of a sudden I hear like in Hungarian,
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.780]   which I don't speak, like,
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.540]   (imitates gunfire)
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.460]   somebody yelling.
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.820]   And I was like, dude, somebody just got mugged.
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.880]   And I turned around and then I see this Hungarian woman,
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.820]   like reaching into the trash can
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.380]   and like pulls out the water bottle.
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.140]   And now she's walking at me like,
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.660]   (imitates gunfire)
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:57.500]   yelling at me.
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.700]   And I'm like, I don't know.
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.540]   I'm so sorry.
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.180]   I don't speak.
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.640]   And she goes, she goes, still yelling.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.060]   (water bottle crunching)
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.740]   Ha, just walks away.
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:19.220]   I have crushed every water bottle since.
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.640]   Never do I ever drink a water bottle and not crush it.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.200]   Hungarian woman, you may be watching online.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.040]   I doubt it.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:27.860]   Maybe your kids.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.700]   Thank you.
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.000]   The reason why she was so offended,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   she's like, that's taking up space in a place that I love.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.900]   Like, maybe you don't care about your country,
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.320]   but I love my country.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.280]   And you ugly American,
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.920]   that thing has taken up space in this place that I love.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.280]   And I think God's looking at all the sin
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.520]   that has been committed against us
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.440]   that's taken up space in a place that he loves.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.080]   You, your heart, your soul, your mind.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.280]   He's like, crush it.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.720]   Crush it.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.040]   Crush it at the cross.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:03.960]   I dealt with it.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.240]   It's why I came.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:10.240]   It is taking up space in a place that I love.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.080]   And so you've got two options
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.320]   to follow God and not feelings.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.280]   One is to overlook it.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.680]   If it's something where you're like, man, grace,
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.240]   like I've sinned against people.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.920]   I understand, like grace.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.720]   It says in Proverbs 19, 11,
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.200]   it is to a man or woman's glory,
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.480]   glory to overlook an offense.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.760]   They'll be like, man, I forgive them.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.920]   They don't, I don't need to go
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.260]   and have some sit down reconciliation meeting.
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.080]   Like, man, I sinned, they sinned against me.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.600]   Grace, forgiven.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.280]   If you can't, if you're like ruminating on it,
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.800]   you're gonna leave here thinking about it.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.680]   You hang up the phone.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.320]   You're like, no, no, no, no.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.900]   I can't believe that.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.600]   Then your next step is this.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.800]   It's Leviticus 19.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.040]   You didn't think we're going Leviticus.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.520]   We are.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.440]   You don't go Old Testament on them that way though.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.440]   You do this.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.600]   It says, you shall not hate your brother in your heart.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.400]   Now we're getting personal.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.240]   But, so in order that you don't hate them in your heart,
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.760]   God's like, here's the antidote.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.440]   Like they sinned against you, you're gonna hate them.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.040]   Like they hurt you, rightfully so.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.520]   Like what you're feeling is a sense of justice.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.560]   Like, man, what you did was terrible.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.880]   So God's antidote to not hating them in the heart,
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.080]   the way that you're gonna get that hate
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.920]   out of your heart is this.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.960]   But you shall reason frankly with your neighbor.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.240]   So you go to them and you talk to them about it.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.640]   And then this next part, he says,
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.960]   lest you incur sin on behalf of them.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.340]   It's like, hey, if something is done to you,
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.560]   you gotta go talk to them if you can't overlook it.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.240]   Because if you don't, you're gonna hate them in your heart.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.900]   And then you're in sin because of the sin
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.960]   that they committed because you're now hating them.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.280]   That's crazy.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.120]   But it's true.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:52.940]   That's reality.
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:53.780]   That's how God sees this.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.800]   Lest you incur sin because of him.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.720]   You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.560]   against the sons of your own people.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.400]   Here it is.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.400]   This is the second great command.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.660]   But you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.320]   God's like, well, how would you wanna be treated?
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.120]   Would you want them to hate you in your heart?
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.100]   Would you want them to hold a grudge?
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.540]   No, I didn't think so.
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.160]   Love them as you would wanna be loved.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.280]   Love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.400]   And then in case he's like, this is like,
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.720]   you know, God's way of putting a period on a sentence.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.400]   He says, I am the Lord.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.040]   Like, it's not a suggestion.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.200]   I'm God.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.240]   Don't tangle with it.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.840]   So I want you to like, you know, if you need to,
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.980]   close your eyes, look down, pull out your phone,
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.400]   take a note.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.640]   But for a second, you know what?
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.200]   Close your eyes.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.040]   Close your eyes.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:46.040]   I want you to think about the first person
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.760]   that comes to your mind when you're like,
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.880]   man, I think it's this individual
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.100]   that I either need to forgive or seek their forgiveness.
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:55.940]   Who is it?
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.960]   Ask the Lord to reveal it to you, who that is.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:07.640]   You follow God, not your feelings.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.240]   And the O is that you own your part, own your part.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.960]   Own 100% of your 2%, regardless of their percent.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.320]   So maybe like in every conflict,
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.640]   like somebody's got something to own.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.080]   And so it's like, well, no matter what my percentage is,
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.840]   I'm gonna own 2%, 15%, 20%.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.280]   I'm gonna own 100% of whatever my percent
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.800]   in that conflict was, regardless of their percent.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.320]   'Cause you may be like, well, my thing was little,
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.800]   but theirs was huge.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.800]   And God's like, well, you deal with yours first.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.160]   Like you go first.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.000]   That's what happens.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.600]   Laura was like, we were driving one time recently,
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.300]   and she's like, oh my goodness, something's in my eye.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.840]   I was like, is it a log?
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:54.080]   Yeah, you shouldn't say that to your wife.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.320]   She just like looked at me, she didn't even respond.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.600]   Matthew 7 says, why do you see the speck
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.600]   that is in your brother's eye,
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.440]   but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.600]   Or how can you say to your brother,
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.780]   let me take the speck out of your own eye
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.760]   when there's a log in your own eye?
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.160]   You hypocrite.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.880]   First take the log out of your own eye,
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.440]   then you will be able to see clearly
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.080]   to take the speck out of your brother's eye.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.360]   I think a lot of times we're like,
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.660]   man, I'm gonna own my part.
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.980]   And there's a phrase that's good.
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.580]   Like, hey, draw a circle around yourself,
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.180]   deal with everything in it.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.660]   That's good, it's just incomplete.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.820]   'Cause he says, take the log out of your eye,
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.660]   then you will be able to see clearly
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.260]   to take the speck out of your brother's.
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:36.620]   So it's not like, God's not asking you to be a doormat.
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.220]   Like, well, I guess I'll just own my sin
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.100]   and everybody gets to just like own me with their sin.
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.220]   No, like we're in a relationship.
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.800]   He's not asking you to stuff it or to withdraw.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.880]   He's like, just own your part first.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.880]   You bring humility to the table first
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.280]   and then take the speck out, but own your part first.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.400]   If you want Satan in your life,
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.840]   anybody here like, yeah, man, that sounds awesome.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.740]   I would love to have Satan in my life.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:11.360]   God's answer for that is to go to bed angry.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.480]   He says in Ephesians chapter four,
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.620]   that if you let the sun go down
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.660]   while you're still angry at someone,
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:24.660]   you have given Satan entrance into your life.
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.020]   Like that you've given him a foothold.
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.460]   You left the back door unlocked,
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.860]   like, man, nobody will probably break in.
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:35.180]   God's like, no, no, someone is checking the locks.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.540]   And if you don't forgive them, that lock's open.
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.980]   He's coming in.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.580]   You're gonna give him a foothold.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.220]   And so as you think about owning your part,
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.900]   you're like, well, when do I do that?
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.180]   How do I do that?
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.740]   Here it is in Proverbs chapter six.
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.300]   We're gonna bounce around a lot in scripture tonight.
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.680]   Proverbs six says this.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.100]   If you're ensnared by the words of your mouth,
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.300]   so you said something you shouldn't have said,
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.380]   caught in the words of your mouth,
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.100]   then do this, my son, and save yourself
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.240]   for you've come into the hand of your neighbor.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.720]   Go.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.440]   So there's like a personal movement towards the person.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.620]   In this day of like text and DM and all that,
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.060]   God's like, no, in person's best, go.
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.780]   Hasten, he says, do it quickly.
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.580]   Plead urgently with your neighbor.
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:23.180]   Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber.
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:26.180]   He's like, don't even go to bed.
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.140]   If you've sinned against someone and you're like,
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.980]   well, man, when should I deal with this?
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.260]   He's like, today.
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.240]   Today you should deal with it.
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.100]   Because if you don't, you know what you're doing?
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.660]   Their son's gonna go down on their anger.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.700]   And God is wanting us to come back together
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.220]   to gospel those relationships,
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.860]   as we are daily forgiven,
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.620]   to move towards forgiveness every single day.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.580]   In Matthew 5, 23 through 24, it says,
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.500]   so if you're offering your gift at the altar,
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.660]   and there remember that your brother
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.340]   has something against you,
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.660]   leave your gift at the altar.
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:02.340]   First, go be reconciled, then come offer your gift.
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.500]   In this case, as we just sang like all those songs,
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.820]   I wonder if we had greeters at the door being like,
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.100]   hey, is there anybody that you've sinned against
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.500]   that you need to get things right with?
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.540]   'Cause if so, Jesus says, don't come in and sing songs.
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.280]   Like I wonder how many of us would even be here.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.780]   Or if it would have been a lot more quiet,
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.180]   like, oh man, you know what?
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.780]   Yeah, let me, I need to call somebody.
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.900]   I need to reach out.
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.300]   Like, I've forgotten about that.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.740]   I've never heard that verse.
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.460]   But he says to first go do this.
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.340]   There's such an importance.
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.300]   He's like, hey, we're good.
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.220]   Like we have an unbreakable, if you've trusted in Jesus,
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.540]   we have an unbreakable covenant,
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.100]   the new covenant that is unbreakable
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.780]   because of what God has done through Jesus,
[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.620]   his life, death, and resurrection.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.700]   We're gonna be good.
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.380]   Now that one horizontally, that relationship,
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.260]   like, I don't know where that's at.
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.900]   So he's like, leave your gift.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:54.960]   I'll still be here.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.000]   Go get that right and come back.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.800]   I was a groomsman at a wedding.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.780]   So much of my drunkenness happened in Austin, Texas.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:06.500]   And that's funny, people are like laughing.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.060]   It's like, yeah, that shoe fits.
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:13.620]   So we used to have this rent house
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:18.060]   and it was an amazing house, threw great parties at it.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.460]   It was on 250 acres, but it was a 12 minute drive
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.100]   to downtown Austin, like best thing in the world.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.420]   360 in Spotswood Springs.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.740]   And we would like throw these parties.
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.620]   And then after we moved out, I was like,
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.480]   oh man, kind of hate to give up the house.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.220]   Like, it's a great party spot.
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:37.100]   And I knew, 'cause the landlord was also the owner,
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.440]   it was her family's house,
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.620]   that she wasn't gonna get renters anytime soon
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.860]   and she would leave the utilities on.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.500]   'Cause we just, she kept them in her name.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.380]   So I was like, I'm gonna make a way to get back in here
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.940]   and we're still gonna throw parties.
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.140]   So I left one of the windows kind of,
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.780]   well, unhinged on the thing.
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:57.540]   And I would climb up over this, I don't know, like cellar
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.920]   to climb into this window, like pull myself up, get in,
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.780]   pop open the front door and be like, it's on,
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:05.700]   party's happening.
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.860]   Well, there's a word for that.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.680]   There's a term in legal communities,
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.380]   it's called breaking and entering.
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.980]   And one time when I was in there,
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.340]   I like kicked out the chandelier and you're like,
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.460]   how did you kick a chandelier?
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.860]   I jumped and I got it.
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:25.060]   But like busted stuff, like used up utilities
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.400]   and just left a mess, you know, cigarettes,
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.100]   like in church, leaving on the floor,
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.240]   cans, bottles smashed.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.840]   And then I trusted in Jesus.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.500]   And I was back in Austin, I'd left Austin,
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.520]   now I was back in Austin and I was back in Austin
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.220]   as a believer, no longer an alcoholic or a drunk,
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.580]   now a disciple.
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:49.940]   And I'm there and I'm downtown and she had a store downtown.
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.460]   And I'm literally with my buddies who I used to party with
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.340]   at the house and I'm like,
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:58.180]   dude, I gotta go see Mrs. Wendland.
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.740]   And they're like, what?
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:00.580]   Her old landlord?
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.740]   I'm like, yeah, I gotta go see her.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.260]   Like for what?
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.500]   I'm like, I smashed up her house,
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.500]   like breaking and entering, like I mean, you were there.
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.980]   Like, I gotta go see her and make this right.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:17.100]   And they're like, you know her husband's an attorney, right?
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.580]   Like, I've gotta go.
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.960]   And so I literally, I mean, I'm broke.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.780]   I'd quit my job, I was going into ministry,
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:27.420]   like just in this study program, ATM, debit card,
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.860]   pull out whenever I could.
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.340]   I think it was 250 bucks, which was a ton for me.
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.940]   It was equivalent of like pulling out $10,000.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:36.900]   Stick in my pocket, walk into her shop.
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.580]   And I'm like, she's not gonna remember me.
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.540]   This is gonna be so weird.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.120]   And I walk in and she like looks up from the desk.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.660]   She goes, oh, hey, John.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.900]   Look, oh man, this just got worse.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.080]   Like I wished you didn't remember me.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.540]   I wish you hated me.
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.220]   She was like, how have you been?
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.780]   I was like, good.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.580]   She's like, why are you here today?
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.820]   And I'm like, Mrs. Winland,
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:03.960]   I have something I need to tell you.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.300]   I was owning my part.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:11.220]   I was like, I used to break into your house after we left.
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.100]   I smashed out the chandelier, I threw parties.
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.060]   I'm sure you had to have people come clean it up,
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.420]   all the bottles and cans and cigarette butts.
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.700]   And I am so sorry.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:25.700]   I was a drunk, alcoholic idiot, but that's no excuse.
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.420]   And I wanna start paying you back for cleaning fees
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.540]   and whatever you had to do with that light fixture.
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.420]   And like, this is what I can give you now
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.780]   and I will give you more later.
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.060]   And I'm so sorry.
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.060]   Will you please forgive me?
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.140]   With cash out.
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.060]   She literally pushes my hand back and says,
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.060]   John, don't worry about that.
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.340]   I don't even remember that.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.900]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.860]   You were always so kind.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.300]   But John, I know someone who's also struggling
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.100]   with addiction, could you help them?
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.260]   I'm like, what?
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:02.260]   God, like the forgiveness in that moment,
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:07.020]   trying to own my part, trying to make an amends
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:11.140]   and how God uses even what I had done to help somebody else.
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.980]   I'm like, yeah, give anybody my number that I could help.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:20.760]   I think what I said that day is one of the hardest phrases
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.900]   to say in the American English language.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.160]   It's, will you please forgive me?
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.820]   I think it's one of the, I mean, the words,
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.620]   like you just like the pain
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.300]   and trying to muster them out of your mouth
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:37.180]   because it's just like, it's death to pride,
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:41.780]   death to self, death to ego and so essential.
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:48.140]   And so you say the phrase, will you please forgive me?
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.620]   And if it doesn't have a question mark on it,
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.140]   you did not ask them for forgiveness.
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.580]   Sometimes we're like, hey, please forgive me.
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:53.740]   It's like, what, you said it against me
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:54.940]   and now you're telling me what to do.
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.420]   You're telling me to forgive you,
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.820]   but you attach please to it.
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.660]   Try again.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.740]   So say it with me.
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:02.760]   Will you please forgive me?
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.980]   One, two, three.
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:07.140]   Will you please forgive me?
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.180]   Like those words will transform your relationships.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.780]   Those words will help gospel your relationship
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:14.400]   and it's never too late.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.540]   It's never too late.
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:20.440]   It should mark us asking for an extending forgiveness.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.500]   And then when somebody asks you,
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.080]   it's how you want to be treated.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.340]   Like, yes, nothing but grace.
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.000]   Yeah, I've been forgiven by Jesus.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:29.980]   Of course I forgive you.
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.300]   How could I ever hold anything against you?
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.100]   That would be as crazy as smoking in church.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:39.300]   To be a part of the church and not forgive
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.540]   even though I have been forgiven in Jesus.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:45.380]   And I wanna give you another phrase that like,
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.180]   if you're talking about like forgiveness and whatnot,
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.960]   here's a pro tip, this is free.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.160]   The other night, my daughter, I didn't know,
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.120]   I walk into our bedroom,
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.960]   we just had our carpets cleaned for like $400,
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.360]   which you're like, that's a lot of money.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.200]   Well, we have three kids, they trash our carpets.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.320]   And so a week later, I walk into our master bedroom
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.360]   and I'm like, what in the world?
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.200]   There's blue spots, blue all over our carpet.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.560]   I'm like, what happened?
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:17.080]   And Laura's like, Penny was in here doing handstands.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.240]   And I'm like, with a blue marker, like what?
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.280]   And she's like, well, there was cookie cake
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.120]   and yeah, that's what it, I'm like, Penny, get in here.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.880]   And Laura's like, no, no, no, hey, hey,
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.120]   that's a little much.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.360]   And I'm like, no, no, it's not too much.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.600]   Penny, get in here.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.240]   Penny walks in, she already knows,
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.340]   she's like looking like dejected already.
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.800]   I'm like, what did you do?
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.360]   Do you see something wrong in this house?
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.680]   She's like, yes, she's seven.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:49.480]   And I go, what happened, Penny?
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.880]   She's like, icing.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.920]   I'm like, how, Penny, how did it happen?
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.720]   She's like, I was doing handstands.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.180]   I'm like, why would you do handstands
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.760]   with icing on your fingers?
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.440]   She's just like, looking down.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.760]   I was like, is there anything you wanna say?
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.120]   She's like, will you please forgive me?
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:11.520]   I'm like, I'm like top notch jerk.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.540]   This is like last week, PS.
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:18.280]   You're like, smoking's not your only problem.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.280]   And so I'm like, yes, I forgive you, you're dismissed.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.620]   I don't know, something terrible.
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.120]   She goes to her bedroom, time passes,
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.720]   and Laura's like, hey, that was probably a little harsh.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.800]   I'm like, I don't think it was, look at our carpet.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.120]   I'm down there scrubbing it.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.520]   And then I walk in, I'm like, all right, Penny,
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.420]   time for bed.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.560]   And I'm like, Penny, it's time for bed.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.680]   And she's just sitting on the bed,
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.860]   like staring holes through my soul.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.080]   And she goes, how come when you have an accident,
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.440]   you want us to treat you nice,
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.140]   but when I have an accident, you talk to me like that?
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:33:00.000]   From the mouth of babes, I was like,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.760]   and here's the pro tip, in case you're like,
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.500]   those are not parenting pro tips.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:08.560]   Here's the pro tip.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.320]   I was like, you're right.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.100]   You're right stops the fight.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.400]   I said, you're right, you're so right, Penny.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.200]   I'm so sorry, I treated you horribly.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.320]   Would you please forgive me?
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.120]   I'm so sorry, dad should never talk to you that.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.000]   And you're right when I have an accident,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.400]   I don't wanna be treated that way, I'm so sorry.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:31.760]   And her demeanor went from like, I'm gonna light you up
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.040]   to like smiling and like, okay, we can read a book now
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.300]   and go to bed.
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.320]   Like so good at forgiving,
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.320]   but it was all because I'm like, you're right.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.560]   That's what we want, right?
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.840]   Like when you've hurt someone,
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.040]   what they're wanting is like, do you have any idea
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.280]   like the pain that you caused me?
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.960]   And if you start making excuses,
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.040]   like, well, the reason why I did it,
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.680]   and you know that I was late and traffic was hard,
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.760]   and do you know the pressure that I'm under at at work?
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.400]   And how come you never do your share of the bills
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.560]   and all the stuff?
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.400]   And what about you?
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.340]   I mean, you let us into temptation last week too.
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:03.480]   Like all that stuff, instead of you're like,
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:08.120]   you're right, you're so right, stops the fight.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:08.960]   Own your part.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.780]   So follow God, not your feelings.
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.620]   Own your part.
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.640]   You is moved from unrest to unity.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.400]   If you have unrest in a relationship,
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.760]   or if there's any relationship where you're like,
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.000]   man, I hope I don't see them.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.600]   If there's any relationship that you ghost them,
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.160]   or you see their call or ID pop up and you're like,
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.320]   whatever, like, no,
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.840]   can't believe you would even call me.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.480]   Like, or you've deleted their number,
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.440]   it's showing up on Mark.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.080]   If there's unrest in the relationship,
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.640]   God's command, not suggestion, not idea,
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.760]   not like, what if, or hey, that might be nice.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:44.760]   His command is that we move from unrest to unity.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.380]   Then we gospel the relationship.
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.100]   We were at unrest with God,
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:51.380]   and he pursued us to be unified through Jesus.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.900]   And so he's like, hey, do the same thing.
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.120]   And so unification is the reason.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.020]   It's always the reason for confrontation.
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.340]   Confrontation is not like to twist their knife,
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:02.500]   rub the nose in it, show them how they're wrong.
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.300]   They were, make them feel stupid,
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.020]   embarrass them in front of others.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:09.180]   Unification is always the reason biblically
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.340]   for confrontation.
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.140]   You're going to them for the purpose
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.540]   that the relationship would be restored
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.720]   just as yours had been through Jesus Christ, your Lord.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.520]   You're gonna gospel the relationship.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.980]   Unification, moving from unrest to unity.
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.740]   In 2 Corinthians 2, verse 6 through 11,
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:29.960]   there was someone who would sin greatly,
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.060]   so greatly that there was church discipline.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.780]   Paul's like, hey, with such a one, don't even share a meal.
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.140]   Turn them over to Satan for the destruction of their flesh.
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:38.540]   Well, the person repented.
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.940]   And so now Paul writes,
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:44.220]   "For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough.
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:48.300]   So you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him,
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.140]   or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow."
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.540]   Gospel the relationship.
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.460]   "So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him,
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.060]   not just like, hey, you're forgiven, but I love you.
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:01.180]   For this is why I wrote that I might test you
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.140]   and know whether you're obedient in everything,
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.780]   obedient in discipline, obedient in forgiveness.
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.980]   Anyone whom you forgive, I forgive also.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.020]   Indeed, what I have forgiven,
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.300]   I have forgiven anything that has been for your sake
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.300]   in the presence of Christ."
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.540]   Listen, "So that," like, what's the purpose of this?
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.820]   All this forgiveness stuff.
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.280]   What are we after here?
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.740]   "So that we would not be outwitted by Satan,
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:30.100]   for we are not ignorant of his designs."
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.140]   Satan wants you to be unforgiving.
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.980]   It's his aim.
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.440]   That whole, like, don't let the sun go down on your anger,
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.100]   that whole, 'cause Satan will get a foothold.
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.900]   Here's what he's after.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.900]   This person had been isolated from the body of Christ
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.620]   because of their sin.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:50.620]   And sometimes we're like, yeah, good.
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.940]   They did what they did.
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:56.500]   And the Holy Spirit, as written through Paul, is like,
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.220]   "No, forgive them.
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.740]   Reaffirm your love for them,
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.800]   because we're not ignorant of Satan's designs,
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.540]   that we would be outwitted by him,
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:12.540]   where he wants to divide and separate and shame and shun
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.240]   and condemn and accuse."
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.720]   Those are his words, and those are his actions.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.580]   But instead, "That we would move from unrest to unity
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:25.300]   and pursue towards that person with forgiveness and love."
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.340]   And I think about, like, the most difficult time
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.700]   in my life, the hardest thing that's ever been done to me.
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.940]   I mentioned it in a message a couple of weeks ago,
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.420]   is when I found out that the person I was with
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:39.260]   was sleeping with one of my friends.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:43.900]   And the, like, the betrayal by both of them,
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:48.900]   the hurt, the pain, like I wanted to kill.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:53.280]   But what happened was, like, and this didn't take long,
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:59.180]   the hatred in my heart was literally unraveling me.
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:02.860]   Like the black, dark hatred, where I'm like,
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:07.620]   I want my friend dead, and I want revenge on her.
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:12.620]   It was eating me alive all day, every day, ad nauseum.
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.500]   To the point, and I wasn't even a believer yet,
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:19.060]   I literally pick up the phone to my friend, I'm like,
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:22.180]   "Hey," he wouldn't take my calls anymore, shocker,
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.580]   I told him I wanted to kill him.
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.840]   So I got his voicemail, and I was like,
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:29.240]   "Hey, I said some horrible things to you,
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.220]   and will you please forgive me?"
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:36.380]   And I think he's probably like, "Me forgive you?"
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.620]   He never called back.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.360]   And then I called the girl.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.740]   I'm like, "Hey, it must've been miserable
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.020]   being with an alcoholic.
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.520]   Like, I don't have a category for that.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.700]   Will you please forgive me for everything
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.660]   that I brought into our relationship?"
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.360]   Because we were at unrest, and it was killing me,
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.620]   it was killing the relationships.
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.820]   And so it was my attempt to move towards unity.
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.900]   So you don't talk about them, instead you go to them.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.180]   Matthew 18, verses 15 through 17, it says,
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:10.940]   "If your brother or sister sins against you,
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.860]   go," there it is again, like the Proverbs,
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:17.860]   "Go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone."
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.660]   Now it says, "Tell him his fault,
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.860]   and I want to remind you to love your neighbors yourself."
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.380]   So when you tell him his fault, you need to be mindful
[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.740]   of how would I like my fault to be told to me?
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:30.680]   Between you and him alone.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.540]   If he listens to you, you've gained your brother,
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.500]   but if he doesn't listen,
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.540]   take one or two others along with you.
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:41.580]   This is not to like gang up on someone, to dogpile them,
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.820]   to like come at them, but rather like,
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.260]   "Hey, these are others from your sphere of influence.
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:48.260]   We're gonna come to you out of love,
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.060]   'cause we're concerned, we're at unrest.
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:52.180]   We need to move towards unity."
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:57.700]   And a lot of us, like there's a spectrum of truth and grace.
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.900]   It said Jesus was full of truth and grace.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:04.500]   So there's people who are like, "Man, I am uber truthful.
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.300]   Like I call a spade a spade, I call it, I say what is,
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:12.180]   like that's just true, and I'm gonna let you know."
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.820]   And then there's others that are like,
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.580]   "Man, that's like harsh to me.
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.160]   Like you are always gonna know that I love you.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.300]   Like there's just love that flows from you,
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.260]   and you get that part."
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.300]   So all the truth tellers in the room,
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.060]   raise your hands, where are you at?
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:29.540]   Yup, yup, some people just like scooched over,
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.740]   like, "That's nice, I didn't know that."
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:34.460]   And where's the love people?
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.300]   Yeah, yeah, okay, good.
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:38.760]   So hey, you're both wrong.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:43.820]   Welcome, I'll be your motivational speaker for the night.
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.900]   Jesus was full of truth and grace.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.220]   So in 1 Corinthians 13,
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.780]   like quintessential chapter about love,
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:54.540]   he's like, "If you've got truth, but you don't have love,
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.060]   you're a nuisance."
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:59.260]   But the reverse is true, that if you've got love,
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.880]   but you don't have truth, you're negligent.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:06.280]   And so the truth is from God is to marry the two,
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.780]   that you would have truth and grace.
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.700]   So you do, you go to your brother, you show the fault,
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.140]   but it's always in love, from unrest to unity.
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:15.560]   So you've got follow God, not your feelings,
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:18.220]   own your part, moving from unrest to unity,
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.780]   and the acrostic foul, and then the last one is,
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:25.460]   love like God, love like God.
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:32.740]   Ephesians 4, 32 through 5, it says this,
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:37.100]   "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted,
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.580]   forgiving one another."
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.020]   Here it is, gospeling your relationships.
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.500]   "As God in Christ forgave you,
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.980]   therefore," in case you missed it,
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:52.980]   he says it again, "Be imitators of God as beloved children."
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:58.140]   That's where he says to gospel your relationship,
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:02.780]   explicitly, he says, "Forgive one another
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:06.860]   as God in Christ forgave you."
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.700]   And as if it wasn't enough, he's like, "Imitate me."
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.540]   Like, how did I do that for you?
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.300]   Did I make you pay penance?
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.580]   Did I tell you like, "I'll forgive you,
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.180]   come back in 10 years, clean up your act first,
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.820]   quit smoking, quit the weed, quit vaping,
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:20.740]   quit with the alcohol,
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.140]   sleeping with your boyfriend and girlfriend,
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.740]   the porn addiction, all the unforgiveness in your heart,
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.060]   get all that right, then come to me."
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:30.300]   No, no, he's like, "You wanna be forgiven?
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.740]   That's why I sent my son today, the day of salvation.
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:36.340]   You believe, you confess Jesus as Lord,
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.300]   believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead,
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:43.020]   you're safe, period, end of story, today."
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.580]   That's what God does, he's like, "Imitate me,
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:50.260]   imitate me, reflect me to this dying world
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:55.260]   like they are dying and going to hell forever.
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.500]   So I need you to imitate me,
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.500]   and the way that I want you to imitate me
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:04.500]   is to be kind and tenderhearted and forgiving
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:10.660]   as God the Father in Christ forgave you.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.740]   We love like God.
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:17.720]   On February 3rd, this is recent, what, 25 days ago,
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.700]   in Germany, they just found a bomb,
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.500]   550 pound bomb on the rail line
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.420]   that goes from Switzerland into Germany,
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:27.180]   one of the most traveled routes,
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.880]   north-south connecting the two countries.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:34.020]   And they know, they discovered by identifying it,
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.520]   who is responsible for it.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:39.060]   So any guess who put the bomb there?
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:42.540]   I heard Russia.
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:47.540]   Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Al-Shabaab,
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.900]   like there's so many terror groups.
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:52.220]   Who would put that, who wants to blow apart
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:54.860]   civilian train full of people?
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:44:00.420]   Oops, it's our bomb.
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.140]   It's our bomb, it's the United States,
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.020]   it's the Allied Forces bomb
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.560]   that they just happened to discover just now.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.260]   It's our bomb from World War II.
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.460]   Happens all the time in Germany.
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:15.140]   And the reason why it's still there
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:16.780]   is because Germany got decimated.
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.780]   Like once the tide turned on World War II,
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:22.980]   we were just dropping ordinance all over Germany
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.000]   to bomb them into surrender.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.180]   And what Germany did is they just clamored
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:31.180]   to rebuild Germany after it had been decimated
[00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:33.620]   in World War II, and they literally built
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:36.500]   their country upon bombs.
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:40.340]   They're finding them all over the place.
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.900]   Every time they do construction, they find bombs.
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:45.380]   Water levels go down on rivers in the summertime,
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:46.340]   they find bombs.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.540]   They have rebuilt their country on top of bombs,
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:49.940]   and so have we.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:52.660]   Because bombs don't go away, bombs go off.
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:56.180]   And we're like, ah, that was a long time ago.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.900]   I probably don't need to go ask their forgiveness.
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.260]   They probably forgotten about it anyway.
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:00.980]   Or man, that was a long time ago,
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:02.100]   I just shouldn't even bring it up again.
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.540]   That'd be super awkward.
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.220]   Well, bombs don't go away, bombs go off.
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:07.140]   And so we've got to unearth those things.
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.420]   What they do, they call in an expert,
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:12.660]   a demolition expert who knows how to dismantle the bomb,
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:13.900]   and so must we.
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:16.300]   When we love like God, it's not like, okay, God,
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.340]   like I'll just forgive them by my own strength.
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.640]   If you would, you wouldn't have need this lesson tonight.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.700]   There are people that have done things in my life
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.040]   where I'm like, God, I forgive them.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.060]   And you know what, the very next day, I don't forgive them.
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:30.780]   I'm like, dude, I can't believe it.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.140]   Honestly, like that's unbelievable.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:34.540]   Root of bitterness starts to grow up.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.900]   I'm like, oh, it's a dash light on my soul.
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.580]   Like, okay, God, again, I'm giving this to you.
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.900]   Lord, I forgive them.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:46.140]   I'm taking that bomb to the only one
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.540]   who can take care of it before it blows me apart
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:51.140]   and the relationship and be like,
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.380]   okay, I'm bringing this to you again.
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.220]   Like it came up again, Satan reminded me,
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:57.220]   my flesh, my ego, like whatever it is, it's back again.
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.780]   So I've got to bring this back to you
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.580]   because the feelings are gonna come back,
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:03.680]   but we're not following feelings.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.860]   We're gonna love like God,
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.100]   and we're gonna let God dismantle all that stuff.
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.980]   So here's two things.
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:15.420]   One, you're like, well, how can I forgive
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.060]   what was done to me?
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:20.660]   If they're a believer, if the person has trusted in Jesus
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:23.820]   for the forgiveness of sins, all of their sin,
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:26.600]   Colossians 2 says has been nailed to the cross.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:31.040]   Jesus, Jesus, God in flesh forgave their sin.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:34.220]   So who are you to be like, man, I know you did
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:37.500]   and you forgive mine, but nah, I'm not.
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:43.140]   That's exponentially crazier than smoking in church.
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:45.980]   The audacity that we would not forgive
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.600]   what Jesus forgave at the cross.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.220]   But others, you might be like, no,
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:52.180]   the person's not a believer.
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:56.300]   The person that sexually abused me like monster.
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.720]   And no, they are not a follower of Christ.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:04.940]   In Romans chapter 12, it says, do not take revenge.
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.420]   You're like, great, doormat, no.
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:09.980]   God says it's mine to avenge.
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.460]   He's gonna deal with it.
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:13.580]   He's gonna deal with their sin,
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.880]   either at the cross if that person trusts in Jesus
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:21.780]   or forever in eternity in hell.
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:23.600]   But their sin will be dealt with.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:27.740]   And that should move us as Jesus says,
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:31.220]   pray for your enemies because you don't want,
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:36.220]   I mean, anybody to spend eternity in hell.
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.420]   That is the most terrifying thought.
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:41.360]   And so you pray for your enemy,
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:45.420]   knowing that to love like God,
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:49.440]   even as Jesus was on the cross, father, forgive them.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.780]   They were crucifying him.
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.980]   And in the moment when he could have said anything,
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:56.300]   it's like, forgive them.
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:57.140]   They know not what they do.
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:00.140]   They have no idea the gravity of what they're doing.
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:04.360]   Praying for his enemies from the cross as they killed him.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:09.380]   And we're to love like God, love like God.
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:11.660]   So if there's a foul, follow God, not your feelings,
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:14.820]   own your part, unrest to unity and love like God.
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:17.740]   You remember the cigarettes and I'm gonna crush these
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:20.520]   so that nobody picks them up afterwards.
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:27.400]   I was in Switzerland and it gotten high.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.600]   This was, I don't know, 20 years ago.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.860]   Gotten high, I was literally like walking through,
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.060]   this is before weed was legal in parts of America.
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:40.540]   I'm walking through a field, like a farm of weed
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.220]   and gotten high there with people from,
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:43.740]   I don't know where as I was backpacking,
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.460]   same trip as the hungry thing.
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:46.460]   No, a different one actually.
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:51.460]   Anyway, I mean, it's just there for the taking and cheap.
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:57.460]   But I literally was like, I can't take any back with me.
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:01.380]   And it's not because I had some like moral conscience,
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:03.220]   like, I don't know, that'd be, I mean,
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.720]   I had no conscience at that point in time, I wanted to.
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.900]   The reason why is because there was US customs.
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:09.820]   I knew that I would get to US customs
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:13.340]   with drug sniffing dogs and that land that I was headed to
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:16.140]   is like, no, you don't bring that in here.
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:20.260]   We don't bring that in here into this land.
[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:22.160]   And now if you've trusted in Jesus,
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.300]   you have stepped into the kingdom of God
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:27.500]   and customs in his word, his custom is like,
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:30.180]   no, you don't bring unforgiveness here.
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:33.020]   It's like, that is so opposite of the gospel.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:34.460]   You don't bring that here.
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:37.220]   And I'm gonna check you as you go through this scam,
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.100]   the Holy Spirit, like we're gonna look at your soul
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:40.180]   and I'm gonna convict you like,
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:41.900]   hey, you've got unforgiveness there.
[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:44.800]   It's killing you, destroying your own relationships.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.300]   Like you've got to deal with that.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:49.360]   We don't bring that into this land.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:55.360]   So that you can be free, free, free.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.680]   That they would be free.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:02.680]   That we would love like God and gospel our relationships.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.780]   Let me pray.
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:08.980]   Father, there are literally no words.
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:11.760]   We will sing for all eternity
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:17.160]   of your forgiveness through Jesus.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.960]   (soft music)
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.720]   And may we now become the most forgiving people.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:26.600]   Forgiving others who have sinned against us
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.780]   and asking for forgiveness for those
[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:29.680]   that we have sinned against.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.560]   I pray there'd be a movement by the people
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:35.160]   who are hearing your word tonight.
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:39.960]   And that we would never be as audacious
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:46.120]   to bring that illegal substance of unforgiveness,
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:50.400]   that cancerous unforgiveness into your kingdom.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.580]   It's got no place.
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:54.880]   Thank you for forgiving us.
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:51:00.240]   Now move in our life to forgive and seek forgiveness.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.720]   That there would be unity.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.080]   We love you, we now sing to you.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.780]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:09.800]   Y'all, please now stand and sing to the one
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.420]   who forgave all of your sins.
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:14.760]   (whooshing)
