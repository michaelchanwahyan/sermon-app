1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 What would I like? I'd like to pursue you with excellence. I want to be intentional.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,680
 Not intense, but intentional. I want to guard your heart, put a cage around that thing,

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,160
 lock it up and throw away the key. You ever heard of David's mighty men? Well, you're

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,000
 looking at one of them. I'm looking for a Proverbs 31 woman. Boom. Found her. That's

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,920
 what I'm looking for.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,000
 That was beautiful. Just looking for your coffee order.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Oh well, thank you for your authenticity. I'll have the frozen blended java chip caramel

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,960
 coffee frozen hot chocolate with some whip.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,960
 Get right on that.

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,960
 Oh man, we're doing it. Be intentional, not intense fellas. Intentional, not intense.

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:11,520
 So a couple of weeks ago, not even a couple of weeks ago, what? One weekend ago, two weekends

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,800
 ago, I was at this little deal called Launch Retreat and went there, went there Friday

13
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,720
 night and what that looked like is I knew I was going to go out there Friday night.

14
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,240
 Shane E, Shane Everett sings up here usually, um, texted me and said, Hey, do you want to

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,360
 take the girls out early? And so he has a daughter, uh, Olive, who's eight. My daughter

16
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,360
 Presley is eight. And so Shane E, his little girl and me and my little girl jump in his

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,460
 car and we're driving out to Sky Ranch. Now I've been to Sky Ranch, uh, probably 12 times.

18
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,560
 And so we're heading out there. I mean, I know the way, like the back of my hands, right?

19
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,480
 And so we pull over into some little catfish spot that was fried catfish spot. It was awfully

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,240
 wonderful. And, uh, and, uh, then we head to Sky Ranch and we're getting closer. We're,

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,000
 we're on the back roads now, uh, out there, you know, towards Van, Texas, past Van, Texas.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,440
 We've driven through the town and we're going and we get to the turn where you turn into

23
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,280
 Sky Ranch and he turns and, and we're driving down that road and we're driving and like

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,280
 any minute, like I know there's going to be this big entrance that says Sky Ranch and

25
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,560
 we're dry and I'm looking, it's going to be on the right and we're, we're driving and

26
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,560
 I'm looking, I mean, has this ever happened to you where you're going a direction and

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,800
 you're, you're, you're certain kind of that you're going the right way. And so, and we're

28
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,240
 driving that way. We're driving and we're driving and the girls are in the back. I mean,

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,000
 they're just like not even paying attention. They're writing a song back there. It's like,

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,120
 well, Olive was writing a song. Presley was writing a rap. There was going to be amazing.

31
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,840
 I was already selling it in my mind. And, um, and so, and so we keep going and I'm like,

32
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,280
 uh, may you, you sure we're going the right way? And he's like, where are you though?

33
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,040
 You're the one that's been out here. So I mean like, are you, and I'm like, man, I think

34
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,120
 it's not, I know what you're thinking. It's a pride thing. Like we're two guys and we're

35
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,940
 afraid to ask for direction. There's no one to ask. I mean, it's like pasture and cows

36
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,080
 and that's it. And I'm like, okay, let's just keep going a little further. Like let's just

37
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,720
 go a little further. And uh, and so we go a little further and we get to a stop sign.

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:10,200
 I'm like, bro, we, this ain't, this ain't right. This ain't right. And so we turn around

39
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,440
 and now at this point we're thinking, well, we missed, we missed the, the entrance. Maybe

40
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,560
 we were too caught up in the girls brilliance of the backseat or something. So we missed

41
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,200
 the entrance. And so we turned around and we're going back and we're going back and

42
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,320
 now I'm continuing to look for the entrance on the other side of the road now. And we

43
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,720
 get all the way to where we started. And we realized that that sign that said Sky Ranch

44
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,600
 this way actually said this way. And so we turned around and we, we went the right direction

45
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,520
 and we eventually got to where we're going. And the reason I start there because I think

46
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:48,940
 that story beautifully captures the idea of how most of us date. Okay. We are headed toward

47
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:54,880
 a destination. If you're a follower of Jesus Christ, that destination for you is marriage,

48
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,200
 not just marriage, but a healthy marriage. And so we don't waste time dating. We're not

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,360
 dating for fun. We're not dating for pleasure. We're not dating to seek thrills. We're not

50
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,080
 dating for attention or to affirm, you know, our insecurities. We are dating with the intention

51
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,240
 of getting married and that's the destination being married. Well, a healthy marriage, not,

52
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,920
 not half of the marriages that fail miserably, but a great marriage. And so we're moving

53
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,800
 towards that destination. But what happens for so often in our lives or in our dating

54
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,560
 lives is we take a wrong turn and we don't even realize it. And then all of a sudden

55
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,520
 we find ourselves in these conversations like, is this going somewhere? We don't even know

56
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,520
 we're moving away from our destination and we don't even realize that we think we hope,

57
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,240
 I hope this is moving towards it. And really it's going the other direction. And now we're

58
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,520
 in this predicament because we're like, well, I've invested so much time though in this

59
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,400
 relationship. And if I start over in another relationship, that's going to be like, this

60
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,680
 was all a waste. And I don't know if we're going the right way. Do you think we're going

61
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,760
 the right way? And you both kind of sense, man, maybe we took a wrong turn. Maybe we

62
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,880
 shouldn't go further this way. Maybe we should turn around. And it's like, no, let's just

63
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:15,240
 go a little further and let's just go a little bit further and a little bit further. And

64
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:23,400
 we continue to waste time in this idea. In fact, I've seen two people who could have

65
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:30,320
 been great together, ruin the possibility of being great together because they took

66
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,640
 wrong turns. I want you to realize that that's actually a possibility. You could be in a

67
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,580
 relationship with someone and you could ruin the future of that relationship because of

68
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:50,560
 decisions you make in that relationship. Wrong turns. True story. And likewise, the

69
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,480
 illustration breaks down at some point, but I think so many of us, we travel down the

70
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:02,060
 same familiar paths, hoping to get to a different destination. And yet we do it the same way

71
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,040
 over and over and over. And we actually think we're good at it. A guy told me the other

72
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,960
 day, oh, I don't need dating advice. I'm like, bro, you're on your fifth marriage. You need

73
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:16,080
 some kind of advice. You need some advice, dog. And so we kind of do this thing the same

74
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,960
 way over and over and over. We're traveling down the same familiar stop signs that we

75
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:30,080
 blow past and we hope to get to some different destination. And we're not. And so this evening

76
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,480
 I want to talk with you about dating detours. These are wrong turns that you take when you're

77
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,560
 dating and we're kicking off a series tonight called save the date, which really has a double

78
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,340
 meaning or maybe even a triple meaning because save the date is something that you receive

79
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,960
 when someone gets married. Right? And so they say, Hey, save the date. We'd love for you

80
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,520
 to be there. And so there's that idea of, Hey, we hope this is going to that destination

81
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,160
 marriage. Save the day. Also in most of our life stages is this awkward thing where we

82
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,000
 get this and are we going to put the plus one or not? Is this going to be me and somebody

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,640
 or am I going to go by myself? You know, and we have that, uh, that predicament, but, but

84
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,960
 then the double meaning really comes into play because we've got to do something different,

85
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:21,040
 man. We're not getting better at this. Let me, let me say this really quick. Your generation,

86
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,120
 your peers, y'all aren't getting good at this. Any better at this? I mean, every statistic

87
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:33,720
 that I look at causes me great concern that we are really awful at this. I mean, we have

88
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,840
 more help than ever. We got more apps. We've got okay. Cupid and Tinder and every, all

89
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,000
 kinds of hotlines and, and dating, you know, advice out there and all sorts of articles

90
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,040
 that we can read every kind of tip and trick that you want at your fingertips on your phone.

91
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,420
 And yet statistics just continue to show that we're getting worse and worse at this. Getting

92
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:00,200
 married much later. Marriages are shorter. Marriages don't last and all sorts of terrible

93
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,120
 things happen in dating. So what I need you to do before we go any further in this series

94
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:12,040
 is I need you to be open to the possibility that you might be awful at dating. I need

95
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,040
 you just to think for one second, like, man, I might be really, really bad at this. Like

96
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,100
 I, like if God shows up, Jesus shows up and he says, okay, I just want to grade you on

97
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,480
 your dating skills real quick. Like that driver's ed test or something. I don't, let me just

98
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:34,680
 tell you how good you are. You, you failed miserably. I just want you to consider that

99
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,560
 outcome for a moment and let's dive in with honest, open hearts, thinking that we might

100
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,280
 hear something new and profound from the word of God. That's going to change our lives forever

101
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:52,960
 and ever and ever deal. All right. Dating detours this evening, because if we can identify

102
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,920
 these wrong turns, they can get us back on the right track and wrong turns in the right

103
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,680
 relationship can make the right person, the wrong person. And that's what I hope to talk

104
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,000
 with you about this evening. And so I'm going to be in my new favorite Bible story. Okay.

105
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,880
 I've been studying this man's life and I love this story. And so I might camp here for two

106
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,880
 weeks, maybe even three weeks. I don't know. It's an awesome story. It's the life of Samson.

107
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:24,520
 And so if you grew up, it's going to be judges 13, 14, 15, 16. If you grew up in church at

108
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,440
 all, you probably heard this story in Sunday school. I don't even think I'm going to touch

109
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,040
 on what you heard in Sunday school. I'm going to show you his life before what Samson and

110
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,440
 who the Lila. I mean, do you know Samson was with three women. Delilah was just one of

111
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,000
 them. We're going to look at all three of those relationships this evening and try to

112
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,120
 learn from them. Now, let me give you this disclaimer before we go any further. I don't

113
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,140
 think this story is in the Bible with God. God put this here with the sole intention

114
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:00,200
 of teaching us about dating. I don't think that's why this story is here. I think this

115
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,080
 story is in the scripture to show you how much God loves his people, how he's going

116
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,960
 to redeem his people through a very imperfect person. Because whenever God wants to do something,

117
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,080
 he identifies a person. Whenever he wants to do something great, he identifies a person

118
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,520
 and says, Hey, I'm going to raise up this person to accomplish my task. And I think

119
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:25,800
 that's why this story is in the scripture. But Samson is so awful at relationships that

120
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,120
 they cost him his life and they cost him his wellbeing and his relationship with God over

121
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,360
 and over and over again. And so I hope to learn from it. So let me just tell you a little

122
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,520
 bit about this man, Samson. Samson was born a Nazirite. Now that term comes from Numbers

123
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,720
 chapter 6 verses 1 through 21. And I'm just going to explain it to you real quick. This

124
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,280
 is a person who is holy and set apart by God, who is not a priest. And there are three descriptions

125
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,880
 of a Nazirite. When you make a Nazirite vow, there are three things that you must do. The

126
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:06,240
 first one is you cannot consume alcohol. No mambo taxis for Samson. He can't do that.

127
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,960
 He can't go there. No margaritas with enchiladas. That's not how he can roll. He's a Nazirite.

128
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,520
 No consuming of alcohol. The second one would be a little easier for you. You cannot get

129
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:21,440
 near anything dead. You can't play with dead things. All right. Easy enough. God, I won't

130
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,600
 play with dead things. The third one is the weird one. Honestly, you can't cut your hair.

131
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,200
 So Samson has this ginormous man bun on the top of his head, right? I mean, this is who

132
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,240
 he is, looking all good. I mean, he's swole because the unique thing about Samson is he's

133
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,080
 got superhuman strength. He's O.G. He-Man. That's who he is. He is the strongest man

134
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,880
 in the universe walking the planet Earth. And he's got this giant man bun, and he's

135
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:57,400
 always sober, and he can't play with dead things. That's who he is. Judges chapter 14.

136
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:07,000
 "Samson," that's our boy, "went down to Timnah, and there he saw a young Philistine

137
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,840
 woman. When he returned, he said to his father and mother, 'I have seen a Philistine woman

138
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:21,580
 in Timnah. Now get her for me as my wife.'" Okay. Let me just say this right here. This

139
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:28,360
 isn't all that weird because in order to pursue someone in this day and time, you would have

140
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,680
 to go through your parents. So he's not just being a mama's boy now. He's like, "I don't

141
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,320
 know what to do. Teach me some game." No, he's like, "I want her. That's who I want

142
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,440
 to marry." Okay. "His father and mother replied, 'Isn't there an acceptable woman

143
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,160
 among your relatives or among all our people? Must you go to the uncircumcised Philistine

144
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:54,120
 to get a wife?' But Samson said to his father, 'Get her for me. She's the right one for

145
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,760
 me.'" Okay. Now when they say go to your relatives, you're like, "That's weird.

146
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:06,300
 Arkansas stuff." But no, here's what's going on. No, no. Remember that God has preserved

147
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,060
 his people. They're unique people. You've got to remember too, all of humanity came

148
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,920
 from two people. Then one family was preserved on a boat, and so there wasn't a lot of people.

149
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,400
 So that wasn't weird in this day and time. God says, "Hey, only you have to sleep with

150
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,280
 these people. These are the only people that you can intermarry, and that's how I'm going

151
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,200
 to continue this thing called that's eventually going to be Christianity." So I'm going

152
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:36,240
 to explain that more in just a second. But I want to say this last phrase to you in the

153
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,640
 Hebrew. It says, "Get her for me. She's the right one for me." It literally translates,

154
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:49,680
 "She looks good to me." He sees her from afar, and everything that God has commanded

155
00:13:49,680 --> 00:14:01,640
 him goes out the window, and he's like, "Her." It's not unlike David or Solomon. I mean,

156
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,640
 David's like, "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green

157
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,680
 pastures. He leads me beside quiet waters. He restores my soul. He guides me in paths

158
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:18,800
 of righteousness for his name's sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

159
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:28,560
 of death, I will who is that Bathsheba?" Right? This is what's going on. I mean, he's like,

160
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,960
 everything goes out the window, and he's like, "I want her. She looks good to me."

161
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,800
 And so this is his first detour. This is where he goes wrong. It's detour number one this

162
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:45,480
 evening, pursuing the wrong people. Pursuing the wrong people. This is honestly the first

163
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,720
 and biggest mistake that you can make. And so if you can lean in for this first point

164
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,160
 and get this, if you only get this first point, it will save you lots of grief. Samson was

165
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:02,640
 only to date Israelites. And I say "date" there because we date for the intention of

166
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,880
 marriage. He was only to marry within God's people. This is the command that comes from

167
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,240
 it. It's really repeated through the scripture. I'll give you one place. Deuteronomy chapter

168
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,000
 7, verse 3. "Do not intermarry with them." That's all of the "ites," if you will, around

169
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,800
 God's people. "Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or

170
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,600
 take their daughters for your sons, for they will turn your children away from following

171
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,760
 me to serve other gods, and the Lord's anger will burn against you and will quickly destroy

172
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,800
 you." Now this is exactly what happened to King Solomon. King Solomon had all those wives

173
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,080
 and all that money and all that wisdom, and yet it says at the end of his life, they turned

174
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:46,560
 his hearts towards other gods. And so Samson is breaking God's command here. Now if you

175
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,000
 know your Bible well, you know there's a parenthetical statement that comes right after this that

176
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,160
 says, "His parents didn't realize that God was going to use this to free them from the

177
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,360
 Philistines." I want you to know I've read lots of commentaries on that statement. And

178
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,920
 they all said, "This is not God commanding Samson to break his law. This is God using

179
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,880
 and redeeming his disobedience of breaking God's law." So Samson was not to marry a Philistine

180
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,320
 woman, but in his rebellion, God is even going to use that. God can use your rebellion. That's

181
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,200
 true. God will bring about his will through your pain if you run from him. That's true.

182
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,380
 Tommy talked about that last week. And so God is purifying his people. He's setting

183
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,040
 them apart, and he's increasing them. This is really important. This is a key strategy

184
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,560
 to God's plan for the world. This is the first Great Commission. And if we can get this,

185
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,000
 this is really important. This is why we get married. This is why God, who could have created

186
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,720
 this plan, any idea. I mean, he could have made it where you were all the same sex, and

187
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,360
 he could have made it where you hold hands and reproduce, and the same kind of thing

188
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,280
 comes forth. He could have done it however you want. He could have made babies come out

189
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,000
 your eyes when you look at elephants. I don't know. He could have done anything he wanted

190
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,680
 to do. He's God. And the way that he did it, and the way that I know you're distracted

191
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,520
 by my craziness. Come back with me. The way that he did it is he said, "You love me, and

192
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,120
 you love me. And when y'all come together and love each other with me at the foundation

193
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,080
 of that, you're going to produce little people, and I want you to raise those little people

194
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,440
 up to love me." And that's my plan. It's the first Great Commission. It shows up in Genesis

195
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,780
 chapter 9, verse 7. "As for you, my people, be fruitful and increase in number. Multiply

196
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:33,960
 on the earth and increase upon it." And you say, "But this book, it says so little about

197
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:40,720
 dating and so little about marriage." You're right. So little. Like honestly, if we looked

198
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,200
 at it, I mean, that's about all of it says in marriage, this whole book. Because this

199
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:54,760
 book is about another relationship. Candidly, this life is about another relationship. This

200
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:02,280
 life is about you knowing God who put you here to know him and make him known. Samson

201
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:08,560
 had this incredible calling on his life. God brought him into the world to free his people,

202
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:14,300
 but he continues to get distracted by these relationships, following his heart, following

203
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:19,720
 his lust, following his feelings, following his desires, and forsaking the Lord's plan

204
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,440
 for his life. And you and I, we do the exact same thing. You have a purpose, and some of

205
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:32,040
 the relationships that you enter in will get in the way of that purpose. Specifically,

206
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,680
 relationships with non-believers, relationships with people who do not follow Christ. 2 Corinthians

207
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,360
 6, verse 14 and 15 says, "Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness

208
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,220
 and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? What harmony

209
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:52,160
 is there between Christ and Belial or Satan? Or what does a believer have in common with

210
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:59,600
 an unbeliever?" Some of the most difficult conversations I have happen right up here,

211
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,800
 usually with the young women, with these huge crocodile tears welling up in their eyes,

212
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,640
 saying, "I'm dating a non-Christian, and I just don't know, but I love him, and I just

213
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,320
 was curious." And I'm always surprised by that, because I'm like, "Surely you've heard

214
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,680
 me address this issue. Surely you've written one of the 27 blogs we've written on this

215
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:31,440
 topic." We don't date non-Christians. We believe this book is true. We believe God

216
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,280
 is real, that he has plans for us. And so we wouldn't do that. It's not an evangelism

217
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:44,800
 strategy. It's not anything that we do. And so the other day, I'm here, it's a Sunday,

218
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:50,640
 I was teaching on a Sunday. A guy and girl come up. He's there. She's like, "Hey, I'm

219
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,240
 a Christian. He's not. He's an atheist. What should we do?" And he's about to swing. In

220
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,120
 that conversation, I'm always kind of like this. And I'm like, "Okay, what?" Because

221
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:06,520
 I'm sensing it. It's right hooks coming. And I'm just like, "I mean, you know what you

222
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:12,400
 got to do. You got to break up." And he's like, "What? What are you talking about? You

223
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,200
 don't even know. You don't even know our relationship. You don't even know what we do. You don't

224
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,480
 know how I love her. You don't know how good I am to her." "You're right, buddy. I don't,

225
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:27,080
 but I care about you. Yes, you. And I want you to know that she believes, she's saying

226
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:33,800
 the biggest thing about my life, the most important thing in the world to me is this

227
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:40,440
 deity that I'm pursuing with my all." And you don't want her to drag you through life

228
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,840
 with that. Like what's going to happen when you guys have kids and y'all disagree on discipline

229
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:50,440
 and she comes with Proverbs and says, "Well, the Proverbs say, 'Spare the rod, spoil the

230
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,080
 child.'" You'd be like, "What are you talking about? Proverbs. Why am I going to try to

231
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,480
 live my life by the Proverbs? What difference? Who's the Proverbs? That's the Bible." And

232
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,200
 she, Sunday comes and she's like, "Well, hey, I'm going to go to church and worship." "Why

233
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,440
 are you always doing that? Let's just watch football." And she's, you know, and you think,

234
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,080
 "Oh, it's going to be fine." And then y'all get into a disagreement. She says, "Well,

235
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,200
 the Bible says." And you're like, "Throw the Bible out the window. Who cares? Y'all are

236
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,280
 going two different directions to two different destinations." You're saying, "Hey, I'm driving

237
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,960
 down the road this way." And then all of a sudden you're going to be like, "Hey, it's

238
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,160
 your turn to drive." And then he gets in the car and he's going to U-turn it and say, "No,

239
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,920
 we're going this way." And then all of a sudden it's your turn to drive. He's like, "You turn

240
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,880
 it." "No, we're going this way." And then he, "No, this way." That doesn't work for

241
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,120
 you. It's never worked out for anyone in the history of 10 years of vocational ministry.

242
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:39,160
 I've never met a single person who says, "Hey, I love God with all my heart. He doesn't believe

243
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:45,320
 in God. We have a healthy marriage and it's fantastic." It's never happened.

244
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,360
 And so the only reason I tell you that is because I care about you. I'm okay to be the

245
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:55,800
 bad guy. I'm okay if you hate me. I care about you. It's not going to go well for you. You

246
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:08,680
 won't be the first person in the history of history that that goes well for. That's all.

247
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:17,880
 Can you be madly in love with someone who does not love God? Can you be madly in love

248
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,520
 with someone who does not love God? And the answer is yes. Madly. Head over heels. Can't

249
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,200
 sleep at night. Wake up early in the morning thinking about them. Can't eat because you're

250
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,760
 so crazy about them in love. Who doesn't love God? Because that's what people will tell

251
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,840
 me. They'll say, "But you don't know how much I love him." I'm like, "I'm sure he's a handsome

252
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,520
 guy. I'm sure you love him a whole lot, but it doesn't matter how you feel. I'm telling

253
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,960
 you what God says." "Well, God wouldn't have given me these feelings if he didn't want

254
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:51,480
 me." God didn't give you those feelings. MTV did or something. I don't know. "But I love

255
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:57,400
 him." Clearly you love him. Clearly you do. You love him more than you love God. You sure

256
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,760
 do because you're willing to compromise God's work to pursue him. I do not question your

257
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:10,120
 love for him. Clearly you love him. And so should you date someone just because they

258
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:16,240
 are a Christian? Absolutely not. Because they have a Bible. Because they go to church. No

259
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,240
 way. Because they memorized scripture. Graduated from seminary. No. No, no, no. Do you know

260
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:27,800
 Samson in this story? I mean, Samson knows God. Samson's a train wreck. Samson would

261
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:35,400
 ruin your life. You know this guy. You know this guy. We all know this guy. He's big,

262
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,880
 swole. He's CrossFit every week. His Insta feed is full of selfies of him in the mirror

263
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,080
 flexing. He's got the big tap out shirt. He does MMA on the weekends. He's the guy that

264
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,920
 your mama said you don't want to like him, but you just kind of do. You see the sensitive

265
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:57,360
 side in him. He cries at romantic comedies. You're like, "There's something about him

266
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,600
 though, Mom." And you know you're not supposed to like him, but you kind of do like him.

267
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,320
 And he's just a bad boy. He walks in the room and honestly he can kick anyone's butt. And

268
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:12,800
 you're like, "Oh man. You know, I just, I don't like that. It's so messy." The heart

269
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:26,600
 wants what it wants, you know. Thank you, Selena Gomez. He will mess you up, man. He

270
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:33,160
 will mess. He will take your heart and wring it out. Get you to like and fall in love with

271
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:44,080
 him for fun. For fun, for his own entertainment. He will mess you up. This guy will. He's a

272
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:54,600
 train wreck. Train wreck of an individual. Do girls like bad boys? Dumb girls do. Let

273
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:08,200
 me, okay, can you email me? Before you email me, let me say it differently. Uneducated

274
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:15,320
 girls do. Girls that don't understand God's desires for them do. Girls that don't realize

275
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,400
 that God wants something better for them, they like bad boys. Their hearts long for

276
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,720
 that. They fed their hearts to that trash drama. They chase the drama, chase the bad

277
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,400
 boy. And you get addicted to it and all you like is bad boys. It's all you know. You've

278
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:37,280
 tasted something you like and you just keep chasing it. Yeah. So let me ask a question

279
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:45,480
 the guys asked. So should I, so what if there's this girl who just loves Jesus so much, man.

280
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,600
 She's amazing and she's always in the Word and girls respect her and they follow her

281
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,000
 and she, you know, Christ is her priority but I'm just not attracted to her. Should

282
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:03,720
 I date her? No. No. Here's why. You're not spiritually mature enough to. You're not spiritually

283
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,640
 mature enough to date her. Let me explain to you what, you haven't learned to be attracted

284
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,800
 to the things that God's attracted to. Remember when he says that when Eliab, David's brother,

285
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,280
 is like handsome and a foot taller than everybody else and big and swole and God says, no, look

286
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,400
 at the heart. That's what I'm drawn to is the heart of an individual. Give me the shepherd

287
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,400
 boy in the field that everyone has overlooked. So no, you shouldn't date her. She's way too

288
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,600
 good for you. That's why you're not attracted to her. You're not spiritually mature enough

289
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,640
 yet to be attracted to her. But what if only like, what if the guys that asked me out are

290
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,840
 the good guys that I just, I just don't like, you know, that like all the good guys asked

291
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:48,640
 me out, but that's just not really what I'm into. Yeah. You got a spiritual maturity problem.

292
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,840
 You keep praying, keep pursuing God's word. I pray that he would change. Don't look at

293
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,480
 porn. Don't don't chase the things of this world and begin to feed your heart the things

294
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:05,600
 of God and he'll change your taste to something healthy and beautiful and full of life and

295
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:12,560
 amazing. So let me just show you how much of a wreck train wreck Samson is who knows

296
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:19,000
 God he knows God. Okay. So he meets this woman and uh, and so he tells his parents and so

297
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,360
 him and his Papa, you know, they're going to go back and get her. And it says, it says

298
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,160
 in the scriptures, by the way, it's about to get weird. Okay. This lion comes up on

299
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:32,400
 him and it says that Samson grabs the lion and tears him apart like a small goat, to

300
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,400
 which I'm like, that still sounds hard. Like I, I don't know when the last time you tore

301
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,480
 apart a small goat, but I'm like, I don't even know what's more difficult. I mean, the

302
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,800
 lion, I guess fights back, but I'm like, that's crazy. Okay. And so then he goes and he meets

303
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,760
 her and he, he talks and he runs his game and then he goes back to his house and then

304
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,600
 he's going to like, Hey, I'm going to go back and I'm going to marry this woman. And so

305
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,800
 he's walking that same path and he's walking the path. He sees the lion carcass, the dead

306
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,520
 body, but remember he's not supposed to go near a dead body, but he sees bees all around

307
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,800
 it and there's a beehive in it, honey in the lion carcass. Okay. It's about to get gross.

308
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,360
 And he goes and he gets the honey, he eats some, and then he gets some and he goes and

309
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,120
 gives it to everybody else. He's broken number one of his Nazirite vow. He's played with

310
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,280
 played with dead things. It's gross. He ate honey out of it. That's gross. Okay. And then

311
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:21,200
 he goes there and he throws this big party, but in the Hebrew it's called a Mishda, which

312
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,920
 literally in the Hebrew translates a drinking party or a party for drinking. Okay. So Samson

313
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,480
 throws a kegger that's Nazirite vow breaking number two, right? He's doing keg stands at

314
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,440
 the party. We don't know. It doesn't say that, but, but he goes, he throws a drinking party.

315
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,320
 He's close to it at least. Right. And then at this party, he's given these 30 command

316
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,840
 companions to accompany him and he tells them a riddle and I'll just read it to you. Verse

317
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,440
 12. Let me tell you a riddle. Samson said to them, if you can give me the answer within

318
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:54,080
 seven days of the feast, I will give you 30 linen garments and 30 sets of clothes. If

319
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,640
 you can't tell me the answer, you must give me 30 linen garments and 30 sets of clothes.

320
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,080
 And here's the riddle out of the eater, something to eat out of the strong, something sweet.

321
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,460
 Okay. What is he doing? He's talking about the lion and he's making light of his sin.

322
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,680
 He knows what he's done and he's like, let's just have some fun with it. He doesn't want

323
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,160
 to keep his sins secret. Like he kind of wants to reveal it through this riddle and he's

324
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,480
 having fun with it. He's making light of it. And he's a thrill seeker. He's that guy. And

325
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,040
 so he's like, Hey, we're at this party and I'm supposed to be getting married. Let's

326
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:26,440
 gamble. Anybody want to gamble? And this is a boring, like you have a party drinking that.

327
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:33,400
 Okay. I got a bet. And he does that. Why? We know this guy. We know this guy. And so,

328
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,320
 okay. So the guys, these 30 companions, they go to his wife and they say, Hey, if you don't

329
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,200
 tell us, if you don't tell us what, um, what the answer to the riddle is, we're going to

330
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,640
 burn you and your father up alive. We're gonna set you on fire. It just got real. And so,

331
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,920
 you know, she tells them he, she nags him, Hey, tell me the answer. Tell me the answer.

332
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,680
 Tell me the answer. He eventually does. Uh, she tells the men, the men tell him, you know,

333
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:04,320
 what is stronger than a lion? What is sweeter than honey? He's angry. This is what he says.

334
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:11,280
 Verse 18. If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have solved my riddle. Okay.

335
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:19,600
 So this is great dating advice. Listen, dude calls you a heifer. You run like if we just,

336
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,520
 if we just knew that if anybody looks at you and says, you're a heifer, you say, peace

337
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,800
 out. I'm out. I went to that dating talk and I'm done with you in the Hebrew that literally

338
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:34,520
 says if you had not plowed with my heifer. Okay. So I'm just like one, don't ever plow

339
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:40,920
 with another man's heifer and two, don't ever call the women a heifer. And so then he leaves

340
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:45,000
 there. He kills 30 innocent men, takes their clothes so he can pay his debt because he's

341
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,760
 Samson. He does whatever he wants to do. He's arrogant. He's narcissistic. He goes back

342
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:59,920
 then to sleep with his wife, but her dad gives, has given her to another man, one of his companions.

343
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,920
 He's upset. So he burns down their crops. This is the Philistines. This is the enemies

344
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:10,440
 of God. He burned down, he burns down their crops at harvest time, which is a big deal,

345
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,720
 man. Like you don't have any food to eat. And so they take his wife and they set her

346
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:22,760
 on fire and her dad, they burn her, make her a Alicia Keys song. That's not even right,

347
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:31,880
 dude. Don't even think about that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's, that's not cool. Um, because

348
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:39,280
 you did this, he says, because you did this, but isn't that weird that he says that, but

349
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:45,160
 he did this. He brought all this drama on himself. Like this was his stupidity. This

350
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,440
 is his fault. Like this guy's the, always the victim. Like, man, they just don't understand

351
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,640
 me that they did this. I'm like, dude, you're, you made a bunch of terrible decisions because

352
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,440
 you did this. And then he has to kill a thousand of them, which is crazy with a donkey bone.

353
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,600
 He kills a thousand of them with a, with a jawbone of a donkey. He's a bad dude. I told

354
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,640
 you that. And so let me just recap. Cause that was a lot. We're still in 0.1 by the

355
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:14,280
 way, disobedient to God's laws. Okay. He's vain. He's made light of a sin. He's rude.

356
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:19,440
 He's violent. He does what he wants. He's vengeful. He's angry. He's a bad dude. And

357
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,120
 so let me just summarize all of that and say, all of those are qualities you want to avoid

358
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,440
 when dating. Don't go after that person. But then what it says in the text is he then has

359
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,880
 20 years where he leads Israel. And so he leads Israel under the Philistine range, uh,

360
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,040
 rain, he kind of comes up and he says, okay, I'm your leaders. Now I'm going to protect

361
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,880
 you from the Philistines. And so judges 15 verse 20, Samson led Israel for 20 years in

362
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,240
 the days of the Philistines. And that's, that's the end of chapter 15. And then the beginning

363
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:54,720
 of chapter 16 says this one day, Samson went to Gaza where he saw a prostitute. He went

364
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,720
 in to spend the night with her. The people of Gaza were told Samson is here. So they

365
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,080
 surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They made no move

366
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:12,480
 during the night saying at dawn, we will kill him. Girl. Number two, prostitute dating detour.

367
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,240
 Number two, giving into lust. You've given to lust. It's going to take you the wrong

368
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:27,000
 direction. So Samson goes from Zora to Gaza, which is 40 miles. Okay. And so I did the

369
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,880
 math of 40 miles. That's 80,000 steps, 80,000. One of these walking into sin, I'm doing it

370
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,120
 consciously. There might be a prostitute there. I might get lucky. I might be able to buy

371
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:47,160
 sex for myself and experience pleasure. And so he walks in the direction of sin slowly

372
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:54,360
 for 40 miles. Samson continues to make decisions based on the pursuit of his own personal pleasure.

373
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:00,200
 And these people make miserable spouses because they do what they want, regardless of what

374
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:08,800
 God says. And it never goes well for them. They are selfish. He did all of this to use

375
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,560
 a girl for sex. People will go to great lengths when they're controlled by their sexual desires.

376
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,560
 They will say crazy things. They will sing boys to men songs to you. They will, they

377
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,000
 will do crazy things. Okay. They will look you in the eyes. They will say, but I love

378
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,400
 you so much. They'll say that in a heartbeat. They'll write you poetry to get in your pants.

379
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:35,280
 They will do all kinds of crazy things. I talk to people all the time that are like,

380
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,040
 man, it's just, it's weird. Like every time I go into his apartment, like we just end

381
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:49,720
 up lying down. Cool, man. Stop going into his apartment. Okay. Well, every time we watch

382
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:55,600
 that movie, like it just ends, it just, just gets a little touchy feely. Okay. No more

383
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:02,920
 movies. All right. Whatever is causing the touchy feelyness. Let's not do that. Okay.

384
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,800
 Why not? We can't even be alone then. Awesome. I'm glad we solved that problem together.

385
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,600
 You can't be alone then. That's where you're at. Like y'all can't be alone, you know? And

386
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,500
 so I'm glad we're working together to solve this problem. But as you walk that direction,

387
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,480
 you're going the wrong direction. It's not moving towards healthy marriage. It's moving

388
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,260
 in the direction of unhealthy relationships. And let me just tell you something. If a person

389
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:31,920
 is willing to sleep with you before marriage, it is very likely they do not believe in God.

390
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,400
 Let me say that again. If a person is willing to sleep with you before marriage, it is very

391
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:44,140
 likely that they do not believe in God. Okay. At least their relationship with him is not

392
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:50,000
 healthy. At least they are not yielding to his spirit. His spirit is not alive and active

393
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,400
 in their lives because they are doing, they're following their own spirit, their own sinful

394
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,780
 desires, their own flesh. They are not yielding to the spirit of God. So at very least they

395
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:11,520
 are not spiritually mature enough to be dating material that we saw in point number one.

396
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:18,700
 The only reason someone take off your pants or put their hands up your shirt is because

397
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:26,840
 they do not fear God. They are not afraid of him and they are pursuing one thing. It

398
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,520
 is what they want and they are telling you something really strategic. They are saying,

399
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:38,520
 Hey, I believe sex is fine outside of marriage. And so should we get married, I will continue

400
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,400
 to look for sex outside of marriage because sex outside of marriage is just different

401
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,540
 than sex inside of marriage. And if you grow an appetite for sex outside of marriage, sex

402
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:53,840
 inside of marriage does not satisfy that appetite. And I've had too many people come back to

403
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,880
 me and say, Hey, you were right when you said that. And so I just, I beg you to take my

404
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,320
 word for it. They're communicating something to you. Sex will keep you in the wrong relationship

405
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:14,280
 too long and it will keep you from the right relationship.

406
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:22,960
 First Corinthians six verse 18 and 20 says this, flee, run from, fast from sexual immorality.

407
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,560
 All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually sins against

408
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,480
 their own body. Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit who

409
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,720
 is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own. You were bought at a

410
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:42,440
 price. Therefore honor God with your body. See, if someone is trying to have sex with

411
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,800
 you, if they're attempting to coerce you towards sex, this gets so easy. You need to thank

412
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,240
 them like they have. They have shortened this road trip really quickly. And you just say,

413
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,780
 Hey, let me out of the car and don't call me. Right? And it's that simple. They just

414
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:02,880
 got really easy for you. They're not the one. They're not the person that God would desire

415
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,320
 you to be with. They're not the kind of person. Okay. Because I don't believe there's only

416
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,560
 one person that God desires you to be with. I believe there's lots of people. That's God's

417
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,600
 people. Not a huge amount of people, but a certain amount of people who follow God with

418
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,400
 all their heart, soul, mind, and strength, whom you can spend the rest of your life with.

419
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:27,120
 But it's not that person. And so like, can you imagine, can you imagine if I had a dude

420
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:33,220
 up here and I just told you ladies, I said, Hey, here he is. And, um, and so he's slept

421
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:40,060
 with, um, thousands of women. Uh, it usually happened. This is his period. It's a couple

422
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:44,400
 times a month, but when he does sleep with a woman, it's not just one woman. It's multiple,

423
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:51,160
 like multiple women, like 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 women all at the same time that happens

424
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,560
 several times a month. So for some, sometimes some seasons about once a month, sometimes

425
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,040
 several times a month, like I think you'd be like, man, I'm like, that's just not who

426
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:05,200
 I want to spend the rest of my life with. But that's what pornography does. That's exactly

427
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,800
 what it is. It's how many women or men can I consume with clicks? Lady, I know this is

428
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,800
 your problem too. I'm not naive to that at all. One in three viewers are women. I get

429
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:22,280
 that. How many people can I consume? How many clips, how many steps? So I consume what I

430
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:29,000
 want for my own pleasure. It's adultery with people. They're real people. I mean the two

431
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:37,800
 dimensional kind, but they live and breathe somewhere and you are growing an addiction

432
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,480
 for them, which is not a person. It's not a spouse. It's variety. And one person will

433
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:52,600
 never satisfy someone with an addiction for variety. True story. That's my story. That's

434
00:39:52,600 --> 00:40:05,080
 my story. If you didn't know, I'm not trying to shame you. I'm begging you to make the

435
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:10,920
 last time that you've looked at porn behind you. Like what if like right now you hear

436
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,640
 this and you know I'm talking to you and you say, I'll never look at it again. I'm going

437
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:21,600
 to go home. I will throw my computer through the window. Don't do that. I'll buy it from

438
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:27,920
 you or something, but I will never look at it again. What if, how powerful would that

439
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,960
 be? You never saw it again ever for the rest of your life. You began to heal so that you

440
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,920
 could get married. That'd be a beautiful thing, man. Sexual sin is such a slippery, addictive

441
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,760
 path and it's so hard to stop the car when you're going this direction. Like everything

442
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,240
 in you wants to slam on the brake, pull the parking brake, but you just can't because

443
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,600
 an object in motion stays in motion and you love your sin or you're at least addicted

444
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,560
 to it. And so I saw this in a really real way. This just this week, Susie Faber Hamilton's

445
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,880
 story broke. I don't know if you heard this, but she's a three time Olympian. Okay. And

446
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,160
 so she was, she went to the Olympics three different times. A pretty incredible fast

447
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:11,400
 runner, a sprinter, if you will. And on her 20th wedding anniversary, after the Olympics,

448
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,320
 20th wedding anniversary, she tells her husband, Hey, let's spice things up a little bit. Let's

449
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:20,360
 go to Vegas and have a threesome. So they go to Vegas. I mean, he thinks what an amazing

450
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,040
 gift from my wife that she would do this for me. They go to Vegas, they get a high price

451
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:31,760
 call girl. Okay. And she tastes something that she can't shake. She begins to develop

452
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,880
 an appetite, a sexual addiction. And she says to him, Hey, I think I want to go back to

453
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:43,360
 Vegas this time, not to get a call girl, but to be a call girl. I think I can produce some

454
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:50,600
 extra income this way. I would like to. And she talks about her duplicitous life, duplicitous

455
00:41:50,600 --> 00:42:01,120
 life. She's kids. It's a slippery slope. Why would anybody do this? How does that happen?

456
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:11,760
 Because you feed an appetite and you're feeding an appetite. Just consider who you find attractive.

457
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,240
 Like like just as you watch TV and you're like, Oh man, Channing Tatum. Wow. Here's

458
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:25,400
 what you're not saying. I love how he knows the word Ryan Reynolds. Oh my. You're not

459
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,760
 saying I love the way he walks with Jesus guys. Megan Fox. Wow. I bet she leaves Sunday

460
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,080
 school. That's not what you're saying, right? You're saying, here's what you're saying.

461
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,760
 You're saying, Hey heart, find me one of those. Hey heart, you watch. Are you listening? Did

462
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,320
 you hear me? Did you hear me say, Oh wow. Did you see those abs? Buy me one of those.

463
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:50,400
 That's what you're doing. You've got to be careful guys. You're feeding your heart and

464
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,160
 not just what you watch and what you pursue and what you say, what you listen to just

465
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,600
 this today. What I heard, you know, Demi Lovato cool for the summer. Got my mind on your body

466
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,040
 and your body on my mind. Got a taste for the cherry. I just need to take a bite. Don't

467
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,520
 tell your mother, kiss one another, die for each other. We're cool for the summer. That's

468
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,040
 what Samson is telling this lady. We're cool for the summer. Except they're waiting outside

469
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:19,040
 for me to kill me. Toe low talking body. And I mean, this, this is on repeat in the radio.

470
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,000
 I'm in the car with my little girls and she says, if we're talking bodies, you got to

471
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,280
 have a perfect one. So put it on me. It won't make, take me long. If you love me, right.

472
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:37,080
 We'll on kiss FM on repeat. Well F for life. My little girl's like, what did she say? I'm

473
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:44,160
 like, Don, you should change the station. 97, 94.7. What are we doing? She said, well,

474
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,600
 F for life. This, this young sweet girl. So, Hey, that's the destination I'm traveling

475
00:43:50,600 --> 00:44:01,800
 to. That's what I want. You're being brainwashed. You're being brainwashed. Judges 16, verse

476
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:10,600
 four. Sometime later, Samson, again, he fell in love with the woman in the Valley of Sorek

477
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:16,240
 whose name was Delilah. So the meat head gets the Valley girl. We've seen this happen. So

478
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:21,360
 the rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, see if you can lure him into showing

479
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:26,920
 you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him. So he might tie so that

480
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:32,520
 we might tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you 1100 shekels of silver.

481
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,320
 Let me just remind you, Samson, Israelite Philistines, God's enemies, Delilah. She's

482
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:42,520
 a Philistine. Okay. Samson falls in love with her. The text says, so her Philistine people

483
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,080
 say, Hey, we'll pay you if you can find the secret to his strength. Now this is the story

484
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:51,400
 that you might know. So Delilah said to Samson, tell me the secret of your great strength

485
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:57,680
 and how you can be tied up and subdued because she's a gold digger, right? She wants the

486
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:03,200
 money. And so Samson answered her. If anyone ties me with seven fresh bow strings that

487
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,840
 have not been dried, I'll become as weak as any other man. Then the rulers of the Philistines

488
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:13,400
 brought her seven fresh bow strings that had not been dried. And she tied them up with

489
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,640
 them. She tied him up with them with men hidden in the room. She called him Samson. The Philistines

490
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,920
 are upon you, but he snapped the bow strings as easily as pieces as a piece of a string

491
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,760
 snaps when it comes close to a flame. So the secret of his strength was not discovered.

492
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,560
 Okay. Then she keeps doing this. Samson, Samson, you made a fool of me. You've got to tell

493
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,840
 me the secret of your strength. How can I bound you? He says, Hey, if you tie me with

494
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,920
 fresh ropes, so she grabs fresh ropes and she ties them up while he's sleeping. Like

495
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,200
 this is all kinds. This is 50 shades of crazy. You know, I don't know what's going on. And

496
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,720
 so she did. She's like, Samson, the Philistines are coming. He gets up, breaks the ropes.

497
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,720
 He says, Samson, you made a fool of me again. What must I do? She says, well, if you take

498
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,160
 the seven braids of my hair and you weave them up in a weaver's loom and tie it with

499
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,880
 a tight pin, I don't even know what that means. And you know, then I won't be strong. She

500
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,720
 does it while he's sleeping. Hey, Samson, the Philistines, he gets up, breaks loose.

501
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:13,120
 Samson, what's your problem? You've made a fool of me yet again. Don't you love me? If

502
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:18,920
 anybody ever tries to use love to get you to do something, let that be a red flag to

503
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:27,440
 run. Don't you love me? I mean, I would be like, Hey, first of all, why do you keep tying

504
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:38,160
 me up at night? I mean, this dude is not the wisdom of Solomon here. I mean, something's

505
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:45,720
 wrong. Then she said to him, how can you say I love you when you won't confide in me? This

506
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,080
 is the third time you have made a fool of me and haven't told me the secret of your

507
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:55,360
 great strength. With such nagging, she prodded him day after day until he was sick to death

508
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:01,040
 of it. And he eventually tells her, you cut my hair, which will be the third time he's

509
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,040
 broke his Nazarite vow. And the spirit of God leaves him. The strength of the Lord leaves

510
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:12,680
 him and it leads to his death. It leads to his destruction. But that's not all in his

511
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:18,880
 rear view mirror is death and destruction. He's killed a woman. He's seen his wife lit

512
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,960
 on fire, which we made a joke about, but honestly, it's not funny. Like if you can imagine if

513
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:30,600
 that happened, just the weight of that, I mean, it would be insane. He's used a woman

514
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:36,480
 for his own pleasure. And then he's had this relationship that is based completely and

515
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,000
 totally on games. And that's my detour number three. And we'll wrap up dating detour number

516
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,280
 three, playing games. He's a thrill seeker, Samson. He likes riddles about sins and secrets

517
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:54,640
 kept and prostitutes and fights. He's a thrill seeker and thrill seekers attract thrill seekers.

518
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,400
 And so he's met his match in Delilah. See people who take advantage of people eventually

519
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,640
 find people who take advantage of people, people who take advantage of people, eventually

520
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:10,640
 attract people who take advantage of people, Samson's vein. And let me just tell you this,

521
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,720
 this really profound thought for you. Vain people attract vain people. You, you, you

522
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:20,560
 track with me. I go to the gym. I'm hot. I'm not me. I'm just figuratively speaking. I'm

523
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:25,160
 hot. I work out. I do creatine the whole deal. Right? I'm flexing. I'm strong. Right. And

524
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,400
 you're smoking hot and you go to the gym and we got the gym in common and you know what?

525
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:35,920
 You like me. And I liked that you like me cause I like me and we found each other. We're

526
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,200
 cool for the summer. Right? I mean, that's, that's, that's how that works is, Hey, there

527
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,640
 we are. Right? You're vain. I'm vain. We're vain. We can be vain together. Vain people

528
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:48,640
 attract vain people because the reason that I'm vain is because I think this is what you

529
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,520
 want. And the reason I'm this way is so I can attract you. So I take care of myself

530
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,080
 like this. Not like health, you know, not like God honoring health, but like, no, no,

531
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:04,160
 no, no. I want to be something that you would worship because I'm something that I worship.

532
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,600
 And so I want you to worship me and I'll worship you and we can worship each other for a season

533
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:18,320
 because it only lasts for a season. Vanity is this deep, shallow. And that's the danger.

534
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:25,360
 When we feed our hearts, pornography, we've conditioned our hearts, what to look for.

535
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:31,340
 And so when you have climaxed with a porn star over and over and over and over again,

536
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:35,920
 you eventually, you want to be with a porn star. That's what you want. The problem is

537
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:47,480
 that that's usually really unhealthy. And by usually really, I mean always and absolutely.

538
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:53,240
 So it's not real. I mean, even though the text clearly used words like in love with,

539
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,920
 it's not real. He's Samson. He's grown addicted to something counterfeit. Like that. That's

540
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,280
 the problem is he's fed his heart prostitutes. He's fed his heart, this woman that he didn't

541
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,720
 know that he saw from far away. So of course he's going to be attracted to Delilah, who's

542
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,800
 beautiful, but a complete and total con. And so you're here and you're like, man, you don't

543
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,320
 even know. I don't even need this series, man. I got game. You don't even know my game.

544
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,560
 Like I got game, like, like the opposite sex, not even a problem. I know how to talk to

545
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,400
 him. I know how to be with him. I know how to get them to do whatever I want. You're

546
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:31,000
 right. You do that game. All you got is game. And you have no idea how to do anything real.

547
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 And when you get stuck into a relationship that you think you might want to stay in and

548
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,640
 you walk down an aisle and you stand at an altar and you say crazy things to one another,

549
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:46,040
 you're going to get into a marriage and you're going to miss that game. And your kids are

550
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:50,520
 going to hate you because you play games and your spouse is going to hate you because they're

551
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:58,880
 going to realize your whole life is a game. It's a sham. See also a joke. I'd stop playing

552
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:07,000
 games if I were you. Romans tells us that love must be sincere. You don't have game.

553
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:13,400
 You're a joke. You're a boy. You're a little girl that never learned how to love. You don't

554
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:22,160
 have game. You're playing with dolls. You're playing games. You don't have game. It's going

555
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:32,240
 to hurt you. And God has something better for you. So the man who could have had anyone

556
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:39,040
 never had anyone because he was never going the right direction. He will die alone. Not

557
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:45,080
 having never been married, no, that would be much better than how he dies. He's been

558
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:50,080
 married. In fact, as he looks in his rearview mirror, all he sees is relationships that

559
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,160
 are shattered. It might be what some of you see when you look in your rearview mirror.

560
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,000
 Like honestly, every relationship you've ever had up until this point didn't go so well

561
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,480
 probably. Okay. And so when you look in your rearview mirror, you're like, wow, I might

562
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,040
 not be very good at this thing. Remember the first thing I asked you to do? Realize, man,

563
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:15,240
 we may not be very good at this. We may have to learn another way. But there's this incredible

564
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:21,400
 rhythm in this text I just want to show you and then we'll leave. We'll we'll end. It's

565
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,440
 this rhythm that when Samson is, he only does it a few times, but when he turns to God,

566
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:30,240
 God is right there and he answers his cry. It's this beautiful thing. In fact, in the

567
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,880
 text it says, you know, we lost his strength. It actually says God's grace. It says his

568
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:38,920
 hair grew back, which is just God's incredible grace in his life. There's a few times where

569
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,640
 one time where he's thirsty after he slayed a thousand men and it says he turned to God

570
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:50,120
 in his time of need and God provided water for him. God is so merciful, no longer counting

571
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:56,200
 your sins against you. He's waiting for you to turn. You're still walking those 70,000

572
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:02,920
 steps to Gaza. And he says, Hey, will you just turn around? Will you just return to

573
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:11,480
 me in the form of repentance? Say, I'm going to do this the right way from here on out.

574
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:18,280
 And so in summary, only date people who are fully surrendered to Christ. In summary, don't

575
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:29,720
 fall into the lust trap. And in summary, don't play games, but be sincere. Dating someone

576
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:33,840
 can be the best or worst thing that ever happened to you. One of the best and worst things I

577
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:39,520
 should say. I mean, if you date someone that is fully yielded to God and, and loves God

578
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,280
 more than you and wants to care for you in the way that God has commanded them to, that

579
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:50,440
 can be a really beautiful thing. Um, when you date someone like Samson or Delilah or

580
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:58,640
 this prostitute or the girl from Timna, it doesn't go well. You go in the wrong direction

581
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,400
 and you may not even know it. You don't know if you're like, am I going to marriage? Am

582
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:09,360
 I not? And you're driving away from a healthy marriage and you don't even realize it. When

583
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:13,120
 I was in high school, I was graduating, graduating senior. I was dating this girl. She was a

584
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:19,640
 sophomore or junior rather. And, um, and because we were in a relationship and because we were

585
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:23,920
 in love, let me just say, first of all, how stupid it is to date in high school because

586
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,280
 nobody in high school wants to get married and we date to get married. And so how dumb

587
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:33,080
 is that? And I realized that now, but we're in this relationship and we are in love with

588
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:37,040
 each other. And so she graduates early. I mean, she loses a year of her high school

589
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:45,720
 life. And she goes three hours away to a community college, which doesn't even make sense so

590
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:52,760
 that we could be in the same town. And our relationship is extremely physical, not God

591
00:54:52,760 --> 00:55:03,120
 honoring I'm verbally and emotionally abusive to this young woman. And it dawned on me while

592
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:09,720
 I was reading this text this week, studying the life of Samson. I just, I wanted badly

593
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:14,760
 to be in front of her in the most appropriate way and beg her forgiveness and her husband's

594
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:22,320
 forgiveness and her children's forgiveness. I just, I wanted that so badly this week when

595
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:31,760
 we broke up. Um, cause of course we broke up and she tried to take her life. I mean,

596
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:38,440
 because our whole world was wrapped up in that relationship. And I thought at a risk

597
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:45,560
 of sounding prideful, I thought I was the worst thing that ever happened to her. Like

598
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:52,840
 the worst thing that she ever did in her years of existence was cross my path. And I had

599
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:57,320
 to carry that. And what's crazy is when I was in that, we were just having fun for the

600
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:05,040
 summer, man. It was just fine. Laughs. You use me, I'll use you. It's just fine. And

601
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:09,880
 I never thought about the reality of the future that I'm going to look at her with all of

602
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:15,080
 this deep regret and hurt and this feeling of remorse and realize that she's going to

603
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:19,640
 have a family and a husband. Then there's going to be deep, deep emotional wounds that

604
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:28,480
 she's going to carry with her her entire life, which I'm responsible for.

605
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:34,480
 Some of you, you realize in there right now that that's happened to you or that you've

606
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:44,440
 been a part of it. And I'm begging you to turn around to repent, to say, God, I have

607
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:51,080
 not dated as you've asked me to date. I have not gone about that. I've been informed by

608
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:56,000
 the world more than I've been informed by anything else out there. And more than I've

609
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:04,280
 been informed by you, I've done what I wanted to do. But God, I believe in you and I believe

610
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:11,680
 you love me and I believe you know better than I do. So I repent. I'm going to turn

611
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:19,000
 around and I'm going to do this your way. Whenever we go somewhere, whenever we travel

612
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,360
 somewhere, we say this, there's this saying that this has become a part of our culture,

613
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:27,080
 leave it better than you found it. When we go to Sky Ranch for lunch, we say, hey, leave

614
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:31,760
 it better than you found it, which just means clean up after yourself and make it better.

615
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:36,780
 Be a blessing to this place. And that's how you should date. Leave the person better than

616
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:43,960
 you found them. When I look in my rearview mirror, not the case. I'm like Samson. There's

617
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:50,000
 rubble piled up all over the side of the road. I've been driving the wrong direction down

618
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:58,800
 the freeway wondering why everybody's a bad driver. And it's awful. So when you date someone,

619
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:10,760
 leave them better than you found them. And repent. Let me pray. Father, we repent. God,

620
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:20,300
 forgive me for, please forgive me for where I've made light of this serious story that

621
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:25,300
 you've preserved in the text, not to teach us solely about dating, but to teach us about

622
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:31,060
 your character, your grace and your mercy, and how you raise up an individual to do amazing

623
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:37,500
 things in spite of our wickedness and our sin in spite of us. Father, if only Samson

624
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:48,660
 had repented, if only Samson had turned from his ways at the woman at Timna or at the prostitute

625
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:54,980
 or at any places of his life, if he would have just turned and turned back to you. Father,

626
00:58:54,980 --> 00:59:04,620
 would you make right now our moment. We commit to you purity, God. I and some of my friends

627
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:14,140
 here commit to you to never look at pornography again. That the next breast we see will be

628
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:22,460
 that of our wives, that the next man we lust after would be our husband. God, we commit

629
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:29,180
 to you purity in our relationship, that as we date, Father, that we would stop short

630
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:34,620
 of our body preparing itself for sex as you've designed it to do. That we would honor each

631
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:41,140
 other like a brother or a sister until we stand before you in the covenant, ready to

632
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:45,540
 make the covenant of marriage. And Father, for us, this is going to be really difficult

633
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,860
 for some of us because it's like slamming on the brakes of something that we've been

634
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:54,420
 driving down the freeway 110 miles per hour. And we can't do it without the help of your

635
00:59:54,420 --> 01:00:00,780
 spirit. So would you aid us in that? Would you help us in that, God? Thank you that you're

636
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:07,460
 a merciful God, that you hear these prayers. We love you in Christ's name. Amen.

637
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:13,060
 Because I've done this message before, not this exact one, but I've done this long enough

638
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:16,460
 that I don't know what to know. I mean, people come up and they say, "Man, I just felt so

639
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:24,460
 condemned. Man, I just felt so guilty." And so listen, lean in, hear me, okay? This is

640
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:31,100
 my story. I experienced the redemptive work of Jesus Christ in my own life. He has set

641
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:36,260
 me free from sexual sin. I'm not saying there's not temptation, okay? I'm not saying that

642
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:41,500
 I don't ever lust after a woman, but when I do, I go through the act of repentance,

643
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:49,740
 which includes confession to God and to other men in my life, to my wife, sometimes my children.

644
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:53,840
 Then I turn and I say, "I don't want to do that. God, help me." And things that caused

645
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:59,020
 me to struggle, I remove from my life. And I have experienced his redemptive work. It's

646
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:07,260
 real. I'm not deceived. I am not under some spell. I'm not whacked out. I'm a logical

647
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:14,580
 guy. And so if you're here and you're like, "Man, I've got to make changes." Make changes.

648
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:20,220
 It starts like this. "God, I need to make changes." If you're in a relationship, I know

649
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:25,660
 it's unbelievably awkward for you. I'm glad you're here. And so find someone, you find

650
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:30,020
 someone with a red shirt, and I'm just going to give you the script. Ready? You ready?

651
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:34,500
 We're having sex. We'll take it from there. We'll take it from there. You find someone

652
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:38,220
 with a red shirt that says the portion. I say, "Hey, we're having sex. And we'll drive

653
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:43,980
 from there. We'll pray with you. We're not going to throw stones at you. Okay? We're

654
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:49,020
 not going to hurt you. We're going to talk to you. We're going to study the scriptures

655
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:53,540
 together." Okay, you're here. You've been looking at porn. Guys, girls, I know you're

656
01:01:53,540 --> 01:02:01,620
 here. Tons of hundreds of you. Okay? Find a guy, person, red shirt, same sex. They've

657
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:06,580
 been looking at pornography. We have that conversation every single week, sadly. And

658
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:10,740
 we are ready and prepared to have it with you tonight. I've been looking at porn. We'll

659
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:16,700
 pray with you. We'll pray for God's restorative work in your life. He will do incredible things

660
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:22,620
 through you. I have no, I mean, it'll be awesome because He takes the will. He'll take the

661
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:27,820
 will and when He tries, I mean, He's just really good at taking you to amazing places.

662
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:34,700
 Much better than you are. Much better than you are. Yeah, that excites me. Could you

663
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:42,540
 imagine if 2,500 of us left this place and got dating, right? That would just be incredible.

664
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:50,340
 I'd do all your weddings. It'd be awesome. It'd be awesome. David would do some. I just

665
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:54,620
 got some announcements, okay? We do have open community group tonight. So what that means

666
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:58,980
 is if you're looking for community, you realize I don't have anyone to be accountable with

667
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:02,660
 or to hold me accountable. I just want to hear more about what fellowship in the church

668
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:08,520
 looks like. Guys walk down this aisle or this little pathway here and there's a room. Girls

669
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,900
 walk down this pathway and there's a room and it's full of people who are right where

670
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:15,900
 you're at saying, "Hey, I'm just looking to meet other Christians and go through life

671
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:21,180
 together." If you're interested in going to Haiti with us, we have an information gathering

672
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:25,660
 right now in the loft. So when you leave here, just go upstairs to that building. I'm pointing

673
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:29,060
 at it. It's up and over. That's the loft. You can go in there and say, "I'd love to

674
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:35,020
 hear more about going to Haiti," particularly if you're a Watermark member.

675
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:39,980
 And then lastly, I don't know that I've ever given a homework assignment, but I'm going

676
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:45,180
 to. Did you guys like Samson? Do you like that story? Good. Three of you really like

677
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:50,220
 that story. So I'm glad it's the four of us. So the rest of you are going to read it. That's

678
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:55,180
 the homework assignment. I would love for you to read the story of Samson. So judges

679
01:03:55,180 --> 01:04:01,260
 13, 14, 15, and 16. So just leave here and read the story of his life. And I think we'll

680
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:07,020
 probably talk about it again next week because it's rich. Judges 13, 14, 15, and 16. That's

681
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:11,580
 your homework. And ready for this? I'd love to hear your biggest takeaway. And so just

682
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:15,940
 tweet at me after you've read those chapters. Tweet at me and say, "Hey, this was my takeaway,"

683
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:19,860
 or "This is what stood out to me." And we're going to use hashtag. You guys ready? This

684
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:24,100
 is either the worst idea or the best idea I've ever had, but we're going to do hashtag

685
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:31,060
 STD porch. Okay. And so I just figured the world might look at that and be curious. And

686
