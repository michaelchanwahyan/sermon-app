[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   (phone ringing)
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.380]   - You have seven unheard messages.
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.040]   - Hey, sorry I haven't texted.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.120]   I'm just not really sure what I'm feeling right now.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.580]   - Hey, yo Danny!
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.260]   Where you at, bro?
[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.080]   I'll see you soon, all right?
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.200]   - Hey, so I have moved on,
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.560]   but I feel like the Lord keeps putting you back
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.800]   on my heart for a reason.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.480]   So please call me back.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.840]   - Hey, bro, hey, I know you're going through it right now,
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.140]   but listen, I found another girl at the farmer's market now.
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.600]   She's not a farmer, but she is on the market, okay?
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.040]   So hit me back, love you, bro.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.800]   - No, I'm sure this is the right number,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.760]   but last night was a mistake.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.680]   I was just hoping we could keep that between us.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.880]   - Hey, just wanted to say,
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.680]   I don't think I can make it tonight.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.960]   Yeah, I've just been thinking about us a lot lately
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.440]   and we need to talk.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.100]   (phone ringing)
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.760]   - All right, Porsche, how are we doing tonight?
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.780]   You doing okay?
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.120]   It's great to see you.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.840]   If you've been here before, welcome back.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.440]   And if you are new to the room,
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.700]   let me be hopefully not the first,
[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.320]   but one among many who says we're so glad
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.360]   you're here with us.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.500]   Everyone that is in Dallas, it's amazing to be with you,
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.880]   but it is also amazing to be with everybody
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.120]   that is tuning in online.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.640]   We don't take it for granted
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.680]   that young adults all over the nation
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.640]   choose to give up part of their evening
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.800]   here with us on Tuesdays.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.240]   And so thank you, all of you
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.160]   that are listening in on this series
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.600]   and what God is doing.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.780]   We pray it is a blessing to you.
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.960]   And special shout out to all of our Porsche Live locations,
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.080]   particularly Porsche Live Dayton, Fort Worth, and Wheaton.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.540]   So glad to be with you.
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.640]   We're talking about dating, people.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.560]   And tonight is the third week.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.520]   But before we get into it,
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.400]   let me lead off with a story
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.900]   that I think will set us up well.
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.840]   In my last job, when I lived in Houston,
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.800]   prior before I came here to Dallas,
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.080]   I worked in a young singles ministry.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.760]   What I didn't know whenever I took the job
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.760]   is that I inherited a major crisis within the organization.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.560]   It's not what you likely think.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.280]   It wasn't that we had a declining attendance
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.520]   or a lack of giving from our members.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.880]   It's not that I even had personnel issues
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.360]   or we were short-staffed in volunteers.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.840]   We weren't even facing cultural challenges.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.520]   No, no, no, it was something altogether different.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.800]   You see, the major crisis that I inherited
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.940]   whenever I got to Dallas is that no one was dating,
[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.960]   which is a big deal when you consider the fact
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.320]   that I was working in a young singles ministry.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.920]   Like this is a place where people are walking with Jesus
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.200]   and they're trying to connect in the community
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.720]   and they're principally looking for a spouse.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.560]   And so it begged the question in my mind,
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.920]   like why is it that all of you
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.400]   are in the picture-perfect place to find a romantic suitor
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.120]   and yet none of you seem to be doing that?
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.960]   What is the problem?
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.520]   Why is nobody dating?
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.160]   And so unable just to allow the question
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.600]   to be rhetorical in my mind, I started asking around.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.120]   And what I found is that surprisingly,
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.640]   the answers were the same
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.280]   depending upon which group you visited with.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.120]   And so I would ask the ladies, hey, why is nobody dating?
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.740]   And they would always respond with the same thing.
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.160]   They would always say, well, guys just aren't asking us out.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160]   It doesn't matter if I do my hair
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.880]   or if I get my Sunday best on
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.640]   or if I choose to share my Bible with him
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.160]   or I even visit with his friends
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.720]   and try to make nice with the boys
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.200]   or I stamp interested on my forehead.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.600]   He just can't seem to catch the hint.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.600]   To the guys, they would always respond,
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.740]   well, the girls never say yes.
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.000]   Doesn't matter if I confirm
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.160]   that she's single and ready to mingle.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.920]   It doesn't even matter if I plan what I'm gonna say
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.760]   and where I'm gonna say it.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.080]   If I talk to her friends and I make sure,
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.920]   hey, do y'all agree?
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.080]   Is this a good idea?
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.840]   Or if I actually go to the trouble
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.880]   of putting on my Sunday best
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.720]   and making sure my hygiene is in check,
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.920]   it doesn't seem to work.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.280]   Anytime I ask a girl out, it is less remotely romantic.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.920]   Instead, it is more like an extreme sport
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.200]   for my self-esteem.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.480]   Both admitted to wanting the other,
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.800]   but both accused each other for why that wasn't happening,
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.480]   which felt crazy to me
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.120]   because they were all saying the same thing.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.400]   I want you and yet it's your fault
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.240]   that we can't be together.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.420]   That's what they were all communicating.
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.800]   It felt like a really bad soap opera in its 20th season
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.240]   in the sense that it just needed to end.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.520]   Dating didn't need to be this hard.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.960]   At least according to my estimation,
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.240]   it didn't feel like it needed to be.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.440]   And yet, as I started preparing for this message
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.320]   and reading the research,
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.400]   what I learned is most people think it is.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.940]   According to Pew Research,
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.400]   almost half of Americans say dating is harder today
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.200]   than it was 10 years ago,
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.800]   which I don't know about you,
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.920]   but when I hear something like that,
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.200]   it raises the question in my mind,
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.840]   what took place over the course of the last decade
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.200]   that has made the dating dynamic so much more difficult?
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.240]   Well, there's a lot that we could say on that,
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.840]   but when it comes to the realm of romance,
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.480]   there is one primary perpetrator that we need to identify,
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.720]   and it's this, technology.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.920]   Whether it's the fear of being unintentionally catfish,
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.320]   and I mean that, like unintentionally,
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.400]   like you saw their profile on Hinge,
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.120]   and yet then they showed up in the date,
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.960]   and you're like, wait,
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.200]   that photo was like five to 10 years older than you.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.760]   You don't look like that any longer,
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.400]   or it's the pain of trying to decipher,
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.960]   does he like me or doesn't he like me?
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.840]   He continues to like the things that I'm posting online.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.440]   Or it's the trouble and the frustration of,
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.960]   man, my job requires me to travel,
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.800]   and so I work remotely, I'm on the road a lot,
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.840]   and yet as I do that,
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.440]   I feel disconnected from other people,
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.920]   particularly those that I might be romantically interested in.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.280]   I don't know where it is,
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.680]   but what I need you to hear is the same technology
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.280]   that has infiltrated your regular life
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.640]   has infiltrated your romantic life,
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.240]   and the result is it has made your romantic life hard.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.360]   You see, the dating dynamic today
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.000]   can feel like, for lack of a better word, discouraging.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.960]   It is disheartening, no,
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.280]   to go into a series of first dates
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.000]   and feel like you give so much effort
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.360]   and yet walk away from all of them
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.720]   and feel like you got nothing out of them instead.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.060]   It can be deeply confusing to process,
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.760]   how did she become so attached
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.680]   when we've only ever really had like one conversation
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.080]   with one another?
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.000]   It can also be equally infuriating
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.400]   to see that he's more invested
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.720]   in his intramural softball team than he is in you.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.560]   I get it, but what you need to understand
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.980]   is we're all left asking the same question.
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.240]   Is dating supposed to be this hard?
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.560]   Is dating supposed to be this hard?
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.520]   That's where we're going tonight,
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.660]   because cards on the table,
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.240]   I don't think it has to be, nor should it be.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.240]   You see, we often make dating so much harder than necessary,
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.960]   and the reason why
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.180]   is we just don't know what we're doing.
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.660]   Can we admit that to one another,
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.300]   that we might not actually be as familiar
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.740]   with the landscape of love as we claim to be?
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.880]   It's funny, I was preparing for this message
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.280]   and reading through some articles,
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.960]   and I came across one that was titled,
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.100]   "A Guy's Guide to Asking Girl Out."
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.480]   Now, normally that doesn't appeal to me
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.520]   as a credible source for a talk like this.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.660]   And yet I was struck by two things I found very funny.
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.880]   Number one, the title insinuated to me
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.400]   that not only do men need instructions
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.200]   for building that desk at home,
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.320]   they need instructions for building a good opening line
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.480]   whenever it comes to engaging with the opposite sex.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.880]   And the second thing that was very interesting to me
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.740]   is it claimed a 95% success rate.
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.440]   It said, "Hey, this thing is bulletproof, it will work."
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.240]   And so, like a moth to the flame,
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.540]   I pulled back the layers
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.120]   and I started reading through everything
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.480]   this author had said,
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.820]   and what I found was horrible dating advice.
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.400]   And I'm not claiming to be the expert here.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.480]   I'm saying God is, and he disagrees.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.560]   Because when you're reading headlines like,
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.160]   "Hey, keep her confused," or "Don't take no for an answer,"
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.720]   that's not good advice.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.920]   (congregation laughing)
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.920]   And yet, what we can know from that
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.200]   is even the so-called dating experts
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.440]   don't have a clue what they're doing.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.040]   No one knows what they're doing.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.440]   But God does.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.480]   And so over the course of tonight,
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.560]   what I wanna help you do
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.000]   is I wanna help you see what he says
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.840]   and the way that I wanna do it
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.160]   is I wanna give you a series of principles.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.840]   I wanna help you understand the do's and the don'ts of it all
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.020]   but before we really get into it,
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.320]   what you need to hear from me is this warning.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.560]   If all you hear tonight is a bunch of tips and tricks
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.640]   for finding that special someone
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.080]   or how to hack the system unhappily ever after,
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.400]   then you will have wasted your time here tonight.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.640]   You see, values are only so good
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.480]   as the vision that they support.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.860]   And so my goal is to help you get a vision of a God
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.680]   that has built a beauty beneath all of this
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.900]   that transcends things like a great opening line
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.240]   or meeting somebody new or going on that first date
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.920]   or publicly displaying your affection
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.640]   because people actually do enjoy doing that
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.240]   or meeting the parents at some point
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.440]   or bending the knee and proposing the question
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.080]   and sailing off into the sunset with your special someone.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.360]   There's more to it than just those things.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:13.720]   You see, Christ's principles for love,
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.280]   which we're gonna talk about tonight,
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.840]   they can get you a date,
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.160]   but it is Christ's picture of love
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.040]   that will keep you in a relationship.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.600]   You need to see him.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.180]   And so what I wanna do
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.660]   is I wanna walk you through a series of principles.
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.720]   I've got eight of them, which if you know me,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.680]   immediately causes you to panic
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.320]   because I already take too long
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.160]   unpacking three to four principles every single week.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.320]   So we're gonna split this thing into two weeks.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.560]   We got part one tonight, part two next week.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.060]   So if you like what you hear this evening,
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.360]   come back around because we'll have more for you next time.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.960]   We're gonna walk through four principles
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.920]   on the dos and don'ts of dating.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.240]   You guys ready for this?
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:00.240]   The first is this, don't be anxious, but do be dependent.
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.100]   Don't be anxious, but do be dependent.
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:07.940]   What do I mean by that?
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.780]   Well, to depend upon someone is to rely upon that person
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.820]   to fulfill some need that you have.
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.700]   Now, as I say that, this is not a license nor excuse
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.380]   for you to snap into your stage five clinginess
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.020]   and start searching across the four corners
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.100]   of this planet earth to find that person
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.380]   whom your soul has set its affections upon.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.980]   That's not what I'm telling you to do.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.980]   The goal here is not to be needy.
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.260]   You don't need a boyfriend or girlfriend.
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.180]   What you do need is you need Jesus.
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.980]   The scriptures unpack this very clearly.
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.540]   Isaiah 26, four says, "Trust in the Lord forever
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.560]   for the Lord God is an everlasting rock."
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.920]   Meaning that there is stability with him,
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.580]   that a relationship won't necessarily promise you stability
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.100]   but God can promise you stability.
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.900]   He is a rock upon which you can stand.
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.240]   Proverbs 3, five through six says,
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.460]   "Trust in the Lord with all your heart."
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.700]   Not just part of it, but the entirety of it.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.380]   "And do not lean on your own understanding.
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.820]   In all your ways, acknowledge him
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.980]   and he will make straight your paths."
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.240]   Anybody feel like as you navigate
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.860]   the tumultuous road of romance,
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.380]   you often feel like, man, I am weaving
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.740]   and winding all over the place.
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.160]   God is the one as you walk through this life
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.020]   that can make your path straight.
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.340]   You don't have to bob and weave and wind and wander
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.300]   'cause he leads you forward.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:29.720]   Romans 8, 28 says, "And we know that for those who love God,
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   all things," that is a universal statement of totality.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.740]   All things work together for good
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.660]   for those who are called according to his purposes.
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.040]   What's all that mean?
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.960]   In a world that's saying, hey, you gotta have sex,
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.720]   you need to find a partner,
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.400]   and you need to make sure to look for marriage,
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.960]   to have a fulfilling and complete human experience,
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.920]   you, if you have Jesus, can say, no, I'm good.
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.980]   I've got everything I need.
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.780]   I'm not one who is needy like the rest of the world
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.300]   that subscribes to your advice
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.340]   because I have all that I need in him.
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.220]   I have one who stabilizes me.
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.220]   I have one who leads me forward.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.640]   I have one who works all things,
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.820]   even the bad of my life into good purpose.
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.580]   I have a God that I can depend on instead.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.500]   My happiness does not rise or fall
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.940]   on the back of whether or not I find love in this life.
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.480]   My happiness rises and falls on the fact
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.120]   that love has already found me in this life.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.660]   Jesus has found me, which is big when it comes to romance
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:40.440]   because few things are more anxiety-inducing than dating.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.700]   I remember in that ministry that I was a part of
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.800]   that I described at the very beginning of the night,
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.400]   I could literally spot the guys,
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.120]   point them out in a crowd
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.440]   that were showing up to our Bible studies,
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.480]   not because they just wanted to open the leather
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.160]   and read together, they wanted to find a spouse.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.000]   It was easy.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.780]   I could point them out.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.000]   Those guys that are, "Where's my hug at?" kind of guys.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.060]   You know, I could find those dudes.
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.100]   They always had shirts whose sleeves were slightly too tight
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.120]   for their arms and their cologne wafted across the room.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.680]   I could smell them before I ever saw them.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.640]   I knew they, for some reason, would spontaneously appear
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.780]   wherever it was the girls were gathering.
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.840]   You could point them out a mile away.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.480]   On the girl side of things,
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.560]   whenever a new girl would enter into the Bible study,
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.840]   you could see the death glare.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.120]   Like every girl was out looking upon that new arrival
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.240]   as my new best friend.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.120]   But you were the arch enemy that I have been waiting for.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.840]   You were the one who is here to threaten
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.680]   all of my eternal happiness
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.640]   and the men whom I have come to find.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.480]   That's what I would find.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.320]   It was so easy.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.440]   And the reason why all this is true
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.840]   is because dating is anxiety-inducing.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.520]   Like it leaves people so pent up and worried.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.840]   It spins them up and then it spirals them out
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.600]   with all sorts of emotion.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.840]   It felt crazy to me.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.360]   And yet the reality is, it is true,
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.360]   not just for me there, but for you in here.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.960]   The data would say that 68% of women,
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.880]   68% of women, that's like seven out of 10 of you,
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.560]   would say that dating is your leading cause of stress.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.920]   That's crazy.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.920]   Like, have you seen the job market?
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.680]   Have you looked at the cost of living?
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.240]   Just look at the timeline on whatever social media you have.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.680]   There is negative news everywhere.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.040]   And yet you're like, I've seen it all,
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.320]   but it has nothing to do in comparison to my dating life.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.280]   So much so that you're so stressed out
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.960]   that women even reported that some had passed out
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.720]   and puked on a date because of that stress.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.120]   Guys, you're not necessarily losing your lunch
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.520]   the thought of dating, but you are losing your nerve
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.440]   because 63%, not seven out of 10, but six out of 10 men
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.240]   are just opting to stay single
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.760]   given the difficulties they find in the dating world.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.600]   They're just like, I'm out, I'm out.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.880]   Y'all can play with that.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.920]   I'm gonna go over here and sit on the sideline.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.520]   That's often the man's approach.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.560]   What's that all mean?
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:10.760]   Seeking out love, searching for the one,
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.720]   sharing your feelings, risking rejection,
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.280]   and processing the possibility of forever
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.840]   with someone leaves people feeling anxious.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.560]   And yet here's the thing for the believer,
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.400]   as we set sail and we voyage into the sea
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.960]   of swirling emotion and capsizing doubt
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.240]   that we call dating,
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.440]   we have a steady anchor.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.320]   We have one who holds us fast
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.000]   because we don't depend upon our strength in the storm.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.800]   We depend on his.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.560]   We know one who calms the winds and the waves,
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.640]   even whenever the hurricane of romance blows through.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.560]   We know God, and that changes everything.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.200]   Paul says it like this when he writes
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.640]   to the church of Philippi.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.960]   He says in Philippians 4, six through seven, famous verse,
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.640]   "Do not be anxious about anything,
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.680]   "but in everything by prayer and supplication
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.280]   "with thanksgiving," those are deeds of dependence.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.120]   "Let your requests be made known to God
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.300]   "and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.240]   "will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.880]   You see, when you depend on God,
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.120]   you move from an obsession to that which isn't.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.440]   I don't have a boyfriend, I don't have a girlfriend,
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.280]   I'm gonna be alone forever.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.800]   All I'm gonna have around my house are cats.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.680]   You move from an obsession with what isn't
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.040]   to a gratitude for what is,
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.740]   that I may not have a significant other,
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:41.880]   but I do have the significant one.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.500]   I have God, and he is all I need.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.160]   I need nothing else, for in him,
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.040]   I find all that I want and require.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.460]   Now hear me, I'm not saying
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.860]   that you shouldn't desire a spouse,
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.660]   but what I am saying is that you don't need
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.780]   to be desperate for one.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.860]   You see, desperate people do desperate things.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.460]   I see this all the time.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.740]   If you live within a ministry context long enough,
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:15.160]   you will see good godly people do crazy desperate things.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.160]   The amount of godly women I know
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.920]   that have in a desperate attempt to find love,
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.760]   settled for some guy that goes to church,
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.920]   it is astronomical.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.280]   I can't begin to count how many women I know
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.640]   that have actually found themselves doing it.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.920]   I have talked to many of you down here
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.280]   at the foot of the stage,
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.900]   and here's what I wanna tell you,
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.160]   whether you're a guy in that situation,
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.440]   or you're a girl in that situation,
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.340]   if you are having to convince yourself they're Christian,
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.560]   they're not.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.100]   They're not a believer.
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.240]   We know believers not just by their words,
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.200]   but by their deeds.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.240]   We can look at their life,
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.480]   and we can see the one who is Lord over it.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.120]   But Kylan, once we get married, I'm gonna help him out.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.520]   No, you're not.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.300]   He doesn't want your help.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.640]   Like if he is not willing to love Jesus
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.600]   while he is trying to woo you,
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.220]   he will not love Jesus whenever he has won you.
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:08.880]   Right now he is in a season of impressing.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.200]   And so if you're not impressed with what you see,
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.880]   then why would you wait any longer?
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.480]   You have my permission to break up.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.360]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.420]   You want someone like what Jeremiah 17 describes.
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.200]   Jeremiah 17 says this, "Thus says the Lord,
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.640]   "'Cursed is the man who trusts in man
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.780]   "'and makes flesh his strength,
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.080]   "'whose heart turns away from the Lord.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.980]   "'He is like a scrub, I mean shrub, in the desert,
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.520]   "'and he shall not see any good come.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.720]   "'He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.480]   "'in an uninhabited salt land.'"
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.400]   Let me just stop there.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.120]   Does that sound like a guy you wanna pair up with?
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.280]   Like, did you hear the detail that Jeremiah just gave?
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.280]   He is like a shrub in the desert.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.600]   He shall not see any good.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.480]   He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness,
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.600]   in an uninhabited salt land.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.200]   I don't even know what some of that means,
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.640]   but I know that I don't want that to be my story.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.580]   But here's what you would want.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:10.000]   Verse seven, "Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.700]   "whose trust is in the Lord.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.860]   "He is like a tree planted by water
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.400]   "that sends out its roots by the stream,
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.600]   "and it does not fear when," not if,
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.440]   "but when the heat comes,
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.160]   "for its leaves remain green,
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.900]   "and it is not anxious in the year of drought,
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.800]   "for it does not cease to bear fruit."
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.200]   That's the kind of man you want, ladies.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.320]   That's the kind of woman you want, guys.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.400]   You want someone that trusts in Jesus,
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.000]   that depends on God,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.480]   that does not look to you to be their source of life
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.480]   because they have a source of life,
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.440]   that is able to look at you when, not if,
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.400]   but when the heat comes, when conflict arises,
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.080]   when you're at each other's throats,
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.560]   whenever one of you loses a job,
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.920]   whenever someone gets sick,
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.640]   whenever a child goes astray,
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.720]   whenever the circumstances of life begin to suffer,
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.240]   you want someone that looks at you and says,
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.760]   "I'm not going anywhere."
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.580]   Why?
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.220]   "Because I am committed to him,
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.140]   "and because I am committed to him,
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.060]   "I am committed to you.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.520]   "I'm not leaving.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.320]   "I'm dependent, not on you for my need,
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.440]   "but on him who satisfies my every need."
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.980]   That's the first thing you have to know,
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.680]   because without that, every other point,
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.760]   we'll walk through this week, next week,
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.040]   it is irrelevant.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.320]   You've gotta have that.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.640]   Second point, don't be passive.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.820]   Do be purposeful.
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:40.160]   Don't be passive, but you, you be purposeful.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.800]   If you look at the landscape of dating today,
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.160]   a greater percentage of young men
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.040]   are single in comparison to women
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.000]   than at any other point in history.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.960]   Why is that?
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.400]   The increasing prevalence of male passivity.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.240]   Now, before you ladies break out and cheer,
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.620]   and you start to amen everything that I say,
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.180]   let me be very fair.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.320]   I am not insinuating in any way
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.240]   that there is some deficiency within men today
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.680]   that there has not been in times past.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.560]   This is the primary male problem.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.800]   If you go back to the very beginning of the book,
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.400]   you know what Adam's original sin was?
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.480]   It was a sin of passivity.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.960]   This is something that men, we, not you,
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.080]   we are all imbued with by nature.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.720]   Our fallen nature says we are passive
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.120]   in our pursuit of anything,
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.160]   but particularly that which God has put us
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.240]   on this earth to do, to fulfill the cultural mandate.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.440]   And yet what we know is that while passivity
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.360]   isn't particular to our generation alone,
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.020]   it is nonetheless our problem.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.040]   We have to do something about it, men.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.920]   And so let me talk to you for a minute.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.640]   Sociologist and author Mark Regnerus,
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.800]   he describes in his book, "The Future of Christian Marriage,"
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.880]   that much of male passivity
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.280]   is the result of a culture accustomed to cheap sex.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.400]   What he means by cheap sex
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.680]   is he talks about what he calls marriage economics,
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:05.760]   is that things like cohabitation
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.720]   and casual hookups and pornography make alternatives,
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.920]   which God would say are good and right and desirable.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.920]   Things like abstinence and marriage, all the more costly.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.020]   And yet what does it mean if something costs more?
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:25.160]   It is more valuable.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.400]   It's worth more, as my friend in the front row said.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.920]   You see, what you need to know
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.700]   is that you don't stumble over diamonds,
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:41.300]   but you do pass over pennies all the time.
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:45.400]   You see, it is easy to passively move through life
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.600]   and see pennies scattered along the way.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.920]   And yet what do you do with them?
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.800]   Often you don't even bother to bend down and pick them up.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.960]   Why? Because they are worthless.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.040]   And yet how do you find a diamond?
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.640]   You purposefully pursue it.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.680]   You must mine for it.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.040]   It takes work.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.240]   It takes effort.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.680]   It takes initiation because it is valuable.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.760]   That's how we should pursue romantic relationships.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.280]   Men, very specifically,
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.400]   this is how you should pursue our ladies.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.240]   You pursue them the way that Jesus has pursued you.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.880]   First John 4:19 says, "We love because he first loved us."
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.700]   What is that saying?
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.280]   It's a very simple verse. We all know it.
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.280]   It's saying that Christ initiated with you
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.920]   before the thought ever even crossed your mind.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.160]   Ephesians 1:4 says, "Even as he chose us in him
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.020]   "before the foundation of the world,
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.060]   "we should be holy and blameless before him."
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.300]   It's saying that Jesus chose you.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.120]   Romans 5:8, "But God chose his love for us
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.080]   "in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.560]   "He was willing to not only seek you,
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.680]   "but sacrifice himself for you."
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.980]   This is the kind of purposeful love
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.600]   that we see in the person of Christ.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.340]   You see, in God, we find anything but passive.
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.060]   He loved us before the thought ever even crossed our mind.
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.540]   He chose us before we ever thought,
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.620]   "Maybe I should choose you."
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.980]   He gave himself.
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.580]   He died your death because he wanted you that bad.
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.880]   There is not a happenstance moment
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.540]   or a haphazard bone in God's body.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.900]   He is fully and finally intentional.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.200]   You date the same way.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.940]   You don't be passive, you be purposeful,
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.900]   which means for the men in the room,
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.300]   and don't worry, ladies, I'm coming to you next.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.660]   You initiate in the dating context.
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.060]   You don't just slide into their DMs
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.600]   or connect with them online in some convenient way.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.780]   And I'm not diminishing the opportunity
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.180]   that's available in online dating.
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:46.680]   That's another talk for another time.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.380]   There's good and there's bad to that as well.
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.420]   But what you need to know is that those things
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.700]   require no purposefulness.
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.780]   It takes no courage to slide into someone's DMs,
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.660]   to drop a meme, to like a comment.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.420]   It takes nothing of you to do that.
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.340]   And yet ladies, as you assess potential suitors,
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.260]   you need to see in them the kind of courage
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.000]   that you would wanna link up with.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.500]   Guys, you need to make every effort
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.440]   to do more than swipe right.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:16.060]   You need to walk across the room.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.500]   You need to tell a woman she's great.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.780]   And you need to ask her if she would be willing
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.220]   to go on a date with you.
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.540]   You be purposeful.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:29.580]   And the thing is, you don't need to take my word for it.
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.940]   93% of women report that they prefer the man
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:33.780]   to make the first move.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:38.300]   93%, that means nine times out of 10 in this room,
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.240]   if you catch yourself swapping glances with a young lady,
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.640]   more than likely she's waiting for you
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.160]   to do something about it.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.380]   That's what this is saying.
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:49.740]   She is expecting you to move with confidence,
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.500]   dignify her as worth the risk,
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.380]   and demonstrate a kind of courage
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.840]   that Christ was willing to take on himself
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.460]   to save his beloved.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.100]   But Kylan, what if I get rejected?
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:02.920]   You might.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.820]   But godly men don't run from the fight.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:06.980]   They don't run from the fight.
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.660]   We run into the fight.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.140]   We engage the fray.
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.000]   I remember the very first girl
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.660]   that I ever asked out in college.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:19.180]   I didn't know much, nor did I do much right at this point,
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:23.140]   but I remember by God's own clarion call,
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.880]   that she was worth me walking over and asking out.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:32.380]   And so, wide-eyed and feeble freshman Kylan,
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:37.100]   made the long stroll across the cafeteria,
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.260]   and the whole way he went, he said, "She's worth it.
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.500]   She's worth it.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.520]   She's worth it.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.360]   She's worth it.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.780]   She's crazy, but she's worth it."
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.460]   And as I stood there before her and all her friends
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.800]   not having chosen a good moment to do this,
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.680]   I asked her out and she said yes.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.700]   Later on, she asked me why.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.940]   And I told her, "Because I think you're worth it."
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:03.580]   Listen, if I can do that, we're not together, don't awe me.
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:09.100]   If I can do that, then you can do this.
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.620]   You can plan a date.
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.900]   You can send a text.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.500]   You can write an encouraging note.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.620]   You can send a voice message on your way home.
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.580]   You can make a reservation for dinner
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.480]   and you can tell her what to wear.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.580]   All right, ladies, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:28.820]   Ladies, ladies, like, yes, you are not off the hook
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:32.700]   because passivity is not just a guy problem.
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:38.440]   Listen, bye guys.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.740]   That guy, that guy.
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:46.740]   Listen, ladies, passivity is not just a guy problem.
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.640]   You do not wait for a man to start living your life.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.100]   So many women that I know,
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.460]   so many women I know that I've visited with,
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.260]   I've looked at them and I've asked them the question,
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.100]   "Hey, like, what's your plan, like next two, three years,
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.940]   like what's happening in your life?"
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.980]   And they have nothing figured out.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.820]   And the reason why is because I'm gonna meet my husband
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:09.780]   and we're gonna get married
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.540]   and then we're gonna move in together
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.220]   and we're gonna begin to start our brand new life.
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.060]   And as I do so, he'll take care of the finances
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:15.900]   and he'll take out the trash
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.740]   and I'll never have to break down a box in my life
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.140]   'cause he's gonna do all of that for me instead.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.580]   And yet what I want to look at them and say,
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.900]   as I have looked at them and said,
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.900]   and I want to say to you is fantasizing for your future
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.640]   is a form of passivity.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:36.220]   So many of you are placing your life on hold.
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.900]   You are pausing your progress personally
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.500]   because the fantasy of what you want tomorrow
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.980]   is more riveting than the reality
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.020]   of what you have right now.
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.060]   Do not do that to yourself.
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:51.460]   Don't, not just because you deserve more, we need more.
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.620]   Like we need you, we need you to pursue your career
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.900]   and not wait to purchase that home
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.180]   and start leading in your church and serving other people
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.180]   and moving towards your gifts in God
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.140]   because that will lead to his glory and our good.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.680]   We need you to do these things now, don't wait.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.020]   Don't pause your progress personally.
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.560]   Do not indulge your passivity.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.040]   Don't wait for a man to push forward in life.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.380]   A lot is said to young women
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.580]   about becoming a Proverbs 31 woman.
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:25.940]   But you need to hear this
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.140]   'cause it says this of that woman in verses 16 through 17.
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.400]   She considers a field and she buys it,
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.380]   meaning she's entrepreneurial.
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:39.780]   With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.620]   She's industrious and she dresses herself with strength
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:47.080]   and she makes her arms strong because she's secure.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.740]   She's secure, ladies.
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.140]   You be secure.
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.220]   You live purposefully with him
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.900]   and you live purposefully without him.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.620]   When I lived in College Station,
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.180]   I had a dear friend that worked in advertising up
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.180]   in New York City and she left New York City
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.740]   advertising agency to come all the way down
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:10.260]   to small town USA Aggieland because God had called her,
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:14.280]   God had called her to specifically minister to women.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:18.900]   And what we knew is it was a crazy decision for her to make
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.740]   because the rest of the world was looking,
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:20.560]   it was like, what are you doing?
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.780]   Like anybody that's, or everybody that's anybody
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.660]   lives in New York City.
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.980]   Like this is the place to meet someone
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:26.820]   if you're gonna meet someone.
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.580]   If you're gonna live it up, this is the place to live it up.
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.940]   Why would you leave here without a husband
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.780]   and move to that place of all places
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.560]   where the mean age is 18 to 22?
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.780]   Why would you do that to yourself?
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:38.380]   There are no romantic suitors in that city for you.
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:42.660]   And yet she said, I am driven by a purpose to my God,
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.860]   not to some man and so I will make the move.
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.900]   And she gave herself to the cause of Christ
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.700]   and she is making massive moves for the kingdom there.
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.180]   Ladies, you be like that.
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:57.660]   So say that all of this is making sense,
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.940]   but now you're wondering, how am I supposed to know
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.260]   or how are they supposed to know
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.980]   that I'm interested in them?
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:04.820]   Well, that's not a trick question,
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.840]   even though it can feel like, just go up and say hello.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.900]   It's not a trick question because we live in a culture
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.860]   that has made communicating our intent
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.860]   increasingly difficult.
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.840]   It doesn't take long to just read across our society
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.600]   and see things like benching and breadcrumbing
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.180]   and cuffing and curving and wild flowering and zombieing,
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:25.080]   none of which I made up here on the spot,
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.020]   all of which I read in the research
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.640]   and are prevalent in your culture
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.540]   because people don't know how to communicate.
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.480]   What the heck is happening right here?
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:38.340]   Which brings us to our third point.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:43.340]   Don't be confusing, but do be clear.
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:48.980]   Don't be confusing, but you be clear.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.420]   Oh gosh, I gotta go quick.
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.180]   First Corinthians 14, 33a says,
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.180]   "For God is not a God of confusion, but he is one of peace."
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.500]   Psalm 119, 130 said,
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.540]   "The unfolding of your words gives light.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:04.300]   It imparts understanding to the simple or the naive."
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.340]   If your dating is confusing, hear me on this.
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:07.500]   If your dating is confusing,
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.700]   then your dating is inconsistent with the character of God.
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.660]   God does not confuse his people.
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.500]   He gives clarity to his people.
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.460]   And we see that nowhere more exemplified
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.740]   than in the person of Jesus.
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.640]   If you read Mark 12, verse 14,
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.780]   you hear them describe this of our savior.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.020]   It says, "And they came and they said to him,
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.820]   'Teacher, we know that you are true.
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.140]   You don't care about anyone's opinion.
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.420]   You're not swayed by appearances,
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.340]   but you truly teach the way of God.'"
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:34.180]   I love that.
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.260]   Like Jesus didn't change how he spoke
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.500]   or what he spoke to people,
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.940]   depending upon who it was that was standing in front of him.
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:43.540]   He did not change his opinion or truth based upon,
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.020]   or he did not change the truth
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.380]   on the basis of what people he was engaging with.
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:49.620]   Instead, he was always truthful.
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:50.460]   He was always honest.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.700]   He was always understandable to those that he engaged with.
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.760]   And our dating should be the same.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.420]   That's what people want.
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.700]   According to one of the largest surveys
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.500]   conducted on singles and dating in America
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.340]   from people just like you,
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:05.440]   the highest value in a potential partner
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.400]   is someone who is upfront about their relationship goals.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.520]   Meaning we don't want to play games with each other.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:16.220]   We want to speak plain to each other.
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.720]   We want to say what we mean,
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.900]   and we want to mean what we say.
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.900]   I remember when Brooke and I were dating
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.740]   early on in our relationship.
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.460]   We went on a date, amazing date,
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.700]   planned the entire thing out,
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.100]   had an incredible evening together,
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.540]   stimulating conversation.
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.300]   And I drove to drop her off at the Southern Dormitories
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.180]   at Texas A&M University.
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.080]   Do not whoop for the sake of our other friends in the room.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.180]   Though I love you.
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:43.480]   And I leaned in, unplanned, and I kissed her goodnight.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.540]   It did not take long, less than 24 hours,
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.740]   for her to call me and say,
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.660]   "We need to process some things."
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.740]   So we sat in my truck the next day,
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.100]   and she looked at me and she said,
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.020]   "I don't know what kind of girl you think I am,
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.760]   "but that's not the kind of girl that I actually am.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.240]   "I am not okay with that line of engagement.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.020]   "That's confusing to me.
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.100]   "What do you actually want this to be?"
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.380]   And it was there in the truck
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.020]   that I defined our relationship,
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.740]   because she called me to the carpet,
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.060]   and I loved her for it.
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.460]   Ladies, this isn't even in my notes,
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.180]   but I just need you to know for me,
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:20.980]   so much of the maturity of our men hinges upon
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.660]   your ability to look at them and say,
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.220]   "I'm not putting up with this."
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:27.580]   They will do as I did.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.820]   They will lay restless at night in their bed,
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.740]   and they will wonder, "What has happened to me?"
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:38.000]   And you actually have the key
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.340]   to unlocking their growth in God.
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:44.460]   We must be clear with one another,
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.860]   which means we don't flirt with someone
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.580]   just to get a sense of validation.
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.580]   I talk to guys, and I've literally heard guys
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.060]   look at me and say, "But I love the thrill
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.060]   "of the hunt, Kylan."
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.100]   Do you know how weird that sounds?
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:59.660]   Like, take the camouflage off, bro.
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.940]   Like, she's not a trophy for you to hunt and kill.
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.820]   She is a treasure for you to find and keep.
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.260]   Like, you're not gonna mount her on your wall.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.780]   You're gonna move in together,
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.260]   and you're going to serve one another.
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.500]   That's the nature of how this goes.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.860]   Ladies, stop hiding behind the excuse
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.500]   that you're just bubbly, and you can't help the fact
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.940]   that he's catching the wrong idea.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.780]   Avoid emotionally charged friendships.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.460]   Like, don't have full conversations through text
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.780]   or spend multiple hours a week with that girl or that guy
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.940]   who you have absolutely no legitimate interest in.
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.540]   Even if you love spending time with them,
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.420]   here's the thing.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.960]   If you love spending time with them, then date them.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.260]   But the reality is, many of you don't love
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:37.100]   spending time with them.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.240]   You love that they're spending time with you.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:43.020]   And that's very validating, and yet it's very confusing.
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.900]   Stop ghosting them.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.780]   Do I actually need to unpack this one?
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.980]   Here's what I would say.
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:53.060]   If you're not interested, affirm them where you can
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.940]   and graciously tell them you just don't see it
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:56.840]   working out for yourself.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.300]   I will literally tell you what to say.
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.140]   Are you listening?
[00:35:59.140 --> 00:35:59.960]   Here's what you can say.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.420]   If you're not interested in someone, you can say,
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.160]   "Hey, I think you're great,
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.780]   "but I don't think we're a great fit.
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.860]   "Thank you for the honor of asking me out."
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.740]   That's it.
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.180]   It's that simple.
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:17.100]   It's dignifying to the other person, not demeaning to them.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.840]   You actually treat them like they exist,
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.520]   that they're a child of God,
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.900]   that they're your brother or sister in Christ.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.500]   You don't ghost them.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:31.220]   Avoid using some derivative of, "It's not you, it's me."
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.780]   No, it is them.
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:34.940]   So tell them that.
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.060]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.220]   Saying things like, "I'll always love you.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.060]   "You're so great.
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.940]   "Maybe one day the timing's just bad."
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.340]   That is not helping them.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.160]   Listen to me.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.600]   Clarity brings closure,
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.460]   and it's kindness to help people close the chapter
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:51.740]   on one stage of life
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:54.220]   so they might begin to write a new chapter with someone else.
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:55.840]   You do that for them.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.820]   I'm not saying you cut them down to the knees.
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.160]   "Well, I hate you because you smell bad,
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.000]   "and your hair's weird,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.980]   "and you have a weird taste in food or music."
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.560]   Don't do that.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.820]   Be clear with them.
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:06.640]   Gracious, but truthful.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.620]   And then definitely, last but not least,
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:10.540]   quit using God as your excuse.
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:14.500]   (congregation cheering)
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.900]   It is insincere
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.680]   to say
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:26.920]   that God is calling you someplace else,
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.240]   that you just don't have peace about this,
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.560]   that you're still processing with your community
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.940]   when in reality, you just don't like them.
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.820]   Listen to me.
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.140]   I'm not trying to be funny.
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:39.560]   I'm really wanting to engage with you
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.160]   because this sounds nice,
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.440]   but what it does is it excuses you from the responsibility,
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.460]   and it accuses God of being at fault.
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:49.740]   Do not do that.
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.280]   Do not call his character into question
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.120]   in the life of another believer
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.880]   because you're not interested.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:00.240]   That is a disproportionate allocation of value.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.480]   It's okay to say, "I don't see this working,"
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.640]   but don't tell them God doesn't see it working.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.880]   Proverbs 24, 26 says,
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.460]   "An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.000]   "Clarity is kindness, so be clear with one another."
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.480]   And lastly for tonight, don't be dramatic.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:22.600]   Do be steady.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.960]   You be steady.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.140]   Second Corinthians 10, five says,
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.200]   "We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.720]   "raised against the knowledge of God,
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.440]   "and we take every thought captive to obey Christ."
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.540]   Isaiah 26, three says,
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:34.920]   "You keep him in perfect peace,
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:38.480]   "whose mind is stayed on you because he trusts in you."
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.320]   Philippians 4, eight says,
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.900]   "Finally, brothers and sisters,
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.660]   "whatever is true and honorable and just
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.420]   "and pure and lovely and commendable,
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:45.560]   "if there's any excellence,
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.020]   "if there's anything worthy of praise,
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.400]   "then think about these things."
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:53.120]   You hear what these verses are emphasizing?
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.360]   They are all emphasizing your thought life,
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.640]   that we should take thoughts captive to obey Christ,
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.120]   that we should keep our minds stayed on God,
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.400]   that we should think about godly things.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.360]   Why does that matter?
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.120]   Because you want to date someone that's in their right mind.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.320]   I remember a mentor of mine,
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.480]   he called me and he asked me,
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.800]   "Hey, how are you and Brooke doing?"
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.320]   And I responded, "Man, we're doing really great.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.660]   "Like nothing really new to report."
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.660]   And I loved his response.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:17.560]   He sighed on the other end of the phone and he said,
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.260]   "Man, isn't that awesome?"
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:26.020]   Steadiness is not listed amongst the most sexy qualities
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.420]   to find in a suitor,
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.260]   but it is listed among the best qualities
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.900]   to find in a suitor.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.540]   You want someone that is like their God,
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.180]   the same today, yesterday, and forever.
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.320]   You want them to be consistent.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.500]   You don't want to date crazy.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.460]   You don't want someone that's lost in their feelings.
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:45.380]   You want someone that's tethered to the truth,
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:49.300]   that tunes their life to the voice of God.
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.740]   But Kylan, what about following your heart?
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.300]   That is terrible advice.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.140]   Do not follow your heart.
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.900]   Follow God's word.
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.940]   Like the scriptures tell us in Proverbs 28, 26,
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.420]   as one example,
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.520]   he who trusts in his own heart is a fool,
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.680]   but he who walks wisely will be delivered.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.300]   How do you walk wisely
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.340]   with the one that has written wisdom
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.620]   into the fabric of creation?
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.980]   You see, the heart wants for things that it should not,
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.000]   and it leads us to do things we regret.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.360]   So we don't follow our feelings.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.600]   We focus on the truth.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.440]   That's who we are.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.720]   We are a people of the truth.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.580]   We follow it and it alone.
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.020]   You see, what you have to know
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.340]   is whatever is consistently true
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.540]   in your significant other's life
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:31.300]   is going to eventually become consistently true
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.900]   in your own life.
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.100]   Because as you date and you come together,
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.580]   one another, standing in the altar,
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.420]   because that's the point and purpose of dating,
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.260]   it's to eventually have a series of yeses
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.740]   that leads to an eventual I do,
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:46.060]   what you will find is that what's true of them
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.380]   will become true of you.
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:50.020]   You will become like one another,
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.460]   or you'll just see that this isn't working,
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.660]   and you'll go against God's will and you'll divorce.
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.220]   This is how these things happen.
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.740]   You want someone that is not drama.
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:58.580]   Well, he's always angry.
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:40:59.920]   He can't seem to regulate his emotions.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.580]   Well, she always knows what's going on with her friends
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.560]   or with her friends or our neighbors' lives.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.500]   Do you think you want someone to know the details
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.340]   of everybody's life as well as the details of yours?
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.180]   It sounds like they're not good
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.860]   at probably keeping that information locked.
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:12.780]   Well, she likes bad boys.
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.740]   That sounds like sabotage to your peace.
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.020]   You know, I would avoid that at all costs.
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:20.300]   Like you don't want someone that's full of drama.
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.540]   You want someone that's steady.
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:28.760]   In the book of Judges, we meet a guy by the name of Samson.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.820]   Samson is head over heels in love
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.140]   with this woman named Delilah.
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.700]   She was a Philistine woman.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.200]   And what you see is there are two things
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.980]   characterized in her relationship with Samson.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.100]   She is characterized by a desire for him,
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.860]   but also a deceit of him.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.660]   You see, she wanted to betray Samson
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:49.820]   into the hands of her people so they might overcome him.
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.260]   And so the entirety of their relationship,
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.460]   she is trying to figure out what his weakness is.
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:57.420]   You want to know what Samson's weakness was?
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:59.780]   It wasn't his hair.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.700]   It's that he fell in love with crazy.
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.580]   That's Samson's problem.
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.420]   He started dating drama.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.700]   Do not make the same mistake.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.820]   You date to find a spouse.
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.220]   You went to find someone that you can link up with
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.140]   and you can move forward through life together alongside.
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:21.500]   Will you know if they're the one on the first date?
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.780]   No.
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.580]   Will you know if they're the one in the first month?
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.500]   Likely no.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.140]   So many of us have bought into this formulaic
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.220]   Christian science where we must tell her
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:35.060]   that I am only pursuing her for the sake of being united
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:37.300]   to one another in holy matrimony under God
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.540]   and before all of our friends.
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.320]   And then I must make all of my intentions
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.580]   plainly clear before.
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.260]   We're so bought into this science.
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.460]   Listen, dating is not a science, it is an art.
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.860]   But there are a series of colors you should paint with.
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.440]   We have given you four tonight.
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.880]   We're gonna give you four more next week.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.040]   You paint with them a beautiful picture
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:57.340]   that matches the picture of Christ's love for us.
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:58.700]   How has Christ loved us?
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:01.020]   He's done all of this.
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:04.220]   When we were anxious in spirit,
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.780]   he was dependent on our behalf.
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:09.260]   He submitted himself to the will of God.
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:13.140]   He left heaven, he came to earth because God wanted him to.
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:16.260]   What we see in Christ is that when we were passive,
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.540]   he was still purposeful.
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.500]   He pursued a people, catch this,
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.820]   that wanted nothing to do with him.
[00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.380]   He didn't fear rejection.
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:25.380]   He looked at us and he said,
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.900]   "You can tell me no and no and no."
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.540]   Again, some of you have been telling him no and no
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.140]   and no all your life.
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.220]   And yet he is here tonight pursuing you.
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:37.620]   And he's saying, "Please finally say yes to me.
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.660]   "I am purposeful for you.
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:42.900]   "I will pursue you because you're valuable to me.
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:44.700]   "You're not some penny that I'm gonna leave
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.140]   "laying upon the ground.
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.040]   "No, I want to scoop you up.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.820]   "I want to mine you out.
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:52.300]   "I want to bring you to myself."
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.540]   You see, when we were confused,
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.660]   what we see is that Jesus was clear.
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:59.240]   Like he brought clarity to the confusion of our condition.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.900]   We, like she had gone astray.
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.660]   We didn't know what we were doing.
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.540]   We were lost in our rebellion
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:08.380]   and yet Christ full of crystal clarity saw
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:09.860]   that is their condition.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:11.220]   This is the cost.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:14.640]   And what I will do is I will give myself to pay it.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.300]   And what we know is that Jesus,
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:23.300]   he, while we were lost in the drama of our death,
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.020]   he was steady for our sake.
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:29.800]   Jesus was one who never wavered for you,
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.120]   never second guessed about you.
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:36.720]   He always kept the right mind that he wanted you
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:40.320]   even to the point when he should have questioned it himself,
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.120]   hanging upon the cross and dying your death for you.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.080]   This is the kind of love that Christ has for you.
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.160]   Listen to me.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.300]   If you wanna build a relationship that lasts,
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.200]   then look to the one that has built a relationship
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.040]   that does last.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.100]   He has built a relationship with you
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:00.280]   that will not just last today or tomorrow or this life.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.480]   It lasts forever.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.920]   So many of us are trying to do this on our own.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.800]   We're looking to the world for advice.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.840]   No, stop looking elsewhere.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.360]   Look right here.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.940]   He wants to tell you how to do it
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:15.280]   because he has shown you how to do it.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.880]   He has shown you by way of his own sacrifice.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:23.320]   Let me pray that you would believe it.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.360]   God, we are so grateful for tonight.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:32.920]   God, I am personally overwhelmed
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:37.020]   at the thought of how much you love us,
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:41.340]   what you would give to have us.
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:46.080]   I pray, Lord, please,
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.180]   as has been my prayer,
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:54.400]   let us not just see hints and hacks
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:58.680]   for how to date well and find love and get married.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:01.480]   God, no, help us to see the beauty beneath it all.
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:05.300]   That beauty which would say,
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:10.040]   I'll give up everything to have you.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.560]   I love you so much.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.200]   How much, Jesus?
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.760]   I love you so much that I'll give my life for you.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.240]   But I don't deserve that.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.340]   You don't deserve it.
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.500]   I'm not worth that.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.660]   You're not worthy of it.
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.860]   But I love you anyways.
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:28.260]   I choose you anyways.
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.100]   That's how great the love of God is for us.
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:34.300]   And so, God, it's to that love that we respond tonight.
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:35.140]   We're grateful.
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:38.140]   Let us, God, now hold nothing back
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.440]   for nothing held you back in pursuit of us.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.620]   It's in your name we pray, amen.
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:53.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
