1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:22,180
 - Oh yeah, how we doing?

3
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,020
 Dallas?

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,320
 Anybody here from Fort Worth?

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,640
 Anybody here from Fort Worth?

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,740
 Come on.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,160
 You know there's about 500, 400, 500

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,940
 folks gathered in Fort Worth right now too,

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,780
 so that's fun.

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,840
 Greetings Fort Worth, we're glad you're tuning in.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,240
 Love what God is doing over there.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,920
 Grateful for Garrett and his leadership

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,680
 and y'all's volunteers out there.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,200
 It's fun to be back with you guys.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,840
 Everybody watch the Super Bowl?

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,260
 That's fun.

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,920
 All right, it's got a mixed emotions.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,220
 I even heard some no's, which I'm sorry for you.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,680
 My family's been sick, okay?

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,000
 If somebody's sick in our family,

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,520
 that means the whole family goes down eventually.

22
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,680
 They like, the kids are in school,

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,880
 you know, the little ones in childcare sometimes,

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,880
 they just kind of pass infectious diseases

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,760
 out like playing cards, okay?

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,000
 Like baseball cards, they just trade that back and forth.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,440
 Probably not infectious diseases,

28
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,600
 but I don't, the right word escapes me right now.

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,200
 So sickness, illnesses.

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,160
 And so, family goes down with a stomach bug,

31
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,440
 comes back, bounces back.

32
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,960
 Weston's down, they've all got this kind of flu-like cold,

33
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,680
 kind of severe cough.

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,880
 I haven't gone down yet, praise God.

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,240
 And so like, I've been talking to my wife,

36
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,720
 I'm like, I tell her the other night,

37
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,560
 I'm like, hey, I don't wanna be selfish,

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,640
 but can you not breathe on me?

39
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,880
 Like, can you sleep the other way?

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,280
 And roll, you know, turn the other way,

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,720
 because man, I just, I don't wanna,

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,920
 I'm trying not to get sick.

43
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,500
 And so Super Bowl came, and so Finley and I

44
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,740
 were the only healthy ones,

45
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,160
 'cause she kind of had bounced back

46
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,320
 and the other three were down.

47
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,440
 And we had a kind of a Super Bowl/birthday party to go to,

48
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,640
 and so I just said, hey, I'll take Finley,

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,320
 she and I will go and we'll have a great time.

50
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,400
 And so Monica just said, hey, that's cool,

51
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
 can you be back by seven?

52
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,280
 And I'm like, yeah, yeah, I'll be,

53
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,800
 'cause school's the next day, you know,

54
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,040
 bedtimes are a big deal right now

55
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
 and this season we're in, and so I'm like,

56
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,240
 yeah, I'll be back by seven.

57
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,640
 Well, I don't know if you watch the Super Bowl,

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,760
 you remember that right around seven o'clock,

59
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,400
 that was that epic kind of 80-yard and 29-seconds run

60
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,360
 for the Seahawks to tie the game going into halftime.

61
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,160
 And so like that's seven o'clock, I'm like,

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,320
 okay, I can't leave right now, you know, of course.

63
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,480
 And then halftime rolls around,

64
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,040
 and I didn't know who was performing at the halftime,

65
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,800
 so I was like, I can't leave right now.

66
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,840
 And you know, then there was like 10 minutes

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,080
 of commentators, which would have been a great time to leave,

68
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,960
 but I didn't know that's what was gonna happen.

69
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,640
 And so then the halftime starts,

70
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,720
 and I'm like, okay, I can't leave right now.

71
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,320
 She texts me, she's like, hey, you're on your way, right?

72
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,040
 I'm like, right, Finley, let's go.

73
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,560
 And so we get in the car, we go home, and I walk in,

74
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,960
 and she's so, my wife is amazing, she's so gracious.

75
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,040
 And she just says, she asked me when Finley and I walk in,

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,400
 she goes, hey, you know, man,

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,520
 what happened to that seven o'clock thing?

78
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,680
 I thought you were gonna be home by seven.

79
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,240
 We know we gotta get Finley bathed and to bed.

80
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,720
 And so I, you know, I'm like, well, listen,

81
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,840
 I've got a great reason, okay, here's the deal.

82
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,240
 It was Katy Perry, it was a big lion.

83
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,120
 I mean, there's guys moving the legs.

84
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,480
 I didn't know if it was gonna turn around,

85
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,760
 and like, you know, I didn't know what was gonna happen.

86
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,760
 And then, you know, I'm there,

87
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,920
 and then there were some sharks and palm trees

88
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,120
 and men dressed up, and I mean, like,

89
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,800
 who can leave at a time like that?

90
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,600
 And then I get home and I find out I missed Missy Elliott,

91
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,840
 you know, and I'm like, it's your fifidififuenet,

92
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,480
 you know, and she's like, what?

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,560
 She's like, what did you say?

94
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,680
 I'm like, your fifidifufuenet, Missy Elliott, you know?

95
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,520
 And because of the seven, I mean,

96
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,040
 I didn't even get to see it.

97
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,080
 And I'd love a flip it and reverse it on that.

98
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,400
 I'd love to do that over,

99
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,440
 because, because here's why,

100
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,600
 because the little ones were there,

101
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,520
 and they were watching,

102
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,680
 and they learned a really important lesson.

103
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,240
 They learned that, you know, as long as

104
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,880
 you don't wanna miss out on something,

105
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,760
 you can flake out on your commitment.

106
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,120
 It doesn't really matter what you said,

107
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,520
 as long as you have a reason,

108
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,960
 as long as you can explain it away,

109
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,880
 it's okay that you didn't do what you said

110
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,160
 that you were going to do.

111
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,720
 And that's what happens for us, I think.

112
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,880
 It's an epidemic, really.

113
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,040
 They're saying in our generation among millennials,

114
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,680
 and Gen Y, if that's you, if you're here,

115
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,560
 and they're saying we're the flakiest demographic

116
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,480
 generation ever to walk the planet,

117
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,720
 the most non-committal.

118
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,040
 And the scripture says a whole lot about this,

119
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,840
 and so first, let me just kind of make a case

120
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,680
 from statistics about why we are afraid

121
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,920
 of missing out on something,

122
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,800
 and therefore we don't commit.

123
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,560
 We don't commit in relationships.

124
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,600
 The US adult marriage rate is at an all-time low

125
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,760
 in our generation, 51%.

126
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,680
 That's compared with 72% in 1960.

127
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,880
 Today, just 20% of adults ages 18 to 29,

128
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,120
 that's a lot of us, are married.

129
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,960
 Only 20% compared to 59% in 1960.

130
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,600
 I love this one.

131
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,960
 This is in Time Magazine, just July 2014.

132
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,680
 43% of millennials said they would vote for marriage

133
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,080
 to be performed on a temporary two-year trial period.

134
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,560
 43%, almost half of our peers said,

135
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,880
 "Hey, we don't want marriage to be permanent.

136
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,080
 "Can we just kind of have a try before you buy season?"

137
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,520
 And everybody gasped, and everybody said,

138
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,120
 "What, that's crazy."

139
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,000
 But you know what, we date like that.

140
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,200
 Don't we date like that?

141
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,440
 We come up with new categories of dating,

142
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,080
 and then seriously dating, cohabitating.

143
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,240
 And it's like, well, no, we don't wanna redefine

144
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,000
 God's institution of marriage.

145
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,880
 We don't want a two-year trial period,

146
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,040
 but we'll try before the altar.

147
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,400
 I mean, we'll pretend.

148
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,880
 And careers, millennials stay only two years at a job

149
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,720
 compared to baby boomers who average seven years

150
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,000
 and Gen Xers who average five years.

151
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,600
 And then church, something relevant to us here.

152
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,800
 Three out of five millennial Christians, that's 59%,

153
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,640
 disconnect either permanently or for an extended period

154
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,800
 of time from church after the age of 15.

155
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,840
 Over half leave the church.

156
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,480
 And each year, one out of seven adults changes

157
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,840
 his or her church membership, while one out of six

158
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,400
 rotates between different churches.

159
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,200
 So then I'll take a little Piper, little Chandler,

160
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,240
 little Wagner, just, hey, who's hot right now?

161
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,560
 Who has the best worship leader?

162
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,720
 I'm gonna go here this Sunday, there the next Sunday.

163
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,160
 Where can I consume from?

164
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,440
 And here's why this matters,

165
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,160
 and why this message is so important,

166
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,280
 because the greatest things in life require a commitment.

167
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,040
 You think about all the things you want right now.

168
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,040
 Love, careers, a relationship with Jesus.

169
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,920
 All of this requires a commitment.

170
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,200
 Let's just say somebody comes up to you and you're like,

171
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,160
 hey man, do you have a faith?

172
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,160
 And they're like, yeah, I'm a Christian.

173
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,920
 Yeah, I'm a Christian, because that's in Dallas,

174
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,940
 that's common, yeah, I'm a Christian.

175
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,200
 Because we have to check a box,

176
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,000
 so that one, I'm mostly a Christian.

177
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,720
 Check that box, and then you ask 'em,

178
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,000
 and you say, okay, well, check this out, listen,

179
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 do you read the Bible?

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,080
 Yeah, I mean, I did, I read it last month,

181
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,160
 I've read some of it before, I've heard of the Bible.

182
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,400
 I can spell Bible.

183
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,160
 Do you, are you a member of a church?

184
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,840
 No, but I mean, I go, Christmas and Easter,

185
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,400
 and I go to the porch sometimes on Tuesdays,

186
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,640
 and I mean, I go to church sometimes.

187
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,600
 I mean, I've been to fellowship, I've been to the village.

188
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,200
 Man, I've seen Watermark, IBC, First Baptist,

189
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,720
 I've been to those places.

190
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,000
 Oh, okay, prayer life, I pray sometimes.

191
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,760
 Wait, hold on, wait, I'm confused.

192
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,460
 Why do you say you're a Christian?

193
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,360
 What makes you think you're a Christian?

194
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,080
 Well, I mean, my parents were Christians.

195
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,580
 Okay, that's cool.

196
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,800
 My parents were teachers.

197
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,840
 Okay, you know?

198
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,040
 Well, I mean, well, in the sixth grade,

199
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,100
 I prayed this prayer at camp.

200
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,760
 Oh, you mean you made a commitment to Christ?

201
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,760
 Yeah, you made a commitment to follow Christ?

202
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,560
 Yeah, did you follow Christ?

203
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,000
 You still following Christ?

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,320
 Can we talk about that?

205
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,100
 Tonight, we're talking, as we move through this series,

206
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,300
 Missing Out, we're talking about commitment.

207
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,880
 And the things that we need to commit to

208
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,360
 as followers of Jesus, and I'm afraid

209
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,860
 that we don't commit to 'cause we're afraid

210
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,800
 of what we're gonna miss out on,

211
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,360
 and the reality of it is,

212
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,880
 it is because we're not committing, we're missing out on.

213
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,160
 Like, because we haven't committed to particular things

214
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,040
 that God has called us to, you are,

215
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,320
 and I'm promising you, I'm telling you,

216
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,120
 I'm pleading with you to listen with open ears.

217
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,940
 Like, check your ego at the door.

218
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,660
 You came in, you don't trust authority,

219
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,800
 or you're thinking, man, how do you know better than me?

220
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,920
 I'm just gonna read from the Scriptures,

221
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,000
 and I'm telling you, you are missing out

222
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,540
 on God's best for you.

223
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,300
 Because you're missing out on some key commitments.

224
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,900
 And I've taught on commitment once before in Generation Y,

225
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,740
 and if you didn't hear that, I'd encourage you to listen.

226
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,500
 Every volunteer that serves at the porch

227
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,460
 has to listen to that message before they serve with us,

228
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,420
 and there, I talk about keeping commitments.

229
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,680
 Tonight, I'm going to talk more about making commitments

230
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,140
 as we move through this series, Missing Out.

231
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,540
 And so, I'ma think,

232
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,980
 you know, where to start tonight,

233
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,860
 or where we'll go is why we don't commit,

234
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,620
 how we can commit, and why it matters.

235
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,980
 And I'm gonna go back to the basics,

236
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,340
 basically, where we started last week is in Genesis.

237
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,300
 So I'll be in Genesis 2 and 3,

238
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,660
 and I just wanna show you what happened in the beginning.

239
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,300
 It's going to be a little philosophical,

240
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,640
 so follow closely with me.

241
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,660
 I'll try to spell this out as simply as I can,

242
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,500
 but there's something really key that happened

243
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,100
 right at the beginning of the Bible.

244
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,980
 That has redefined our understanding of commitment.

245
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,160
 And so, in the beginning, we know there's God, the creator.

246
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
 There's a God, that's the reality.

247
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,540
 We're not him, he's there, he exists.

248
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,700
 He's alive and active and involved in our lives,

249
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,820
 and he created, he created by speaking

250
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,180
 the world into existence.

251
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,760
 He said it, it was, and it was good.

252
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,180
 The scripture says over and over,

253
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,380
 "He made light and land and sky and sea

254
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,620
 "and then animals and then man and woman."

255
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,420
 And he placed man and woman, Adam and Eve,

256
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,860
 in the garden, perfection.

257
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,540
 They had a relationship with him.

258
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,740
 They talked to him.

259
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,180
 They fellowshiped with God, the creator

260
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,500
 of the heavens and the earth.

261
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,880
 They had a relationship with him

262
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,580
 that you and I don't know today.

263
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,640
 It was a perfect one.

264
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,560
 They communed together, and there they were,

265
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,160
 and God says this, in perfection,

266
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,540
 and the Lord commanded the man,

267
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,600
 "You are free," this is verse 16, Genesis 2,

268
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,760
 "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden,

269
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,820
 "but you must not eat from the tree

270
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,860
 "of the knowledge of good and evil,

271
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,060
 "for when you eat from it, you will certainly die."

272
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,260
 Now, in the do not do this, this is where FOMO happens.

273
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,100
 Okay, fear of missing out happens in the do not,

274
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,660
 because any time we can't do something,

275
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,660
 we're like, well, why, why can't we?

276
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,740
 What, what's the Lord withholding from me?

277
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,940
 And this is Satan's playground, the do not,

278
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,620
 because we think God's holding something from,

279
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,180
 well, do not have sex before marriage.

280
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,500
 Like, really, like, what?

281
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,060
 I don't understand, well, I'm married in God's eyes.

282
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,900
 Well, what if?

283
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,700
 And I don't understand, what if we're going to get married?

284
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,340
 Well, is it really that big of a deal?

285
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,940
 In the do not, this is where the enemy plays,

286
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,820
 and we see that in Genesis 3, verse five.

287
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,560
 This is Satan talking to Eve.

288
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,540
 "For God knows that when you eat from it,

289
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,500
 "your eyes will be opened,

290
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,380
 "and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."

291
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,740
 Here's what he did, FOMO, he used FOMO to cause the fall.

292
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,320
 He said, hey, Eve, listen, you're missing out on something.

293
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,880
 In that tree, that one that God said don't eat from,

294
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,620
 there's something good there that God's withholding from you.

295
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,920
 And in fact, if you eat it, you'll be like him.

296
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,780
 You'll know the difference between good and evil.

297
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,420
 You know what's really interesting about that?

298
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,700
 I wanna show you something

299
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,660
 that maybe you've never noticed before.

300
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,420
 Satan wasn't lying.

301
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,160
 What he said was actually true.

302
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,560
 He said if you eat from it,

303
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,720
 you're gonna know the difference between good and evil.

304
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,000
 You're going to be like God.

305
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,380
 You know what happened when they ate from it?

306
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,000
 They were like God in the sense that they knew

307
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,320
 the difference between good and evil,

308
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,600
 or they knew of an evil that they didn't know of

309
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,360
 before they ate it.

310
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
 They didn't see it.

311
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,840
 I'm gonna show you this from the Scriptures.

312
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,160
 And so my first point this evening

313
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,480
 is why we fear commitments.

314
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,280
 I'm gonna give you three reasons why we fear commitment.

315
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,680
 Number one, we're afraid of what we will miss out on

316
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,540
 by committing.

317
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,800
 The first reason we are afraid of commitment

318
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,360
 is 'cause we're afraid of what we'll miss out on

319
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,600
 if we commit.

320
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,080
 And FOMO actually started,

321
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,340
 they tracked it back down to Harvard Business School.

322
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,800
 It started as FOBO, fear of better option.

323
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,200
 I'm afraid that something better is going to come along,

324
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,280
 and therefore I wanna keep my options open and not commit.

325
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,420
 This is very relevant to us in the life stage

326
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,640
 that many of us are in this evening.

327
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,620
 And I want you to know that the most evil act

328
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,080
 in the history of the entire world was caused by FOMO.

329
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,160
 And the consequences of this act, the fall,

330
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,800
 Eve and Adam doing the thing that God told them not to do

331
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,240
 was an awareness of evil existing.

332
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,280
 And so now commitment has been redefined,

333
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,120
 and I'm gonna explain this.

334
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,200
 But verse six says this.

335
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,800
 When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree

336
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,760
 was good for food and pleasing to the eye

337
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,840
 and also desirable for gaining wisdom,

338
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,480
 she began to feel like she was missing out on something.

339
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,880
 And so she took some of it and ate it.

340
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,400
 And she also gave some to her husband who was with her,

341
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,460
 and he ate it.

342
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,420
 Then the eyes, now this is what happened,

343
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,060
 the eyes of both of them were opened,

344
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,640
 just like Satan said they would be,

345
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,840
 and they realized they were naked.

346
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,360
 They say I say that funny.

347
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,400
 Naked.

348
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,620
 Is that better, naked?

349
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,960
 Naked, all right, I'm working.

350
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,240
 So they sewed fig leaves together

351
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,200
 and made coverings for themselves.

352
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,040
 So death enters the world because of FOMO,

353
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,560
 but the immediate consequences

354
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,840
 were really a greater understanding

355
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,940
 of the reality they lived in.

356
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,780
 Here's what I mean.

357
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,960
 They were already naked.

358
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,400
 They were already naked, right?

359
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,720
 One minute they're naked,

360
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,080
 and the next minute they realize they're naked.

361
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,120
 And shame is surrounding the situation

362
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,580
 that they were already in.

363
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,620
 And here's why that's important.

364
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,620
 Because sin entered the world through this man,

365
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,120
 now commitment, the thing we're talking about tonight,

366
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,040
 as we understand it, is not the commitment

367
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,800
 as God has wanted it to be.

368
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,720
 It's not the commitment that he defined for us.

369
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,360
 And so we now see commitment through the broken lens of sin.

370
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,260
 Let me explain.

371
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,480
 God made marriage to be permanent,

372
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,760
 but no one here knows that marriage.

373
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,120
 Marriage, the only marriage you know

374
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,160
 is the one that can end.

375
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,240
 You don't know of a permanent marriage.

376
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
 And you might say, "No, no, no, I know somebody

377
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,200
 "that's been married."

378
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,840
 No, no, I'm not saying you haven't seen an example

379
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,120
 of a permanent marriage.

380
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,280
 I'm saying that God made marriage,

381
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,200
 like as he defined it, it could not be broken.

382
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,640
 And we took something that could not be broken,

383
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,120
 and we broke it, and now we can't unlearn

384
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,540
 that it can be broken.

385
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,560
 Okay, let me explain.

386
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,720
 This is important, this is the philosophical part.

387
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,800
 I've got a swing in my yard.

388
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,640
 My kids love it.

389
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,040
 It's a rope swing, and it's got this little wooden disc

390
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,840
 that hangs down, and I took a rope,

391
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,720
 hung it from the limb, and then tied a knot

392
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,440
 under the hole in the board, and so they get it.

393
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,680
 And they are so trusting of this swing.

394
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,960
 I mean, they'll run and jump as high as they can,

395
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,640
 and just grab it, and then sit on it,

396
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,480
 and they'll swing, and then they'll push each other,

397
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,160
 and you know, all the while, and there's this like,

398
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,120
 these bricks underneath them that I'm always afraid

399
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,000
 it's gonna fall, but they're like, "It's permanent.

400
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,900
 "It's unbreakable.

401
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,080
 "Daddy made it, it's perfect."

402
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
 And one day it fell.

403
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,320
 The knot slipped through the hole, and the swing fell down.

404
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,360
 And so that thing that they thought was unbreakable,

405
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,480
 now they can't unlearn that it's breakable.

406
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,400
 And so they approach the swing with fear and trepidation.

407
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,600
 They approach the swing with a greater concern.

408
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,760
 They approach the swing knowing of what it's capable of.

409
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,080
 See also how you approach marriage.

410
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,180
 When God said, "No, no, you find someone,

411
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,720
 "you commit to them for a lifetime, it's unbreakable."

412
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,080
 And you're like, "No, I can't learn.

413
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,080
 "I can't unlearn that that's not unbreakable.

414
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,720
 "All I've seen is breakable."

415
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,360
 It's not all your fault.

416
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,560
 Okay, this is not your fault.

417
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,600
 I mean, it's your problem.

418
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,820
 We've gotta redeem this, we've gotta change this,

419
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,920
 but this, you know, this is what our parents did to us.

420
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,080
 This is what our grandparents did to us

421
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,880
 when they introduced divorce.

422
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,200
 It's not your mistake.

423
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,040
 But we've gotta redefine it as God intended for it to be.

424
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,640
 Sex, when God invented sex, because he did,

425
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,240
 it was his idea, it was such a great idea, God, way to go.

426
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,600
 He made the parts, he made 'em work the way they do,

427
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,920
 he made it feel the way it does,

428
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,040
 and he says this is permanent.

429
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,120
 The scripture says, "For this reason,

430
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,140
 "a man will leave his father and mother

431
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,980
 "and be united to his wife,

432
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,320
 "and the two will become one flesh.

433
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,880
 "There will be a mingling of souls that happens.

434
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,140
 "Two people will become one person forever

435
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,280
 "and ever and ever."

436
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,180
 We don't know that sex.

437
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,800
 No one in this room, no one on the planet knows that sex.

438
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,280
 You say, "No, no, no, bro, I'm a virgin."

439
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,680
 It doesn't matter.

440
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,080
 You grew up in a world where that sex has been redefined.

441
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,040
 Through magazines and media,

442
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,160
 you don't know of a permanent sex.

443
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,020
 You only know of a temporary sex,

444
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,320
 a sex that happens for the pursuit of pleasure,

445
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,200
 not for the pursuit of permanence.

446
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,120
 You see what I'm saying?

447
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,580
 This is all because of the lens

448
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,640
 that we see commitment through because of the fall.

449
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,200
 So any time in America's history,

450
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,080
 any time looking backwards, guys, this is crazy.

451
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,940
 People got married younger and marriages last longer.

452
00:18:53,940 --> 00:19:01,420
 We are the worst at marriage than anyone who ever has been.

453
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,340
 We get married later and our marriages

454
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,860
 don't last as long as they used to.

455
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,660
 Why?

456
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,140
 Crazy answer, this is the philosophical part.

457
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,180
 Information.

458
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,240
 That's why.

459
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,800
 What happened when her eyes were opened

460
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,560
 and now she had a greater knowledge that she was naked

461
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,780
 and she felt shame?

462
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,800
 We have a greater knowledge that marriages can break up

463
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,700
 and so what do we do?

464
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,600
 We're like, we gotta find the one.

465
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,140
 We gotta make it work.

466
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,440
 We gotta find the one where, you know,

467
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,960
 this thing is so fragile, it's so temporary,

468
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,340
 it can easily break, so we gotta find the right one

469
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,780
 so we can be with them forever

470
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,060
 and it's not about just finding the one,

471
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,780
 it's about finding a one who loves God

472
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,380
 and meets all of the things that he says they should be

473
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,380
 and committing to them and I promise

474
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,660
 you're gonna fall out of love with them,

475
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,100
 you're not gonna wanna be with them,

476
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,400
 there's gonna be times where they disgust you

477
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,580
 and you say, but I said until death do us part,

478
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,660
 richer or poorer, sickness and health,

479
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,740
 when I don't even feel in love with you,

480
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,060
 I'm committed to you

481
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:15,560
 because you will feel that way, I promise.

482
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,220
 Everybody else is sleeping, one person's like,

483
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,020
 oh man, I'm awake, I'm awake.

484
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,420
 Thanks, thanks mom, glad you're here.

485
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,420
 [audience laughing]

486
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:32,820
 God designed us to belong to his body, the church,

487
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,700
 but let's be honest, we've seen church leaders

488
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,340
 fail miserably, we've seen them commit adultery,

489
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,820
 we've seen them caught in pornography,

490
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,920
 even child pornography, we've seen them

491
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,360
 be the biggest hypocrites of the biggest kind

492
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,900
 and we've seen the church fall

493
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,820
 and we've been a part of imperfect churches

494
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,700
 that have abused us and used us and take advantage of us

495
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,120
 and taken us for granted and so what do we say?

496
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,340
 We're like, hey, I don't need the institution,

497
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,540
 the church exists to make some people rich,

498
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,780
 I've seen this guy on TV, he's a joke

499
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,020
 and so I don't need to be a part of that,

500
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,800
 I can kinda have my own church, man, I'm a Christian

501
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,580
 and we've redefined the commitment to the church

502
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,260
 because of our own bad experiences through humans

503
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,420
 and I promise you, you're human

504
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,980
 and your church leaders are human

505
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,140
 and as an imperfect human, you don't want a perfect church

506
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,940
 'cause if you found it and you went there, you'd ruin it

507
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,940
 because you're imperfect and Christ is in the process

508
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,820
 of perfecting us through sanctification to glorification,

509
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,740
 that's his work, not ours and because it's imperfect,

510
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,560
 it doesn't mean you shouldn't commit to it,

511
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,140
 you should go all in, man, all in.

512
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,140
 And so why have we gotten worse at marriage

513
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:59,780
 and church attendance and career choices?

514
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,140
 Because we've given ourselves too many options,

515
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,540
 that's the second thing, first reason is 'cause we're afraid

516
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,980
 of what we'll miss out on, the second one is

517
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,340
 because we've given ourselves too many options.

518
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:14,080
 There's now a sense that you might marry the wrong person,

519
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,680
 in Jesus' day, you had limited options, you know?

520
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
 Your dad would show up and be like, hey, this is your husband

521
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,740
 and you'd be like, okay, I got one option.

522
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,040
 [congregation laughing]

523
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,900
 And we love variety even in churches.

524
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,700
 I don't really want the same pastor week after week

525
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,360
 after week, I want a variety, I want the best,

526
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,640
 like where's the teaching the best,

527
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,080
 where's the most entertaining, where's the funniest,

528
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,240
 where's the worship really good?

529
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,160
 And we approach church like a buffet,

530
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,980
 like in Jesus' day, it was like you would show up,

531
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,800
 you'd go to the church that existed in your city,

532
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,880
 the church of Colossae, the church of Thessalonica,

533
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,000
 the church of Philippi, the church of Rome,

534
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,420
 and you'd pray not to die.

535
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,520
 Like it was a good day if none of your friends

536
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,520
 got set on fire, like that was a win.

537
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,800
 Hey, let's gather and let's learn the word of God

538
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,960
 because we may not have it tomorrow.

539
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,800
 Let's feast and celebrate what Jesus has done for us.

540
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,840
 And you weren't a consumer, you were a contributor

541
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,960
 in the very, every essence of the word.

542
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,240
 Too many options for jobs.

543
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,120
 Your great-grandfather was a farmer

544
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,240
 'cause his dad was a farmer and his dad was a farmer.

545
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,080
 Here's what your great-great-grandfather never did,

546
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,080
 he never was like, hey man, I need to take Myers-Briggs

547
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,580
 and find out what I'm good at.

548
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,880
 [congregation laughing]

549
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,560
 I read this book called Strengths Finder

550
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,200
 and man, I really think, I got the gift of woo

551
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,480
 and I think I could be, do this thing over here

552
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,560
 and what are my options?

553
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,280
 I'm gonna go on monster.com and really see

554
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,480
 what's available to me.

555
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,980
 No, he never did that.

556
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,960
 He's like, I'm a farmer.

557
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,280
 He never was like, well, where do my passions intersect

558
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,200
 the greatest need and where's the overlap

559
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,640
 and let me contribute there.

560
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,000
 No, he just did the job that was in front of him

561
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,640
 really well to the glory of God.

562
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,820
 That's a new problem.

563
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,320
 All of those things I said, they're funny

564
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,920
 'cause you heard 'em, you said 'em.

565
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
 People said 'em to you.

566
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,880
 But the Bible says you do the job that's in front of you

567
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,840
 and you do it well to the glory of God.

568
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,720
 [congregation laughing]

569
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,920
 Here's a legit study.

570
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,720
 This was in Time Magazine.

571
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,560
 It was completed by the Columbia University

572
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,040
 and I just find it interesting.

573
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,480
 Here's what happened.

574
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,800
 They found that even in simple purchases

575
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,800
 like the purchase of jams, jelly, if you will,

576
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,400
 that you were less likely to buy

577
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,240
 if you had too many options.

578
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,960
 And so what they did in this case study

579
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
 is they had two stores and they arranged

580
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,320
 different assortments of jams.

581
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,520
 And so the two options were 50 jams and 10 jams.

582
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,920
 Those were on display for you to choose one.

583
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,960
 And so 60% of the customers went to the place

584
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,260
 where there were 50 jams.

585
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,880
 They wanted more options.

586
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,520
 We all think that more options, that's better.

587
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,040
 Everyone that came in here with the preconceived notion

588
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,860
 that hey, if I have more options, that's better.

589
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,840
 That's not what science says

590
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,260
 and not necessarily what God's word says.

591
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,520
 What happened, so 60% went for the large assortment,

592
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,120
 40% stopped by the small one, the one of 10 jams.

593
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,120
 But 30% of the people who had sampled

594
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,640
 from the small assortment decided to buy jam.

595
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,920
 While only 3% of those that confronted

596
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,260
 by the 50 jams decided to buy.

597
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,160
 Do you see what happened?

598
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,520
 Okay, you're like, no, bro, I'm so confused.

599
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,960
 Two jams, 10 and 50.

600
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,780
 More people wanted to go and select from the 50,

601
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,880
 but the people that went to select from the 50,

602
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,840
 only 3% purchased.

603
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,680
 The fewer that went to select from the 10, 30% purchased.

604
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,040
 Because fewer options is easier to drive to a decision

605
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,000
 and this is what I want you to take away from that.

606
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,400
 Research also shows that an excess of choices

607
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,740
 often leads us to be less, not more satisfied

608
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,280
 once we actually decide.

609
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,760
 There's often that nagging feeling

610
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,220
 we could have done better, amen.

611
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,760
 We're over committed, the reason we don't commit

612
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,520
 is 'cause we're over committed to the wrong things.

613
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,800
 Our schedule is full of commitments that are irrelevant.

614
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,040
 Like I talk to people all the time,

615
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,320
 they're like, man, I'm too busy.

616
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,920
 I'm too busy and like in the same sentence,

617
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,480
 they're like, man, I never miss SportsCenter though.

618
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,360
 Dude, I'm way too busy.

619
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,040
 But I'm having this bachelor party tonight,

620
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,040
 everybody's coming over, we watch The Bachelor, it's amazing.

621
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,280
 No, bro, you don't understand,

622
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,860
 I can't serve at the porch, I'm way too busy.

623
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,700
 But dude, Downton Abbey, have you seen that?

624
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,080
 It's like we don't miss an episode.

625
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,080
 I'm like, okay, you're not too busy,

626
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,240
 you just prioritize things different.

627
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,080
 You have commitments in your life,

628
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,160
 they're just different commitments.

629
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,760
 You've over committed to some things

630
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,840
 that maybe you shouldn't be committed to

631
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,520
 or you might wanna reconsider.

632
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,640
 And so why should we move toward commitment?

633
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,040
 'Cause one, the reason you should move toward commitment

634
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,920
 because without it, you won't complete anything.

635
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,000
 You can't get married without commitment.

636
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,660
 You can't follow Christ without commitment.

637
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,180
 Can't even read your Bible without commitment.

638
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,780
 Without commitment, you won't follow through.

639
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,620
 And here's a greater reason,

640
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,700
 if that doesn't resonate with you,

641
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,220
 the most beautiful things in life come by way of commitment.

642
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,340
 The most beautiful things in the world

643
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,100
 come to you through commitment.

644
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,480
 Let me explain what I mean.

645
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,100
 I have this friend that we used to hang out with

646
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,020
 and we would hang out in his apartment

647
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,260
 and he could play the guitar and he was amazing.

648
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,040
 And he could entertain us for hours.

649
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,680
 He would just grab a guitar, he'd play everything

650
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,720
 from like Boyz II Men to Metallica

651
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,360
 and everything in between, like gospel music,

652
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,560
 country music, Garth Brooks, George Strait.

653
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,080
 Like he would just jam on this guitar

654
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,600
 and he would sing and we would just listen

655
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,520
 and it was incredible.

656
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,360
 And so I was like, after hanging out with him

657
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,960
 for a little while, I was like, dude, I gotta learn it.

658
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,720
 I want to learn how to play the guitar.

659
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,560
 I really want to.

660
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,840
 So I signed up for guitar lessons.

661
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,920
 I went once, I left frustrated.

662
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,780
 I went twice, I never went back again.

663
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,780
 But here's the deal, the desire was there.

664
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,040
 I want to know how to play the guitar.

665
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,480
 I'm not willing to commit to what it takes

666
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,320
 to play the guitar.

667
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,440
 I love watching B strum the guitar.

668
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,600
 I love worshiping with these guys.

669
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,720
 Are we glad they're back?

670
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,600
 It's just, you know, I love, love hanging out.

671
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,960
 And I watch him and I'm like, dude,

672
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,240
 I want to play the guitar like that.

673
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,240
 But I don't realize that's thousands and thousands

674
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,380
 of hours strumming that guitar to learn to play like that.

675
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,800
 The most beautiful things in life

676
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,600
 come by way of commitment.

677
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,560
 I mean, anybody can pick up a guitar and strum it.

678
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,080
 But to make it beautiful, you have to commit.

679
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,940
 It's long obedience in the same direction.

680
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,920
 And our generation has forgotten this.

681
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,400
 We've forsaken this idea.

682
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,440
 And so how can we make the right commitments?

683
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,280
 This is my second point.

684
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,680
 How can we make the right commitments?

685
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,600
 Number one, and I'm just gonna give counterpoints

686
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,640
 to the four points I gave you under the first point.

687
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,660
 Number one, you understand that with Christ,

688
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,480
 you won't miss out on anything good.

689
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,120
 Now, this is so important.

690
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,080
 If you're here and you're a follower of Jesus,

691
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,960
 you gotta understand that in the gospel,

692
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,020
 you are made complete, not all at once.

693
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,040
 I mean, you are declared righteous all at once.

694
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,500
 But you will never get to heaven.

695
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,600
 I say this often here.

696
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,360
 You're never gonna get to heaven and regret.

697
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,280
 In fact, if there's any regret in heaven,

698
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,220
 and I don't believe there is, but if there is,

699
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,520
 it's only I regret that I didn't follow God more.

700
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,840
 I regret I didn't share the gospel more.

701
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,840
 I regret I didn't work harder to bring the kingdom there.

702
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,560
 But you're never gonna be like, man, I can't believe

703
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,920
 they all went and got sushi and didn't call me.

704
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,920
 Like, God, before I come in, we gotta talk about that, man.

705
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,040
 It's just been bothering me.

706
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,960
 Everybody's a blue fish, but me, what's up with that?

707
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,240
 It won't ever happen.

708
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,640
 And so when you miss out on that opportunity,

709
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,440
 you can remind yourself that in the gospel,

710
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,700
 I will experience the full completeness of life.

711
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,960
 John 10:10 says, "For I have come

712
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,960
 "so that they might have life," this is Jesus,

713
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,080
 "and have it to the fullest."

714
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,760
 And then in the Psalms, he says this, check this out.

715
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,760
 Psalm 84, verse 11, "No good thing does he withhold

716
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,900
 "from those whose walk is blameless."

717
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,680
 You're not missing out on anything.

718
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,360
 And thinking that you are, frankly, is idolatry.

719
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,080
 You have some idol of man, some need for approval,

720
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,800
 some fear of man, something in you is not complete

721
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,620
 when you sit there and you regret

722
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,400
 and mourn the reality that you were left out.

723
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,160
 You have an identity issue, an idolatry issue.

724
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,560
 And the solution is going to be leaning into Christ,

725
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,440
 having others pray for you in that.

726
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:46,360
 Secondly, you remove bad options.

727
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,840
 We said that the reason we don't commit

728
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,400
 is 'cause we have too many options.

729
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,980
 And so you remove the bad options.

730
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,540
 Like, here's the deal, like, and this is good news,

731
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,100
 don't hear this as bad news.

732
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,520
 Some of you desire marriage.

733
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,720
 The pool from which you can marry, it's a really small pool.

734
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,080
 Like, if you're on Tinder,

735
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,080
 like, you can eliminate 99% of Tinder.

736
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,240
 It's a really small, like, I'm assuming you're here,

737
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,600
 you're a follower of Jesus, you're like, I follow Jesus.

738
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,580
 I'm a Christian, I'm fully committed to Christ, right?

739
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,160
 It's a really small pool.

740
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,840
 And that's not bad news, that's good news.

741
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,240
 Like, they're probably in the room right now

742
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,040
 or they're probably on this campus

743
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,140
 or some other church campus a whole lot,

744
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,380
 serving there, giving there, being taught there,

745
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,520
 being instructed there.

746
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,440
 I'm assuming, you know, again,

747
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,920
 if you're a believer in Christ,

748
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,360
 the one that you're gonna spend the rest of your life with

749
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,520
 most likely is spending a ton of time

750
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,520
 on a church campus somewhere in Dallas going all in.

751
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,840
 And it's a relatively small pool.

752
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,120
 I mean, it's a minority,

753
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,780
 as you consider everyone on the planet.

754
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,640
 It's a relatively small section of the planet.

755
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,280
 And so you remove the bad options,

756
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,860
 this actually helps you and moves you towards a commitment.

757
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,080
 Jesus said, you see all throughout the Old Testament,

758
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,200
 God said, hey, don't marry these,

759
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
 don't marry the Canaanites, don't marry these people.

760
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,040
 You know, this is the small section that you can marry from.

761
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,780
 In fact, I want you to travel back to that land

762
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,620
 to find a wife.

763
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,000
 We see that in the Old Testament,

764
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,720
 the New Testament, 2 Corinthians 6, 14,

765
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,440
 do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers.

766
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,760
 And God says, hey, no, no, if you're my people,

767
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,080
 then you find my people and you produce my people

768
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,440
 and pour into my people and disciple my people.

769
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,440
 The first great commission, like we talked about last week.

770
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,120
 And so as you remove bad options,

771
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,560
 I would just tell you as you consider a job,

772
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,360
 you weren't made to do everything.

773
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,240
 Like maybe your parents said, you can do anything.

774
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,080
 No, you can't.

775
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,000
 There's some things you'd be really, really bad at.

776
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,240
 [congregation laughing]

777
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,080
 Okay?

778
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,640
 You weren't meant to do everything.

779
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,760
 God prepared works for you

780
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,960
 before the beginning of creation for you to walk in.

781
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,780
 And as you rely on him, as you lean in him,

782
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,780
 as you walk with him, you walk in them.

783
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:00,000
 Okay, you were made to do some specific things

784
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,760
 that he has for you, not anything.

785
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,180
 Some specific things.

786
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,160
 And I would say anything that doesn't honor God

787
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,820
 is not an option.

788
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,160
 So as you're considering your options,

789
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,480
 you can ask, well, does this honor God?

790
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,120
 And if the answer's no, then you can remove that

791
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,960
 as an option.

792
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,360
 That's no longer an option for me.

793
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,760
 So we talked about last week in considering your purpose.

794
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,920
 And then lastly, I would just say,

795
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,800
 if you're over-committed to some of the wrong things,

796
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,460
 commit to the right things.

797
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,440
 What are the right things?

798
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,920
 The right things are church.

799
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,520
 And I don't just mean attending a church.

800
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,800
 I mean, being a member at a church.

801
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,480
 You know, you're sitting right there right now.

802
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,440
 You're sitting in a chair.

803
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,480
 You're like, hey, I'm a Christian.

804
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,440
 I'm a follower of Jesus.

805
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,840
 Are you a member of a church?

806
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,680
 Well, JP, what does it mean?

807
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,500
 What do you mean?

808
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,340
 I mean, I go to a church.

809
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,180
 What does it mean to be a member?

810
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,580
 It means to be elders there that are aware that you're there

811
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,140
 and you're under their authority

812
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,780
 so that you can learn from them,

813
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,100
 submit to their teaching so that you'd be a blessing,

814
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,940
 not a burden.

815
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,500
 That's what Hebrews 13, 17 says.

816
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,340
 That you're there.

817
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,160
 You're like, hey, I'm here,

818
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,440
 and I'm a contributor, not a consumer.

819
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,280
 I'm here.

820
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,700
 I'm a part of this body, and I'm known.

821
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,980
 If you're not here, if you're not a member of a church,

822
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,300
 you're not, what is it?

823
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,740
 Well, I'll just, I'll save that in a second.

824
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,960
 Here's what I would say.

825
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,640
 You are not, you are missing out on the fullness of life

826
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,140
 that God has intended for you.

827
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,520
 As he writes to the church in Thessalonica,

828
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,800
 the church in Philippi,

829
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,160
 and I've seen people take this small step.

830
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,520
 I see some of you out there right now.

831
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,160
 You've taken this small step, and you just said,

832
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,000
 hey, you know what?

833
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,820
 I'm here.

834
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,660
 I'm thinking, you know, I've never really been in church.

835
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,880
 I was at my parents' church,

836
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,460
 but I've never really been a member of my own,

837
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,480
 but now I'm all adult now,

838
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
 so I'm gonna become a member,

839
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,000
 and you take that small step,

840
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,080
 and then all of a sudden,

841
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,640
 God begins to use you in incredible ways

842
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,840
 and set you free in beautiful and magnificent ways

843
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,520
 through that commitment, and that's important.

844
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,840
 Community, small group.

845
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,560
 If you're a member of this church,

846
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,660
 this weekend we have this deal called Group Link.

847
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,640
 If you're here, you know that you don't have

848
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,680
 a small group of brothers and sisters

849
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,760
 that you meet with on a regular basis

850
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,440
 to go through life.

851
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,420
 We wanna help with that.

852
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,400
 We wanna change that.

853
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,780
 I believe that it's one of the smallest steps

854
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,400
 you can take to receive the biggest return on investment

855
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,760
 outside of trusting in Christ.

856
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,940
 God has blessed me more through the context of community

857
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,440
 than any other thing in my life.

858
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,240
 He saved my marriage through community,

859
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,080
 and so if you're here and you're like,

860
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,400
 you know what, I'm not in a small group,

861
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,440
 I'm not in a community group

862
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,780
 that I meet with on a weekly basis

863
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,400
 for the purpose of knowing God and making him known,

864
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,680
 let's change that.

865
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,080
 Tonight, if you wanna hear more about that,

866
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,760
 guys can go through this hallway.

867
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,600
 There's gonna be a room there.

868
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,480
 Girls can go through this hallway.

869
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,400
 There's gonna be a room there,

870
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,800
 and they'd love to talk with you more about that.

871
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,940
 (chuckles)

872
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,980
 Commit to serving somewhere,

873
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,660
 using your gifts and talents,

874
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,660
 and then listen, here's what I wanna tell you.

875
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,580
 Commit to Christ.

876
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:49,500
 Like some of you, you're like, I'm a Christian.

877
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,220
 I'm not talking about check the box Christian.

878
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,020
 I'm talking about going all in with Jesus.

879
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,020
 And do you know that if you,

880
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,900
 like I could say, hey man, commit to purity.

881
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,740
 If you're committed to Christ, you're committed to purity.

882
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,720
 They'd be like, hey man, you need to commit to sobriety.

883
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,040
 If you're committed to Jesus, you're committed to sobriety.

884
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,280
 You know, if you're committed to Jesus,

885
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,280
 you're committed to church.

886
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,040
 If you're committed to Jesus, you're committed to community.

887
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,600
 If you're committed to Christ, you're committed to service.

888
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,720
 The Spirit of God living inside of you

889
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,620
 is producing these things through you.

890
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,200
 And so if you're just gonna do one,

891
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,780
 commit to Jesus, go all in with Jesus.

892
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,400
 Not like, hey, it's a good idea.

893
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,760
 No, God, I'm here and I'm yours,

894
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,640
 and I got a few years left, maybe.

895
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,260
 Should God willing use the rest of my life?

896
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,940
 I've wasted so much of my life behind me.

897
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,220
 Would you take it from here?

898
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,600
 And I look out there and I see some of you

899
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,080
 that have done that, and it has made all the difference.

900
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,060
 It has made all the difference.

901
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:48,220
 Christianity moved, Christ moved from an idea to a life.

902
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:54,400
 So,

903
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,320
 as you consider these things, like why they're important,

904
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,000
 why does this matter?

905
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,640
 It's unbelievable what the Scripture says in and about this.

906
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,600
 He just says in Jesus, when he gives a sermon on the mount,

907
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,040
 he says, he's talking about the most important things,

908
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,500
 and he says, hey, you need to keep your commitments.

909
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,720
 He says that, and also it says in the Scriptures

910
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,520
 in Numbers 30, all throughout the Old Testament,

911
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,200
 God says, hey, this is important.

912
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,280
 I want you to keep your commitments.

913
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,400
 Psalm 15, one, in verse four, says this.

914
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,080
 The Lord, he says, Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent,

915
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,040
 who may live on your holy mountain,

916
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,360
 who keeps an oath even when it hurts

917
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,080
 and does not change their mind.

918
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,520
 Who's your man or woman, God?

919
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,920
 The one who keeps an oath, even when it hurts,

920
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,320
 even when it costs them something,

921
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,000
 even when they feel like they're missing out on something,

922
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,440
 and they don't change their mind.

923
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,000
 That's my man, that's my woman.

924
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,920
 So why does this matter is my third point.

925
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,120
 Why does this matter?

926
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,440
 Because it's consistent with God's character.

927
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,600
 God keeps his commitments.

928
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,880
 Like your whole faith is based on the reality,

929
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,380
 the concept, the promise,

930
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,640
 that God keeps his commitments, right?

931
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,720
 Numbers 23, verse 19, God is not human,

932
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,880
 that he should lie, not a human being,

933
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,160
 that he should change his mind.

934
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,760
 Does he speak and then not act?

935
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,760
 Does he promise and not fulfill?

936
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,400
 And then Titus 1, 2 says, in the hope of eternal life,

937
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,160
 which God, who does not lie,

938
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,600
 promised before the beginning of time.

939
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,600
 And so we live with the hope that God keeps his commitments

940
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,000
 and Jesus is the proof of that, right?

941
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,440
 For who, for the joy set before him endured the cross.

942
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,320
 What if Jesus didn't keep his commitments?

943
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,920
 He's in the garden and he says, Lord, not my will, period.

944
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,880
 No, I don't want to.

945
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,240
 I'm out, it's gonna hurt.

946
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,640
 But that's not what he does.

947
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,040
 He says, not my will, but Lord, he's like,

948
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,060
 God, I don't want to.

949
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:54,900
 I don't want to.

950
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,600
 I'm seeing that thing and it looks like

951
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,500
 they're gonna slowly kill me on it and I don't want to,

952
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,460
 but I will do whatever honors you.

953
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,000
 And if you're gonna, you don't like to deal with your sin,

954
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,480
 like nobody, I've sat with a lot of girls,

955
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,680
 they don't like to talk about their abortion.

956
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,520
 I've sat with a lot of guys,

957
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,640
 they don't love to talk about their pornography struggles.

958
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,660
 And vice versa.

959
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,360
 People don't like to talk about their debt.

960
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,600
 We don't like to talk about their sin.

961
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,700
 Jesus didn't like enduring all of it at once.

962
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,020
 All of your abortions went on him,

963
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,120
 all of your pornography went on him,

964
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,400
 all of your sex before marriage,

965
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,820
 you're sitting here and you feel shame.

966
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,680
 You feel shame, why?

967
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,080
 Because you think the cross wasn't good enough.

968
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,240
 It was good enough.

969
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,560
 As Shane said, it is finished.

970
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,560
 It's finished, it's paid for, it's done.

971
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,380
 And now you walk in freedom and in commitment.

972
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,000
 And you're here and you're like, well, JP, listen, man.

973
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,400
 Okay, that's cool and all, but what about when I gotta,

974
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,920
 what about when I commit and I gotta take it back?

975
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,640
 I'm gonna give you something, this is free, write it down.

976
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,040
 It's really practical, okay?

977
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,960
 This is really practical, it really helped me.

978
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,200
 I'm gonna give it to you.

979
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,040
 When you commit to something, when you say,

980
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,240
 hey, I'll be there Tuesday at seven,

981
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,760
 what you've done is you've given the gift of your time.

982
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,800
 And then all of a sudden you find out

983
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,000
 your grandmother's coming into town

984
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,720
 and you've gotta see her Tuesday at seven.

985
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,200
 And so you call that friend who you said,

986
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,680
 hey, I'll be there Tuesday at seven,

987
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,320
 and you say, hey, I just found out

988
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,280
 that my grandmother's in town.

989
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,640
 You don't manage information.

990
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,980
 You say, hey, this is what's going on.

991
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,420
 Not something came up, this is what's going on.

992
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,480
 May I please have that commitment back?

993
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,880
 I gave you the gift of my time Tuesday at seven.

994
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,180
 I gave you a commitment, I gave it to you as a gift.

995
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,320
 May I please have that back?

996
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,200
 Would you give me that commitment back?

997
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,280
 And they can say yes, no, or maybe.

998
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,200
 And if they say no, you say, all right, I'm sorry, Grandma.

999
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,200
 I committed and I wanna live a life above reproach

1000
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,560
 and I'm gonna honor my commitment.

1001
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,760
 And I don't think you'll get up to heaven and be like,

1002
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,760
 God'll be like, hey, shame on you,

1003
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,060
 you kept your commitments.

1004
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,240
 Did you catch that?

1005
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,000
 When you give someone a commitment,

1006
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,860
 you've given them a gift, and if you need it back,

1007
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,400
 you simply ask for it back and you tell them clearly why.

1008
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,600
 Can I have that back?

1009
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,600
 It's free.

1010
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:10,960
 We talk about how God calls people to a church.

1011
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,560
 David Platt said, "Biblically, Christians are not

1012
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,840
 "church avoiders, attenders, hoppers, or shoppers.

1013
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,160
 "Biblically, Christians are church members."

1014
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,520
 And then Todd Wagner, this is the quote

1015
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,080
 I was gonna say earlier.

1016
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,120
 "A regular attender is a misnomer.

1017
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,200
 "You are an irregular believer."

1018
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,760
 And I hear all the time, I'm like,

1019
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,600
 hey, are you a church member?

1020
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,320
 No, no, man, I'll be moving soon.

1021
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,300
 Cool, be a member 'til you move.

1022
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,640
 That's a good reason to transfer membership.

1023
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,280
 Are you a church, do you member somewhere?

1024
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,480
 No, man, I work at night.

1025
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,440
 Oh, cool, man, well, let's consider

1026
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,460
 what membership would look like and we can find a time

1027
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,560
 that works for you or a time to stream or something,

1028
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,440
 but you can still be under the authority.

1029
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,480
 Of church leadership.

1030
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,040
 And can I just shoot you real straight?

1031
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,680
 I've never in my entire eight years of vocational ministry

1032
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,640
 heard any good reason for someone not to belong

1033
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,240
 to a church, ever, not once.

1034
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,320
 It doesn't exist, so if you're here and you're like,

1035
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,600
 man, I think I've got a good reason,

1036
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,760
 I'll be up front afterwards, I'd love to hear it.

1037
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,920
 I'd be really curious and I'll apologize next week.

1038
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,160
 I'll be like, hey, guys, I heard a good reason.

1039
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,080
 [congregation laughing]

1040
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,380
 Serving the body, belonging to a small group,

1041
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,200
 committed to your spouse, you're like,

1042
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,480
 I'm not married, cool, committed to your spouse.

1043
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,700
 Looks like praying for 'em, saving yourself for them,

1044
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,060
 being committed to purity,

1045
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:29,720
 asking God to bring them at the right time,

1046
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,180
 trusting his timing.

1047
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,340
 If you wanna be married, looking for them actively, guys.

1048
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:39,960
 And I'm just gonna say it again.

1049
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,160
 Committed to Christ, if you've heard nothing else.

1050
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,860
 You go all in with Jesus and you're gonna be just fine.

1051
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,200
 It's so crazy 'cause I had this illustration in here

1052
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,040
 about a Maasai warrior.

1053
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,360
 I was in Africa once and in the Maasai mara,

1054
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,320
 we got to sit with the Maasai warriors.

1055
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,520
 These are the guys, they kill their food with spears

1056
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,480
 and they're in the jungle and they have the long earlobes

1057
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,960
 and the neck things and the neck rings and all that.

1058
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,000
 These are the Maasai people and I was talking with them

1059
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,740
 and when I came back, somebody had sent this to me

1060
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,920
 and I just thought this was excellent

1061
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,560
 so I wanna read it to you.

1062
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,900
 Vincent Donovan tells of a conversation

1063
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,140
 with a Maasai elder about the word for faith.

1064
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,700
 And so they're trying to find a word for faith

1065
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,060
 that translates to their language

1066
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,300
 and the elder contended that the word that they chose

1067
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,000
 in his language was unsatisfactory

1068
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,520
 because it meant only to agree to.

1069
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,180
 He said that it was similar to a white hunter

1070
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:38,080
 shooting an animal with his gun from a great distance.

1071
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,720
 Only his eyes and his fingers took part in the act.

1072
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,580
 "We should find another word," he said.

1073
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,680
 He said, "For a man really to commit to Christ

1074
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,960
 "is like a lion going after its prey.

1075
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,700
 "His nose and his eyes and his ears pick up the prey.

1076
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,580
 "His legs give him the speed to catch it.

1077
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,440
 "All the power of his body is involved

1078
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,800
 "in the terrible death leap and single blow to the neck

1079
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,620
 "with the front paw, the blow that actually kills.

1080
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,080
 "And as the animal goes down,

1081
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,340
 "the lion envelops it in his arms,

1082
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,400
 "pulls it to himself and makes it a part of himself.

1083
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,180
 "This is the way the lion kills.

1084
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,640
 "This is the way a man believes.

1085
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,080
 "This is what faith is.

1086
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,620
 "This is commitment to Christ."

1087
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:30,120
 (congregation applauding)

1088
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:34,720
 This is what God wants from you.

1089
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,000
 That you would go all in with him.

1090
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,760
 What if FOMO is causing you to miss out

1091
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,720
 on the greatness that God has for you?

1092
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,000
 What if you're sitting there and you're getting rich

1093
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,200
 and you're having fun and you're pursuing pleasure

1094
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,840
 and you're missing out on life,

1095
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,440
 a life that you were called to,

1096
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,760
 a greater life that was meant for you

1097
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,560
 through full commitment and devotion to Jesus?

1098
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,520
 You know if you're living that kind of commitment or not.

1099
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,040
 You hear that and you know, you're like,

1100
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,000
 "Man, that's me, man.

1101
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,680
 "I'm walking with Jesus like a lion kills its prey."

1102
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,800
 Or, "I'm walking with Jesus like a hunter from afar."

1103
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:27,240
 My eyes, my fingers, small movement, small commitment.

1104
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,720
 And I've seen this, man.

1105
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,120
 Talking to my friend Ryan and Sylvia earlier.

1106
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:38,200
 And just how this commitment, this one decision

1107
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,020
 changed everything in their life.

1108
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,520
 My buddy Alan said, "The definition of hell on earth

1109
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,700
 "is having one foot in the world and one foot in the church

1110
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,540
 "'cause you're not committed to either

1111
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,200
 "and you're missing out on both."

1112
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:55,460
 In summary, we fear commitment for many reasons

1113
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,160
 that are all satisfied in a commitment to Christ.

1114
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,980
 And this matters because our belief,

1115
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:05,420
 our very belief system is based on commitment, faith.

1116
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,380
 And here's the problem.

1117
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,220
 This is what I believe.

1118
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,180
 This is what I ask the Lord,

1119
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,120
 what I should share with you tonight.

1120
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,620
 This is what it culminates to.

1121
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:17,900
 I believe that we see commitment through a broken lens.

1122
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,120
 The lens of sin as it entered the world through the fall.

1123
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,380
 And this broken lens of commitment

1124
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,800
 has impacted our view of God

1125
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,360
 because we believe that God the Father loves us

1126
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,340
 maybe like a temporary father.

1127
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,340
 One that was sometimes not there or late to pick us up.

1128
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,860
 Or maybe one that turned his back on us

1129
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,540
 or wasn't there at all.

1130
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,500
 Maybe one we never met.

1131
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,180
 We believe that God in heaven,

1132
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,220
 the one who loves us unconditionally,

1133
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,580
 loves us as others have told us.

1134
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,140
 They loved us unconditionally but failed miserably.

1135
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:51,340
 And so somehow our view of God's radical pursuit

1136
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:54,120
 and commitment to us is tainted by the broken world

1137
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,220
 as its redefined commitment as we know it.

1138
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,460
 And we say, hey, I know God loves me

1139
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,740
 and I've seen the cross and the empty tomb

1140
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:05,200
 and I know the gospel, but it's still broken.

1141
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:09,780
 And he says I've sent my son to die for your sins

1142
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,700
 and I've deposited with you the promise,

1143
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,460
 the seal of the Holy Spirit.

1144
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:17,780
 And we say, yeah, and there's times where we sense that

1145
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,660
 and even feel that.

1146
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:23,420
 But if we're true to ourselves,

1147
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,860
 the majority of our lives are overwhelmed

1148
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,580
 by the brokenness of the world,

1149
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,820
 the stress of the days,

1150
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:32,260
 the pressures of our jobs and relationships.

1151
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:35,180
 And we say, I believe God, God loves me.

1152
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,500
 I think he loves me.

1153
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:41,780
 And we don't understand how he loves you.

1154
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:46,860
 I was out here for baptism, Baptism Sunday.

1155
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,060
 It's just this amazing day.

1156
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,540
 We baptized a couple hundred people

1157
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,860
 and we had bounce houses and hamburgers.

1158
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:54,680
 It's a party.

1159
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,420
 There's a couple, a few thousand people out there

1160
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,780
 and I was making my way through the crowd

1161
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:04,460
 and I saw this boy about four years old

1162
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:09,060
 screaming, I mean crying, sobbing, weeping,

1163
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:12,660
 frantically crying, I mean deep breaths

1164
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,140
 and just to let out screams.

1165
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,740
 And I went up to him and I kind of moved toward him

1166
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,420
 and he jumped back, was afraid of me

1167
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,020
 and I got down low and I said, are you lost?

1168
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:24,260
 And he kind of threw tears and screaming,

1169
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,060
 kind of nodded his head slightly.

1170
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,540
 I said, have you been separated from your parents?

1171
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,780
 He kind of nodded his head.

1172
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,660
 And so I went to pick him up and he wasn't really willing,

1173
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,060
 but I brought him close to me

1174
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,460
 and he kind of held back

1175
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,920
 and I grabbed him by the back of his head.

1176
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,220
 And I said, I will not leave you

1177
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,860
 until I find your parents.

1178
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,140
 I said, I want you to hear me, I will.

1179
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,740
 And he's screaming and I said,

1180
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,980
 will not let you go until you are back

1181
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,500
 with your mom or your dad.

1182
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,220
 I will not let you go until you are back

1183
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,220
 with your mom or dad.

1184
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,900
 I will not let you go.

1185
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,900
 I will not leave you until you are back

1186
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,700
 with your mom and your dad.

1187
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,180
 And he slowly calmed down and I climbed up

1188
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,600
 on the top of a bench and looked around

1189
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,760
 and this woman from afar across the parking lot

1190
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,480
 saw me holding her son and ran for us

1191
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,500
 and I handed her to him and they reunited

1192
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,760
 and she embraced him.

1193
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,780
 It was this beautiful scene

1194
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:21,060
 and that's what the Holy Spirit does right now.

1195
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,440
 He's to you, he said, I will not let you go.

1196
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,560
 This is my promise.

1197
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,500
 I will not let you go until you are back

1198
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,340
 with your father in the fullness of his presence,

1199
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,740
 face to face with your father.

1200
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:33,780
 I will not let you go.

1201
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,520
 You can run, I will chase you.

1202
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,140
 I'm faster.

1203
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,340
 You wanna keep running in that sin,

1204
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,740
 you wanna keep doing those things,

1205
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,700
 you wanna keep committing to the wrong things,

1206
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,120
 but I'm committed to you through it all

1207
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,500
 and I will not let you go until you are back

1208
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,440
 with your father.

1209
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,860
 Until you are in the fullness of his presence,

1210
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,900
 till you see him, till you're all embraced,

1211
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,800
 I will not let you go.

1212
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,140
 This is the Holy Spirit in our life.

1213
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,020
 This is what Jesus gave to us

1214
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,180
 through his death and resurrection on the cross.

1215
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:10,180
 This is God's radical, unwavering, unyielding,

1216
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:15,620
 unstopping, powerful movement and commitment towards you.

1217
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:20,520
 (congregation applauding)

1218
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,700
 Can't wait to be up there with you all.

1219
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,340
 Experience that with you all.

1220
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:30,960
 Don't waste your life here committing to stupid things.

1221
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,360
 Let me pray that we commit to him.

1222
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,120
 And Father, you're so committed to us

1223
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,960
 as you've demonstrated for us in and through the gospel,

1224
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,360
 in and through Jesus, all that you've given to us.

1225
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,200
 You've given up your very own son

1226
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,200
 so that we can be with you forever

1227
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,680
 and you tell us that we've been sealed by your spirit,

1228
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,520
 that you've deposited yourself inside of us

1229
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,960
 as a promise that we will one day be with you again.

1230
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,000
 Would you renew our minds around that promise, Lord?

1231
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,400
 Father, would you help us to know you?

1232
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,440
 Would you help us to believe you?

1233
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,120
 Would you help us to realize that commitment to us?

1234
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:15,860
 Fathers, there's friends here

1235
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,480
 that feel like they're faster than you,

1236
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,360
 that they've ran past your reach.

1237
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:24,840
 Would you remind them or show them for the first time

1238
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,880
 that that's not true?

1239
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,280
 Lord, thank you for the life that you've given us in Jesus.

1240
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,280
 Thank you for all that you're doing here in and through us.

1241
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,720
 in here, in and through us.
