00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 All right, we welcome friends in the room.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Friends, get excited.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Friends in Fort Worth, Houston, El Paso, and any of the other 15, Tulsa, Woodlands,

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 any of the other 15 or 16 Portslide locations.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hey, we are continuing this series, "Before There Were Kings."

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I'm going to start with telling a little bit about my family life,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 specifically my son. That will give us some direction for where we're going.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I have a 3-year-old son named Crew.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 He's one of two children we have. This is him. There he is.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Oh, yeah, just rocking those Velcro shoes, man. Got to.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Here's what I love about my son, and I'm grieving because I know the day is going to come when this is going to change.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 He's at that age where there is not an insecure bone in this kid's body.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 He's as confident as he could possibly be, I mean, in so many different ways,

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 whether it's the fact that, like, dude, I don't have to wear pants at any time.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 No pants, no problem. Let's do this thing.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 He wants to be--his probably preferred dress code would be just walking around in underwear.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And he's going to be ecstatic to show you the different designs that he has on his undergarments.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 He is not afraid to go out. If he's got food all over his face, that's just a normal thing for him.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 There's not an insecure part of his life.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 He's so confident that he wants to make sure that any new trait that he has picked up,

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 he will just very quickly move to make sure strangers know what he can do.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 What do I mean by that? I mean, like, he recently learned how to jump, which is a big accomplishment when you're 3.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And by jump, I mean he literally leaves the ground like the size of a nickel.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 But he could be--he will be so stoked.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 So he'll go up to, like, complete strangers and be like, "Hey, you want to see me jump?"

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And he'll--what's up now?

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And he'll get so excited, he'll, like, run around in circles.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And it's like, I don't know who's--who's this kid's parents.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 He gets this from his mother. She's always doing that kind of thing.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 "You want to see me jump?"

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And he just has so much confidence inside of his life.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 He is just willing to go to one stranger to the next, and he'll just say,

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 "Hey, have you heard me sing the alphabet song?"

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 And he'll just go from one person to the next, and he'll just very quickly move through.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 He wants to make sure you know all the different skills and confidence that he has.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 And the reason I say as a dad, one thing that I've been thinking of is I get sad about the reality

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 that there's going to come a day where that security and confidence no longer is what it is currently

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 or said more clearly.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 There's going to come a day where he experiences and begins to experience insecurity.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 And he will not have just the confidence that I can go out, and I don't care what I look like

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 and what other people think and look at me and look how great this is.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 But insecurity is coming for him.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 And I know that because it came for me.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And it's come for everyone that I've ever met.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And at some point in their life, it's like we awaken to insecurity.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 We become very self-conscious, very concerned about what other people think about us,

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 very insecure about just different parts of our lives.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And when you think about the fact that every person in this room could quickly think of--

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 if I said, "Hey, if you could change one thing about your external appearance,

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 let's just start as shallow as that," one thing, all of us would quickly go, "I know what I'd change.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 I've got a list, but if I can only pick one, I know what I'd change."

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And as long as--really, I can remember insecurity has been a part of my life.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 So I don't know what insecurity looks like for you.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I just want to talk about battling insecurity.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Initially, I called the message that we're about to talk through, the cure for insecurity,

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 and then I was like, "I don't think that's honest.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 I don't know that there is a one-size-fits-all cure,

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 but there is a way that God lays out for us to battle insecurity."

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 What do I mean by insecurity? Get us all on the same page.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Here's what Webster's defines it and how I'm going to incorporate is,

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 "Hey, insecurity is uncertainty or anxiety about oneself, a lack of confidence."

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I don't know what insecurities have been a part of your story

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 or maybe a part of your past or a part of your present,

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 but think about the ways insecurity has shaped us.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Think about, like, maybe in middle school, you were late to the game to get braces

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 or you were early to the game to get braces or you had the bowl cut

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 or you had just, you know, parents who dressed you in a way that you're like,

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 "What were you thinking, Mom?"

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Maybe you were a late bloomer and you were insecure about the fact

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 that everyone had already gone through puberty and you were like,

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 "I'm in the 10th grade and I don't have armpit hair."

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Or maybe you were an early bloomer, which is not any better, right?

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 When you're like 6'4" and everyone else is still like 5'2"?

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Unless you're a guy, I guess, and then you're like, "Fee-fi-fo-fo."

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 But just think about how insecurity is something that, man, it plagues

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 and can plague all of us.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Today, insecurity about what you look like,

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 about the clothes that you have, the job that you have, the car that you drive,

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 how it can own your perspective in a moment and rob you of the ability

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 to be present with people because you're too concerned about what they think.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 In my own life, I think about how insecurity can have power over

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 and has had power over just my willingness to try things

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 because I'm afraid I would fail.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 I'm insecure.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 I mean, I remember distinctly even in college, we'd go out--

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 and I didn't grow up skiing on the water--

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 we'd go out and we'd go on a boat and we'd go ski.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And I remember at some point I tried skiing, couldn't do it,

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 and that marked me in a way where every time we got on a boat,

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 I'm like, "I'm good. I'll pass."

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 It was just an insecurity.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Insecurity I can resonate with in my own life of just ways

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 that I can be insecure over external appearance.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 You always hear a phrase, "Tall, dark, and handsome,"

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 and for my whole life, I've never heard "tall, extra Caucasian,

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 and strawberry-blind."

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 [laughter]

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 You're not supposed to laugh at that. That's offensive.

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 No, but--so I don't know what that looks like for you,

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 but I know that insecurity is something that has come

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 and comes for all of us.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And yet it will rob you if you and I allow it to.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 It will rob us from experiencing and really becoming

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 everything God wants you to become.

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 It may rob you of the future spouse you're supposed to have

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 because you're too insecure to not be in a dating relationship.

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 So your standards are not like, "Hey, are they biblical?"

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 and they kind of meet God's criteria. You're like, "Are they breathing?"

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 That's what I'm more concerned about. And so you go from one to the next and next,

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 and you forfeit seeing what God has for you because you're too insecure to be alone.

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 It may cause you to change jobs, to make life decisions,

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 to orient your life because you're like, "Man, I'm defined by this car,

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 so I have to stay in debt,"

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 or, "I'm concerned about what other people think about me."

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Just think about the power. And yet there is a freedom that God wants to have

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 in our life, or wants us to have, as it relates to insecurity.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And in that freedom, we are better able to experience

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 becoming the person God wants you to become,

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 experiencing a life full of purpose,

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 and a life, candidly, where you are comfortable in your own skin.

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 How tragic is it that that seems so far-fetched for so many people?

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And so what I want to cover from the book of Judges,

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 which is what we've been in as we explore this series, "Before There Were Kings,"

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 is the story of a guy, a guy named Gideon.

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 And in his story, there's some principles that I think are so profoundly helpful

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 as we battle insecurity. If you take notes, that's what tonight's message is.

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 It's battling insecurity. It's battling insecurity.

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 So we're going to be in the book of Judges, chapter 6,

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 and the series that we're in, "Before There Were Kings,"

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 it's basically looking at some of the characters in the book of Judges,

132
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 which is named after these different men.

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 A judge in that time was not like Judge Judy with a black gown and a gavel.

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 A judge at that time was a deliverer that God would raise up to save the people.

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 And so really, the book of Judges is like the X-Men, if you will.

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 It's like these different people that God--

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 you know, he kind of pulls out Samson, "You're super strong."

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 He pulls out Deborah, "You're going to be Ice Woman," or whatever.

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 He pulls out these different people, and God shows up to them,

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 not Professor Xavier.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 I hope people are following me on that. I just asked.

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 What's the name of the guy, the bald guy?

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 And--well, he shows up, and he basically says,

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 "Hey, you're going to come be on my team. You're going to be a part of the X-Men."

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 That's who the different judges are.

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And the judges would come and deliver the nation of Israel,

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 which is what the Old Testament's all about.

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Basically, the nation of Israel would do the same thing over and over and over

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 in the book of Judges.

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 And here's what they would do.

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 God would set them free.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 They would sin against God and worship false idols.

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 God would say, "You want foreign idols? I'm going to let you have foreign rulers."

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 They'd be conquered by foreign rulers.

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 They would cry out to God. That's called supplication.

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 I think we have a slide even of that.

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Basically, just where they cry out and be like, "God, we're sorry. Save us."

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And then God would send a deliverer.

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 He would send a judge to set them free.

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Tonight, we're going to meet the judge named Gideon.

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 But this was the cycle that goes on and on and on and on.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And because of that cycle, the words before--

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 or in those days, there was no king in Israel.

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Everyone did what was right in their own eyes.

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 It's setting up the fact that the nation would cry out for a king

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 because they would just keep going through this cycle, this sin cycle,

167
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 over and over and over again, crying out,

168
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 "Hey, we need a king, someone to come in and rule our lives."

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 So that's the series that we're going to be in.

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 We're going to pick it up in chapter 6.

171
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And really, 6 through 8, chapters 6 through 8 in the book of Judges

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 cover the life of Gideon.

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 And I'm just going to high-level go over the story

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 so you can, again, like we did a couple weeks ago,

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 kind of watch the movie with me.

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 And I'm just going to tell what happened.

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 But let me start in verse 1 of chapter 6,

178
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 at the story of Gideon.

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 "The Israelites," verse 1, "did evil in the Lord's sight.

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 So the Lord handed them over to the Midianites for seven years."

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 So the Midianites are the conquering power,

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 the villains, if you will, of the story that we're about to look at.

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 They come in, they conquer.

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And verse 6, "Israel was reduced to starvation by the Midianites,

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 so the Israelites cried out to the Lord."

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 So we're in that cycle. They sin. God gives them over.

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 They're conquered. They're like, "God, we're sorry. Save us."

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 And so here's--he sends his deliverer, Gideon.

189
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 "Then the angel of the Lord,"

190
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 which scholars have long pointed out is likely Jesus.

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 The angel of the Lord, the only term of that title

192
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 doesn't appear in all the New Testament.

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 It's consistently in places like this.

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 We're about to see that it would be--

195
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 the angel of the Lord would appear,

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 and people believe that it is the pre-Christmas Jesus,

197
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 that it is God himself showing up

198
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 before he came to this earth in his appearance,

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 which is why it doesn't show up inside all the New Testament.

200
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 So he shows up, not Professor Xavier,

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Jesus himself to call Gideon, and he does this.

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 "Gideon, the son of Joash, was threshing wheat

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 at the bottom of a winepress to hide grain from the Midianites."

204
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Threshing wheat at the bottom of a winepress.

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Who hasn't been there? Am I right?

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 What does that even mean? What is he doing?

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 He's threshing wheat, and I don't have all the time to get into it,

208
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 but basically the author's trying to point out,

209
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 like, this dude was scared, he's threshing wheat,

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 he basically wants to make a sandwich,

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 but he's not doing it out in the open,

212
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 he's doing it in the bottom of a winepress, which is like a pit.

213
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 He's afraid is the point that he's trying to make.

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 This guy that's going to be the hero at this point

215
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 is not courageous, but he's a coward.

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And the angel of the Lord says to him this.

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 "The angel of the Lord appeared and said,

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 'Mighty hero, the Lord is with you,'"

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 or "valiant hero," your translation may have.

220
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 What is that, valiant?

221
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 He's hiding, he's afraid, he's terrified,

222
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 he's at the bottom, he's basically in a pit

223
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 trying to make a sandwich.

224
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 What do you mean the angel of the Lord shows up and says,

225
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 "Hey, I see you as heroic, I don't see you as you.

226
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 See you.

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 I see all that you can be and will be."

228
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 He saw things in Gideon he didn't even see in himself,

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 and he says, "Hey, you're going to be the one,"

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 in the next verse, "to deliver my people."

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 And Gideon responds, and he says, verse 15,

232
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 "But Lord, how can I rescue Israel?

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 My clan is the weakest in the whole tribe of Manasseh,

234
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 and I'm the least in my entire family."

235
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 So hey, my squad is the weakest of all squads,

236
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 and I'm the weakest in my squad.

237
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 How can you use me to be the person

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 that you would set free, God?

239
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 There's a lot of other people

240
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 that would be better than me,

241
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 even in my own family, he says.

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 "But the Lord said to him, 'I will be with you,

243
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 and I will destroy the Midianites

244
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 as if you were fighting them against one man.'"

245
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 So Gideon's sitting there, and he's like,

246
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 "Man, you're going to have me fight this oppressive enemy?

247
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Okay, if that's true, I need to have a sign."

248
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 So he says this, "Gideon replied,

249
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 'If you're going to truly help me,

250
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 show me a sign to prove that it's really

251
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 the Lord speaking to me.

252
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Don't go away until I come back

253
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 and bring my offering to you.'

254
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And he answered, 'I'll stay here until you return.'"

255
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 So Gideon runs away, kind of gets an offering.

256
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 He's going to make a sacrifice to the Lord,

257
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 and he begins to build the altar.

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 It's all in front of the angel of the Lord,

259
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 and he's putting it together.

260
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 He's looking for his lighter to light this thing on fire.

261
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Angel of the Lord, we're told, does this.

262
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 "Then the angel of the Lord touched the meat and the bread

263
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 with the tip of his staff, and fire,

264
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 flamed up from the rock,

265
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 consumed all that he had brought,

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 and the angel of the Lord disappears."

267
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 So he's sitting there looking for a lighter,

268
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 and angel of the Lord just shoots fire onto this thing.

269
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Everything's gone.

270
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Gideon immediately kind of overreacts,

271
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 and he's like, "Oh my goodness, it really is the Lord.

272
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 I've seen the Lord. I'm going to die."

273
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 And the angel of the Lord basically goes,

274
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 "Hey, dude, it's chill.

275
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 I would have killed you already if I was going to kill you.

276
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Just keep calm."

277
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 And that's my own paraphrase,

278
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 but that's essentially what happens.

279
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 And Gideon goes, "Man, I guess the Lord is with me."

280
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 And he goes off to assemble an army

281
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 to go fight the Midianites.

282
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 And then a little bit of time goes by,

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 and he begins to wonder, like,

284
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 "Man, was I really sure that God was with me?

285
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Am I really confident that what I think he wants me to do

286
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 is what he wants me to do?

287
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 I need to get another sign."

288
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 That's the problem with signs.

289
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Like, they don't last.

290
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 So he's like, "I need another sign."

291
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 So he goes to God and says, "Hey," verse 36,

292
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 "If you're truly going to rescue Israel as you promised,

293
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 prove it to me in this way."

294
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 And he says, "Hey, I'm going to lay out a fleece.

295
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 And on the fleece, it'll be on the ground,

296
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 and when I wake up in the morning, God,

297
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 if the fleece is wet but everything around it is dry,

298
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 then I will know that you're with me,

299
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 and I will know."

300
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And so it's kind of a weird sign,

301
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 but he goes to bed, wakes up that morning,

302
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 the fleece is soaking wet, all the ground around it is dry.

303
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And then he begins to go, "Wait a second.

304
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 That could have just been like a weird rainstorm,

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 or I don't know what happened here.

306
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Somebody could have just poured water on it,

307
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 playing like a joke on me.

308
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 God, if it's really you, I'm going to set a fleece out,

309
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 and I need it to be completely dry,

310
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 have all the ground around it be soaking wet."

311
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Goes to bed, wakes up the next morning,

312
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 the ground is soaking wet, the fleece is dry,

313
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 and he's like, "Man, I guess this is what God

314
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 is calling me to do."

315
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 He begins to assemble his army.

316
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 He gets 32,000 people.

317
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 That's a lot of people.

318
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Here's the problem.

319
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 The army he was facing had 120,000 people.

320
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 I'm not, and have never been great at math,

321
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 but even I can see those are not great odds.

322
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Those are four to one.

323
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And one day God shows up, and he's like sitting there,

324
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 and he's like, "What are we going to do with 32,000?

325
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Hopefully these guys are good fighters."

326
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Looking at them, they're all starving, farmers.

327
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 So he's like, "Well, that's not, we can't bank on that.

328
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 We need another plan."

329
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 And he's sitting there, and he's beginning to think,

330
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 "What are we going to do?"

331
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And God shows up, and God says this.

332
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 "Gideon, you have too many warriors.

333
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 If I let all of you fight the Midianites,

334
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 the Israelites will boast to me that they saved themselves

335
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 by their own strength."

336
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 So he shows up, and you've got to be thinking,

337
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 I mean, how did that look?

338
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Sitting there, God shows up, and he's like,

339
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 "Hey, Gideon, you getting ready for war?

340
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 I've got to talk to you.

341
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 We've got a problem with the numbers."

342
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Gideon's like, "Yep, I'm glad you brought it up.

343
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 I wasn't going to say anything, but I feel like the same thing.

344
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 It's four to one over here."

345
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 And he's like, "I want you to shrink the army."

346
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And he's like, "Did I hear you?

347
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 You want me to shrink the army?

348
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 What do you mean shrink the army?"

349
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 He's like, "Anyone who's afraid, tell them that they can go home."

350
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 So Gideon, he gets the group together.

351
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 He's like, "What are you thinking at that point?"

352
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 You're like, "Afraid?

353
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Look, it's four to one."

354
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 "Hey, guys, God told me to give an announcement.

355
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 I know nobody here is going to respond to,

356
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 but if you're afraid"--I know none of us are, right?

357
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 "If you're afraid, you can leave.

358
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Most of the army leaves.

359
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 It's down to 10,000."

360
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 And God shows up again, and he says, "Gideon,

361
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 there's still too many," verse 4,

362
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 "Bring them down to the spring, and I will test them

363
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 to determine who will go with you and who will not."

364
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 So God introduces the very first drinking game ever.

365
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 There's no alcohol involved, and he says, "Hey,

366
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 I want them to go down to the spring,

367
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 and based on a certain way that they drink,

368
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 will be the factor that determines whether or not

369
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 they're going to be in this new squad and this new crew."

370
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 If I'm Gideon at this point, I'm like,

371
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 "I'm not sure I want to be a part of this plan."

372
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Shrink it again.

373
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 He does the drinking game.

374
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 They get down to 300 men, and God says, "Perfect."

375
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 It's the original 300, for any of my guy friends in the room.

376
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Verse 7, "With these 300 men," the Lord said,

377
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 "I will rescue you and give you victory

378
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 over the Midianites.

379
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Send everyone else or all the others home."

380
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 So Gideon goes from 4 to 1 odds to 12 to 1 odds

381
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 to 400 to 1 odds.

382
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 I mean, at this point, he has soiled himself multiple times.

383
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Think about it.

384
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 300 people compared.

385
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 They're battling against the whatever biggest football

386
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 stadium, college football stadium you've ever seen.

387
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 120,000, bigger than that.

388
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Verse 300.

389
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 He's sitting there going, "What are we going to do, God?"

390
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 He basically gets the instructions.

391
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 He goes, and at night, and here's the plan.

392
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 He divided the men into 300 men into three groups,

393
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 and he gave each man not a sword but a ram's horn,

394
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 which is essentially like old-school trumpet,

395
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 and a clay jar with a torch in it.

396
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 And he said, "Hey, on my command," he goes up to the

397
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 enemy's camp, and it says that he looks into the camp,

398
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 and as far as the eye can see, he sees camels.

399
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 The quote from the text is that the number of camels

400
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 outnumbered the number of sand on the seashore.

401
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 It's like as far as the eye can see, he sees people.

402
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 And yet he gets his 300 together, and he says,

403
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 "On my count, everyone blow the ram's horn, take your torch

404
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 "with the jar around it, and throw it and smash it

405
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 "on the ground."

406
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 And the men listen, and they do what they were told,

407
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 and here's what happened.

408
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 "When the 300 Israelites blew their ram's horn,

409
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 "the Lord caused the warriors in a camp to fight against

410
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 "each other with their swords.

411
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 "Those who were not killed fled to places as far away as

412
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 "Beth Shiddah and near Zerah and the border of," I'm not

413
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 even gonna try, "near Tabith."

414
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Then he basically shows up, they take the ram, they blow

415
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 the horn, they take their torch, they throw it on the ground.

416
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 All of a sudden, there's fire breaking out everywhere.

417
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 The Midianites begin to panic.

418
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 There's loud noise taking place everywhere, and it says

419
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 it's so dark outside, the Midianite camps and battalions

420
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 begin to fight one another, and they think that they're

421
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 being overtaken, and the ones that aren't killed by one

422
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 another end up just running off and fleeing.

423
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 And Gideon, through the Lord, through his plan,

424
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 delivered and rescued the people of Israel.

425
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Gideon's weakness was his strength.

426
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 They didn't lose a single person.

427
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 That had they brought the 32,000, even if they had won,

428
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 there was likely a good chance that there's gonna be some

429
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 serious casualties, even if those guys can each take on

430
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 four people, a person.

431
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 But with 300 men, God delivers and rescues the Midianites.

432
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Now, when I look at this story, there's so many different

433
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 things I don't wanna pull out, but there's just three as it

434
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 relates to insecurity that I think are profoundly helpful

435
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 principles, repeated all throughout the Bible, but three

436
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 that are definitely inside of these texts.

437
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 And so I just wanna give three takeaways as it relates to

438
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 fighting and battling insecurity, or winning the battle

439
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 of insecurity, and the first one is this, that you fight

440
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 insecurity with your God-given identity.

441
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 There's a lot of Christian-y words in there, so I want you

442
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 to hang with me, 'cause I think this is so huge.

443
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 You and I fight insecurity with your God-given identity.

444
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 The Lord shows up to Gideon, and he says, "Hey, let me tell

445
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 "you who you are."

446
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 In chapter 6, verse 12, "Let me tell you who you are.

447
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 "You are a mighty and valiant warrior.

448
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 "I don't see you like you see you.

449
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 "I don't see you like your family sees you.

450
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 "This is who you are."

451
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 And he sees and says something about Gideon.

452
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Gideon never would have even seen or said about himself,

453
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 "You are a mighty, valiant warrior, and I am with you."

454
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 And he speaks that over Gideon.

455
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 You know what is most true about you?

456
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Whatever God says about you.

457
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 What is most true about you are the things that God says

458
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 about you.

459
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Your God-given identity is your truest identity that there is.

460
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Now, here's where that matters, and so stay with me in case

461
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 you're like, "I don't know that I'm totally following."

462
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 The things that God says, "This is who you are," are the most

463
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 true labels you will ever wear in your life.

464
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 The labels that you wear of, "Hey, I'm too fat.

465
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 "I'm too ugly.

466
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 "I'm too small.

467
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 "I'm not smart enough.

468
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 "I'm not good enough.

469
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 "I don't have the right job.

470
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 "I'm not lovable.

471
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 "I'm dysfunctional in a dating relationship."

472
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 I'm--whatever the labels that you are, that you wear, or you have

473
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 worn in the past, they are lies when you compare them to the

474
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 truths that God says about you.

475
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 How do I know that?

476
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Because who can really give a label to someone and it actually

477
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 be a true label?

478
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Well, as I thought about it, there's a few groups.

479
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 There's someone--if you're the maker, the manufacturer of

480
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 something, like if Nike makes a shoe, they put a label on there.

481
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 If Adidas is like, "Hey, I'd like to put this on."

482
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 They can't put a label on there.

483
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Nike can't decide.

484
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 They're the maker.

485
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 They can decide what goes on there and what doesn't.

486
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 If you're the maker, you can put a label on something.

487
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 If you are the owner, you can put a label on something like,

488
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 "Hey, I can name my car," and I can be like, "You know what?

489
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 "My car's named Stallion."

490
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 If you came up and you're like, "We're going to name your car

491
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 "Pegasus," I'd be like, "That's weird.

492
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 "You're not the owner.

493
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 "You can't put a label on it."

494
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Or if you're the purchaser, if you purchase something, you can

495
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 put a label on it, you can name it.

496
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 I have a friend who recently--not long ago, they bought a dog that

497
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 was 12 years old, this bulldog.

498
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 And the bulldog had been named Sophie its entire life, and they

499
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 were like, "Yeah, it's now our dog, so we're going to call you

500
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 "Fran," not even in like in the same universe where it's like,

501
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 "Frofee, she'll still come to that.

502
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 "She's never once come to Fran.

503
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 "She still thinks her name is Sophie, but they're the owners,

504
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 "and they can say, 'This is your name.'"

505
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 You're the maker, you're the owner, you're the purchaser.

506
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 God is all three of those things.

507
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 He made you.

508
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 He tells us that your body is not your own.

509
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 You were bought with a price.

510
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 He purchased you, and everything that you have is on loan,

511
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 including you.

512
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 What God says about you is the thing that is most true about you.

513
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Whatever labels that you're going to wear, whatever labels you're

514
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 wearing right now, whatever labels you have worn, are at best

515
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 temporary, because you may be thinking, "Well, what about my

516
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 "job title?"

517
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Like that, you know, that's kind of true.

518
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 That is at best temporary.

519
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 You will likely not be X whatever forever, or you won't be forever

520
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 for all of eternity.

521
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 What God says about you is the things that are most true about you.

522
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 What are some of the things that God says, some labels that are

523
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 not lies?

524
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 You were loved.

525
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 You were created on purpose.

526
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 If you have trusted in Jesus, you are pure, righteous, holy.

527
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Everything in your past, everything in your present does not define

528
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 you the way that Christ does.

529
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 You have been forgiven.

530
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 You're a child of God.

531
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Those are the labels that are the things that are most true about you,

532
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 and you will fight insecurity.

533
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Like, man, hey, I can fight the fact that, man, I don't like the way

534
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 that I look.

535
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 I don't like how much that I make.

536
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 I don't like all the things that people think about me.

537
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 By saying, man, the one who matters most, this is what he thinks

538
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 about me.

539
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 The labels that are the truest, this is what they are about me.

540
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 And the God who's there would look at your life, and I wonder what he

541
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 would say.

542
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 I mean, think about it.

543
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Some of you just need to know there's a God who knows your name.

544
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 He knows your name.

545
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 He has plans for you.

546
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 He has purposes for you.

547
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Ephesians 2, verses 10 said that before the creation of the world,

548
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 he had good works planned for your life that he wanted you to experience

549
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 and be a part of.

550
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 In other words, God, before the world was created, had a to-do list with

551
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 your name, big things that he wanted to accomplish through you.

552
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 But if you and I will allow our insecurity to drive us away from

553
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 allowing the freedom that comes from focus, this is who your truest

554
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 identity is now and always and always will be.

555
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Or you can get caught up, like I can, in some of the lies, the labels

556
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 that can get put on you, labels like, "Man, you are what you make.

557
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 You are what other people think about you.

558
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 You are who you look or how you look.

559
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 You are the job that you have, the relationship status that you have."

560
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And they're lies.

561
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 They're labels that won't last because what is most true about you is what

562
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 God says about you.

563
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 It was for Gideon, and it is for you.

564
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Second takeaway that we see in just his story is this, that confidence

565
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 from anything temporary is temporary.

566
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 It's very simple on its face, but think about the things that Gideon was

567
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 looking for confidence in.

568
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Like he was looking at least for two.

569
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Two of the things that he looked for confidence, like, "Man, hey, this is

570
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 when I know I'm going to be confident.

571
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 This would make me feel a little bit more secure about myself."

572
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 There were two arenas.

573
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 One of them was signs.

574
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 But he looked to find confidence, "Man, if God's really going to work,

575
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 then, you know, I've got to have a sign."

576
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 And four different times were told in this story that he looked for a sign.

577
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 That's the problem with signs.

578
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 They don't last.

579
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 A little bit of time goes by, and you're like, "Man, was that really God

580
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 talking to me?

581
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 I mean, this is a free public service announcement."

582
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 This is like the problem, or I would be at least cautious for it because

583
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 working with young adults, there's a lot of times where people come down,

584
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 and you're like, "Man, you know what?

585
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 I wasn't sure if I would date her or I should date her."

586
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 And then I was in the car, I was driving, I was like, "God, if you want me

587
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 to date her, make the next four lights green."

588
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 And then I knew.

589
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 They were all four green.

590
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 I slowed down a little bit, but they were all four green.

591
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 And it's like, "Dude, you're thinking like a Looney Tune.

592
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 That's crazy."

593
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Anything that does not align with God's Word, you should be cautious about

594
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 whether or not, "Hey, and then God showed me because I was like,

595
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 if the lights are yellow or if, you know, I go outside and there's bird poop

596
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 on my car, I know it's you."

597
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 That's a random example.

598
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 I don't know where that came from.

599
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Anytime that someone says, "Hey, I just feel like, you know, God told me,"

600
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 and the next word's out of their mouth or anything that doesn't come from the

601
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Bible, you should be cautious.

602
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 "Hey, God told me."

603
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 How did he tell you?

604
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And maybe he did.

605
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 I'm not saying he didn't.

606
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 I'm just saying, "Hey, you should proceed with caution because there's a lot

607
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 of things that God has told you.

608
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 And if any of the things that God has told you don't align with God's Word

609
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 or counsel from kind of God's people around you, you should be concerned

610
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 and be cautious."

611
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 He looked for confidence in signs, and they didn't last.

612
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 He just needed one after the next and the next.

613
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Because anything, any confidence that you come from something temporary is

614
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 always going to be temporary.

615
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 The other arena that he looked for confidence was in comparison.

616
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 "Dude, this is convicting," or was for me.

617
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Here's what I mean.

618
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Here's why it was convicting.

619
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Like he looked around and he was like, "Hey, here's how I would feel more

620
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 confident, God.

621
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 If I was more impressive, if I was from a better family, if I didn't have kind

622
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 of this baggage in my past, if I was from a stronger tribe."

623
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Remember that in the verse where he said, "Hey, how can you use me?

624
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 I'm from the weakest clan and the weakest family, and you're going to use me?"

625
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 That built into his idea is that, "Man, if I was from something impressive,

626
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 if I was from a great family, a great family, if I was more physically

627
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 impressive, then, God, you could use me.

628
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Then I would be confident."

629
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 And confidence from comparison will never last.

630
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Think about the ways that our confidence is impacted, has been impacted,

631
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 is being impacted by comparison.

632
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Think about how much self-confidence we don't have, or maybe we do have

633
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 because of comparison.

634
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 I mean, we're constantly like, "We've made it easier than ever to compare our

635
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 lives to one another."

636
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Think about that.

637
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 And I wonder how that's robbing us of being comfortable with who we are,

638
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 focused on what God has around us, focused on doing God's will around us,

639
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 focused on loving people versus just seeking to make them love me.

640
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 What I mean by that is we made it easier than ever.

641
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 We have like apps.

642
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 One of the primary things that certain apps and social media even do is they kind

643
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 of give us our daily dose of discontentment, to quote a girl on our team.

644
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 They give us that chance of like comparison.

645
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 I can go on and compare to everyone else's life all over the place,

646
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 every friend that I have.

647
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 I compare to, "Hey, what they're doing."

648
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 I mean, think about like there used to be a day where when I went on,

649
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 when I had lunch today, I would just like look at my lunch and maybe people's

650
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 lunches around me.

651
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Now I go online and everyone is posting about what they're eating.

652
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Can we talk about this for a second?

653
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 This is weird.

654
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 When was it ever normal in all of human history to be like,

655
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 "I need to tell everyone I'm having a burrito, okay?

656
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Everyone everywhere needs to know where I am."

657
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 But it's just a part of who we are.

658
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 We compare everything.

659
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 I know what's going on in everybody's life.

660
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 I can look and be like, "Well, there's always somebody with a nicer car.

661
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 I can't believe they're on vacation again.

662
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Do they even have a job?"

663
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 It's just easy to compare and be so like, "Oh, man, man, I'm pathetic.

664
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 They always look amazing.

665
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Where are they even buying this stuff?"

666
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Now there's app notifications or there's notification.

667
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 I'm getting notifications from people sending me their workout information.

668
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 "Will you quit sending me your workout?"

669
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 On the Apple Watch, it's like, "Oh, yeah, they worked out today.

670
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Great."

671
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Is that a reminder?

672
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Ouch, okay?

673
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Get it.

674
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 I don't have time.

675
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 We got kids.

676
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Leave me alone.

677
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 It's just easier than ever is my point.

678
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 In the only way that I really can think of, and there's probably several other ones, so

679
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 don't email me.

680
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 This may be one of the few areas where we have it harder than older generations.

681
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Every other way that your grandparents would walk to snow, there was no shoes, the Great

682
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Depression, all that stuff, but they didn't have to deal, which is worse, much worse.

683
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Let's all acknowledge, much worse.

684
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 But they were not confronted with so many of the things that you're bombarded with every

685
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 single day.

686
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 And if you are not careful, you will do what we're all tempted to do every time, which

687
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 is compare our life, and based on how I stack up to the clan or the people in my family,

688
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 like Gideon, will determine how I stack up in life, who I am, how valuable I am, how

689
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 excited or how much joy I can have.

690
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 My mood will go up and down based on how I stack up.

691
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 I mean, we were talking about it today.

692
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 I think of, if my house, the only reason I want another house is because I see and compare

693
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 to other people around.

694
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 If my house was transplated to the East Congo, Africa, I'd be like, "Dude, I am living large

695
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 here."

696
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 But when you're surrounded and able to compare constantly, you're able to all of a sudden

697
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 be like, "Man, I got nothing.

698
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 I don't have enough.

699
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 I never have enough."

700
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 And if you are not careful, you will put your confidence in things that are temporary, and

701
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 it will always be a temporary dose of confidence that will not last.

702
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 You will draw from a well that will always leave you wanting, always leave you in need.

703
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 If you find your confidence in how you look, you will constantly be insecure.

704
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 No matter how pretty you are, some of the most beautiful people in our society are the

705
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 most insecure.

706
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 If you know anyone in the modeling agency, they will confirm that.

707
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 If you put your confidence in a dating relationship, you're going to move from one dysfunctional

708
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 relationship to the next and the next, because here's what's more important than you getting

709
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 healthy or dating someone who is healthy and holy.

710
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 What's more important is you having a relationship, because it's where you draw your security,

711
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 your confidence.

712
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 You don't know what it's like to not have someone around.

713
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 So you will never heal as a person.

714
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 You'll never get out of that dysfunctional relationship and heal by pursuing what God

715
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 wants for you.

716
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 You'll just go from one to the next to the next.

717
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 And you will always come up wanting, because anything, any confidence that comes from temporary

718
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 things will always be temporary.

719
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 If you look for it in money, if you look for it in number of followers on Instagram, you

720
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 will never have enough.

721
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 And the God who's there saying, I don't want you to look.

722
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 The goal of this message is not for you to have more self-confidence.

723
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 In other words, it's not like, hey, guys, you need to just be you and you look great

724
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 today and look in that mirror and be like, I'm a million bucks.

725
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 That's not the goal that will never last.

726
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 The goal is not for you to have self-confidence.

727
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 It's for you to find a source of confidence outside of yourself, for you to find a source

728
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 of confidence that comes from God and from God alone.

729
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 That he's the only well that will never run dry.

730
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 That is the goal.

731
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 In other words, it is not about how much confidence you have.

732
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 Is it about as is it is?

733
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Oh, my goodness.

734
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 As it is about.

735
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 What has you confident?

736
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 It's not about how much confidence you have.

737
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 It's about what has you confident?

738
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 Is it how you look?

739
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 Is it something temporary?

740
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Or is it the fact that there's a God who knows your name, who's moving the pieces, he's sovereign

741
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 over your life, he's in control of all things, he's working everything for your good, he

742
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 made you just as you are, he has a plan and a purpose for your life, you could trust him,

743
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 you can trust his way.

744
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 Is that where you find your confidence?

745
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Or is it in your car?

746
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Is it how much you make?

747
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 How much is in your bank account?

748
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Anything temporary will always be temporary and will always leave you wanting.

749
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 In my front yard, we have a natural spring underneath our house.

750
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 It's really bizarre.

751
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 And it leads to one interesting thing.

752
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 I may have the only yard on the block that like we're never gonna have a problem of the

753
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 grass being watered.

754
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 If anything, the problem is like too much.

755
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 There's constant water.

756
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 There's a spring of water underneath our house.

757
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 So it can constantly keep, it does constantly keep kind of our grass always watered, never thirsty.

758
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 The God who's there wants you to experience a life where you are never thirsty.

759
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 There's a constant spring.

760
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 You don't have to keep going back and forth and ebb and flow and how did my day go today

761
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 and how much money did I make today or what did they think about me today or what relationship

762
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 do I have today, but it's constant, it's fixed, because it doesn't come from self.

763
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 It comes from him.

764
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Have you ever met someone that has that type of confidence?

765
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 It's like startling, isn't it?

766
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Like they're like, they're comfortable in who they are.

767
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 They're like content.

768
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 They have this God confidence in it.

769
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 It like makes them like content.

770
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Like they have peace when things kind of go crazy.

771
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 They know who God made them and they're it's like they're okay with it.

772
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Because they found a source that is not leaving them wanting because they're not looking for

773
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 their confidence to come from something temporary.

774
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 If you are looking for your confidence to come from that, you will always be on the

775
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 roller coaster ride of emotions and never experience the security that God wants you

776
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 to experience.

777
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 It comes from knowing him, walking and trusting in him.

778
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Finally, the third idea just related to confidence and security is this.

779
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Confidence in God comes through obedience.

780
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 Confidence in God comes through obedience.

781
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 You will grow your confidence, your trust in God.

782
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 You'll grow your faith in God, said another way, by trusting and obeying.

783
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 Think about how Gideon's faith or his confidence in God grew in that moment.

784
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 He's going up and he's like, dude, we had 30,000.

785
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 God said take it down to 10.

786
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 I'm like, are you serious?

787
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 You want me to take it down to 10,000?

788
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Now we're down to 300 people.

789
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 He looks and he sees camels as far as the eye can see.

790
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 And in a moment, he's got a decision.

791
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 He walks to the line and says, I'm going to obey God.

792
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 And in doing so, he does.

793
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 And think about how his confidence, wow, God's word, his promises are true.

794
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 I can trust him.

795
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 Think about how that would have grown.

796
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 Think about how it would have not had he walked up to the line and been like, yeah,

797
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 I see camels.

798
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 We're out on this.

799
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Guys, let's all go home.

800
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 Let's try to get the other 30,000 back.

801
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 Think about what he would have forfeited and missed out on.

802
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 He wouldn't have seen God deliver his people.

803
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 He wouldn't have been a part of God's plan.

804
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 He wouldn't have seen all the ways, the incredible, miraculous, if you will, ways that God worked.

805
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Think about what he would have missed out on.

806
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 And here's what's so important for you, for young adults in the room.

807
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 We're about to be done.

808
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 Most of us don't ever step up to the line like Gideon did in that moment and say, man,

809
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 this is what God is asking me to do.

810
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 It seems crazy.

811
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 It seems countercultural.

812
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 It honestly seems like pretty big.

813
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 God, I'm not sure that I want to do that.

814
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 It seems a little foreign, a little too much.

815
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 Most of us walk up to the line and instead of saying, even though it's all those things, God, I'm willing, I'm going to obey you.

816
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 Most of us walk up to the line and we go, I'm not doing that.

817
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 I'm going home.

818
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 We walk up to the line and we go, God, you said you want me to save sex for marriage.

819
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 Are you kidding me?

820
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 That's so old fashioned.

821
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 That's so outdated.

822
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 That's too much to ask.

823
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 God, I'm not doing that.

824
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 You're saying that I have to like work a job or if I'm working a job that doesn't really allow me to be plugged into a church, to be using kind of my gifts, to make Jesus more famous, to be in a community group and to be have other believers in my life to encourage me.

825
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 You're saying that if I work a job and there's just too many hours that I'm working that prohibit or don't allow me to do those things that I should change jobs.

826
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 Yeah, I'm not doing that unless the other job has more money than I would do it.

827
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 But I'm not crossing that line.

828
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Most of us, we walk up to the line, we go, that's too big of a thing.

829
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 And we choose not to obey.

830
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 And we forfeit seeing all the ways that God is going to work.

831
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 Let me let me be really specific.

832
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 When you walk up to the line and you say, God, this is how you're telling me I should date.

833
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 That seems so crazy to me.

834
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 I can't do that.

835
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 God, nobody does that like that.

836
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 All the good Christian guys or Christian girls are taken.

837
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 I just it doesn't work that way.

838
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 God, I'm going to do it my own.

839
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 You do it your own.

840
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 And you will forfeit seeing what God could have done, what God would have done.

841
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 And you will end up with that guy on Tinder that you met.

842
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 And you'll have that relationship kind of string along.

843
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 And you'll break up a couple times, get back together and manichaeism, manic close.

844
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 And that's the future that you have in store.

845
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 And you will forfeit seeing what God could have done, what God wanted to do.

846
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 If you're the person who says, like, look, I'm 32.

847
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 I'm running out of options here, God.

848
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 And so, yes, he's not exactly all in with Jesus.

849
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 But he comes to church with me.

850
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 And that feels like a plus.

851
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 So I'm going to date him even though your word says I shouldn't.

852
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 That I shouldn't be unequally yoked.

853
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 That people in my life who are Christians are saying, hey, I don't think that guy is good for you.

854
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Even though all those things are true.

855
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 I'm going to date him, God, because I don't have that many options.

856
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 My biological clock is ticking.

857
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 And I am not going to -- you're saying that, man, if I follow God, I may end up single.

858
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 Too big.

859
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 Outtie.

860
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 It's what most of us do.

861
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 And you forfeit seeing how God would have worked, could have worked, wanted to work, all that he would have done in your life.

862
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 Just like Gideon, had he walked away from the line, he would have forfeited seeing everything God was about to do for him.

863
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 And the God who's there is saying, I love you.

864
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 I'm crazy about you.

865
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 My way is better.

866
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 Will you trust me?

867
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 Are you going to keep trusting in yourself in your own ways?

868
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 And if you do, your confidence in me will not grow.

869
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 Because the only way it grows is through obedience to me.

870
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 And whenever you take that step and you trust me, you begin to go, wow, that actually worked.

871
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 God's way really is better.

872
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 There's no one out there -- I've never met and heard the story.

873
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 I've been doing this for ten years.

874
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 I've never heard the person be like, look, hey, you know, this is my wife.

875
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 We ended up together.

876
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 This has been great.

877
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 You know, the one regret I have is I didn't have enough casual sex in my 20s.

878
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 That's the one thing I feel like I left on the field.

879
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 I've never heard it.

880
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 I've never heard the person who said I went all in with Jesus.

881
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 Now, I don't mean somebody who is just anybody.

882
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 I mean somebody who stands before you and goes, man, my life is filled with purpose and joy.

883
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 I'm following Jesus.

884
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 I'm all in.

885
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 That couple, you never hear them say that.

886
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 I've never heard the person who said, man, I went all in with Jesus and just everything, it was terrible.

887
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 Not that it wasn't hard.

888
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 Not that there wasn't challenges that came in life.

889
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 But they began to experience purpose and peace, contentment, even confidence, comfortable in their own skin.

890
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 And that's what the God who's there, he wants you to experience.

891
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 He wants you to put your confidence in him, but your confidence in him will only grow through obedience.

892
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 And every day you have the choice.

893
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 Am I going to choose to grow that confidence by being obedient or not and forfeit what God could have done, would have done?

894
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 I think most of us, it's really easy, especially in Dallas, to say, man, God, I trust you with our words and not with our actions.

895
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 I'm not actually going to follow it up.

896
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 I say I believe you, but I'm not actually going to act on those things that I say I believe.

897
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 There's a guy in the 1860s, and I'll close here, and his name was Blondine.

898
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 He was a famous tightroper in France, and then he came over to America, and this dude did mind-blowing feats.

899
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 He particularly was well-known and famous for being the first person to ever tightrope Niagara Falls.

900
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 It was over a quarter mile across, 160 feet up in the air, and he tightroped across.

901
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 There he is. There's a newspaper thing from him tightroping across Niagara Falls, 1860s.

902
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 And he got so good at this that crowds would come out and they'd see him, and they'd see him walk across on the tightrope across Niagara Falls.

903
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 I mean, that's certain death if you fall.

904
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 He got so good that at one point he decided, hey, I'm going to do this blindfolded.

905
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 He walked across blindfolded.

906
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 He's another great Blondine.

907
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 Then he was like, I need another challenge.

908
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 He took stilts out, and he got stilts on.

909
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 He walked across on stilts, the tightrope.

910
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 At one point he got midway through, he decided, here's my next feat.

911
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 He goes to the middle of the tightrope, walks halfway through.

912
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 He brought a cooker and a skillet with him.

913
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 He cooked an omelet, and he ate the omelet, and then walked across.

914
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 This dude was like unreal, and crowds would show up to see him.

915
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 And at one point he decided to get out a wheelbarrow.

916
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 He got the wheelbarrow.

917
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 He began filling it with these bags of potatoes, potato sacks.

918
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 And he walked the wheelbarrow, and he took this full wheelbarrow full of potato sacks, and he walked across Niagara Falls.

919
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 And then he walked back, and the crowd's going crazy.

920
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 And they're like, man, you're the great Blondine.

921
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 Unbelievable.

922
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 And he looked into the crowd, and he says, who thinks I could take a person across the tightrope with me?

923
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 And the crowd, they're like, we believe in you.

924
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 You're the great Blondine.

925
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 You could do it.

926
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 And he's like, who's willing to get in the wheelbarrow?

927
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 Silence.

928
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 Except for one person who stepped forward.

929
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 And he got in the wheelbarrow, and he walked across, and he made it.

930
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 There's a sharp difference between the person in the crowd who says, man, I believe, and the person who's willing to step out, get into the wheelbarrow, and say, I believe.

931
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 And I'm willing to act on it.

932
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 Inside of the room, there are many of you who are claiming to be Christians.

933
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 I would say hundreds, if not thousands, and yet your actions don't align with the words that you're saying.

934
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 You are not choosing to date in line with God's will.

935
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 You're not choosing to handle your life, your money, your time.

936
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 And you would say, and you'd hide behind the fact that, hey, you're a good person.

937
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 And maybe by the world standards, you are a good person.

938
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 That probably adds to even the problem, because you're like, yeah, you know, it's not that big of a deal.

939
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 Of course we're going to live together.

940
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 That's just kind of what you do in this life stage.

941
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 Of course we're going to date this way.

942
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 It's just what you do.

943
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 Of course I'm going to live this life and work this job.

944
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 And you claim that, hey, Jesus is who he says he is.

945
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 He's sovereign.

946
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 He's in control.

947
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 He's the one that leads life.

948
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 His way is good, and everyone should follow him.

949
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 And yet you're not.

950
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 And you're sitting in the crowd saying, we believe.

951
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 But you're not willing to act on it.

952
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 And you are forfeiting seeing what God will do, can do, and will do in your life.

953
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 If you will trust him, you'll forfeit being a part of moving across Niagara Falls with your life in ways that you never could have even imagined.

954
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 Moving towards the marriage, the future, the man or the woman that God has for you, intends for you to be, that finds their security and strength in him.

955
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 I trust him.

956
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 Others of you, as it relates to this idea of trust, you have never had a moment where you trusted that Jesus paid for your sin on the cross.

957
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 He paid for everything you've ever done.

958
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 He's the only way that you can have eternal life.

959
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 That you've been given a free gift if you'll just accept it by God.

960
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 And I'm putting all of my hopes, all of my trust, everything that I have.

961
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 If I'm going to have eternal life, if I'm going to heaven when I die, it will only be because Jesus died in my place.

962
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 He rose from the dead to show the payment cleared.

963
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 And he was more than enough.

964
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 And I'm putting my trust, not in how good of a person I am, but in him.

965
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 In him alone. I'm getting in the wheelbarrow.

966
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 I can't do it alone.

967
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 And I'm putting all of my trust in him.

968
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 And the reason I know that you've never had that moment is when you're asked questions like, "Man, what do you think is going to happen?"

969
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 Or, "Do you think that you'll have eternal life?"

970
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 Or, "Do you think that you would spend eternity in heaven if something happened?"

971
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 Lord willing, you say, "You know, I don't know. I just feel like I'm still working on my faith.

972
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 I've done some bad things. I'm just trying to get my life right."

973
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 And you are trusting in yourself.

974
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 Do you see that?

975
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 If you're someone who says, "Hey, God should accept me because I'm a pretty good person."

976
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 You're trusting in yourself.

977
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 You're not trusting in the only way to have eternal life, the only way to experience on this earth the abundant life.

978
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 You're trusting in yourself.

979
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 Whether you think you're good enough to have a relationship with God, or honestly more prevalent,

980
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 those who think you're too bad for him to right now in this moment, in this seat that you're sitting in, accept you,

981
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 based on nothing you will ever do, you will not ever be able to earn your way to heaven.

982
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 No matter how long you go without looking at pornography, or without taking a hit,

983
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 without getting drunk,

984
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 you will never ever get there.

985
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 No matter how many church services that you attend to get over that mistake that you made,

986
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 some abuse you were part of, an abortion in your past, you will never get rid of it.

987
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 The gap is too great, and you are trusting in yourself.

988
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 And the God who's there says, "Man, I will carry you. I'm the only chance you got.

989
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 Will you trust in me?

990
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 I died in your place."

991
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 It's not good people in heaven and bad people in hell.

992
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 It's forgiven people who go to heaven.

993
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 There's only one way to get forgiveness.

994
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 Accepting it.

995
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 Accepting Jesus died in your place.

996
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 He died the death you deserved.

997
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 He lived a life that was impossible you never could have lived.

998
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 As a free gift to make you the righteousness of God, that's what this Bible says.

999
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 That he took your place.

1000
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 And you can keep being like, "Man, I just need to get some things straight if I'm going to have that type of certainty."

1001
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 No, you don't.

1002
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 You need to trust in him.

1003
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 Let me pray.

1004
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 Father, thank you that you made him a nunosyn to become sin.

1005
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 Jesus, to become like sin.

1006
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 So that in him, for anyone who accepts him,

1007
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 accept him as Lord and Savior.

1008
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 Savior of them.

1009
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 They would become the very righteousness of God.

1010
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 The label that is most true about them is that everything in their past, their present, and their future paid for.

1011
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 And nothing they face, nothing they've done, nothing they will do can take that away.

1012
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 I pray tonight, God, you would break the veils that I can't break, that no words could break, no songs could break.

1013
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 And you would allow people to, for the very first time, believe that.

1014
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 And for the rest of their life, they would walk in that truth and trust.

1015
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 Not just in our words, but in our actions, God.

1016
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 Would you make us a people whose confidence in you is great because our obedience to you is great, and we see his way is better.

1017
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 And it leads to life.

1018
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 And we wouldn't forfeit, God, I just pray right now, specifically for friends in the room,

1019
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 and I don't know how many this represents, but who are in really dysfunctional relationships right now.

1020
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 And they're afraid to break up.

1021
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 But others around them, candidly, your word has said, like, this is not a healthy relationship.

1022
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 It would call them to do that.

1023
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 But they're afraid that you would move them to act, God.

1024
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 And they wouldn't forfeit what you have for them.

1025
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 They wouldn't forfeit what could be for them.

1026
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 So in that way, and a thousand other ways, that when we choose to go our own way, we forfeit seeing you move, God,

1027
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 would you help us, strengthen us.

1028
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 Thank you that you're a God who's defeated far more than an army of 120,000,

1029
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 but all sin everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, with everyone has been paid for.

1030
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 We worship you in song. Amen.

1031
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
