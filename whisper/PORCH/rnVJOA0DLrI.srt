1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:28,640
 - Well, welcome to the porch.

3
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,560
 My name is Josiah.

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,000
 I haven't met you, I hope to meet you at some point.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,720
 Man, it is good to be back.

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,320
 Let's go, Porch Live.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,560
 Porch Live Cincinnati, if you're tuning in,

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,960
 which I know you are.

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,720
 Porch Live Scottsdale, Houston, Austin, El Paso,

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,000
 man, Indianapolis, and a host of other locations

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,460
 jumping on with us tonight.

12
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,360
 Welcome.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,680
 We've been in a series titled Fortune Telling.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,000
 Words from the past that tell about our future.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,920
 And over the last few weeks,

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,560
 we've been answering questions,

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,200
 pretty important questions.

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,080
 Questions like, will I ever truly be forgiven?

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,040
 Will I be alone forever?

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,080
 Some of that's all too true for some of you tonight.

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,800
 That was for me too.

22
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,000
 31 is when I got married, so there's hope.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,920
 Will I go to heaven when I die?

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,800
 Like that was a question we answered.

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,720
 And then last week, JP came up here and he said,

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,240
 "Hey, who am I going to marry?"

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,720
 I mean, if you weren't here last week,

28
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,080
 you gotta check that out.

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,560
 Tonight, we're pulling up to the last week of the series.

30
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,800
 And we're going to answer the question,

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,400
 what is my purpose?

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
 What is my purpose?

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 And so let me start out by asking a question.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,640
 Y'all ever feel out of place?

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,520
 Anyone, anyone ever feel out of place in life?

36
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,360
 Yeah, a few of you.

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,880
 Okay, about 10, that's good.

38
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,600
 But seriously, we don't know each other very well.

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,260
 So I'm gonna let you in on my life.

40
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,520
 I grew up homeschooled.

41
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,360
 Thanks, mom.

42
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,180
 Appreciate that.

43
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,120
 Oh, we got some homeschoolers in the house, okay.

44
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,320
 (audience cheering)

45
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,680
 But listen, y'all, come on,

46
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,800
 let's just be honest, I'm a homeschoolers, man.

47
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,520
 Like, listen, I was awkward.

48
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,880
 Like, it was bad.

49
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,160
 And then I made that transition into public school

50
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,620
 my middle school years.

51
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,960
 And man, I had girls like handing me notes in the hallway,

52
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,600
 I guess because they liked my puka shell necklace

53
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,720
 or frosted tips.

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,380
 I think we got a picture of it on the screen.

55
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,920
 There we go, oh my gosh.

56
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,000
 (audience cheering)

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
 Hey, haters are gonna hate.

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,960
 (laughing)

59
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,200
 Haters are gonna hate.

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,680
 JD said, "Man, you just look like a wannabe

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,040
 "on One Tree Hill."

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,560
 And I'm like, "Come on, JD.

63
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,120
 "Man, that ain't right."

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,920
 But listen, man, they would give me these notes

65
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,760
 in the hallway and I'm like,

66
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,160
 "What do I even do with these things?

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,560
 "The only girls I ever went to school with

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,400
 "were my sisters."

69
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
 You know, like, that's weird if they would write me notes.

70
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,520
 I mean, no.

71
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,440
 And so, listen, that was true for me.

72
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,940
 I just kinda felt out of place.

73
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,780
 I'm like, "I don't think I'm supposed to be here."

74
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,040
 And so tonight, that was me.

75
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,200
 What about you?

76
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,480
 You ever felt out of place?

77
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,560
 Like, maybe it was going to your girlfriend's house

78
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,000
 over the holidays, meeting the parents,

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,840
 you know, that one thing,

80
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,720
 and you had her brother sizing you up.

81
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,560
 That was me.

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,160
 I've got some stories.

83
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,240
 Maybe you guys, y'all going to yoga for the first time

84
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,440
 with your girlfriend 'cause you're just trying

85
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,280
 to impress her.

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,160
 And let's just be honest, like, that's just,

87
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,680
 there's nothing comfortable about that, okay?

88
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,640
 But you're doing your thing.

89
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,560
 Or maybe some of you, you come into the church,

90
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,120
 you're smelling like smoke or smelling like alcohol,

91
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,800
 and you're just like, "Man, I just feel out of place

92
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,640
 "in this thing."

93
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,680
 And ladies, like, "Is my hair okay?

94
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,560
 "Are my clothes churchy enough?"

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,660
 You know?

96
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,520
 And you just kinda feel out of place.

97
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,600
 Or maybe you come into this place and someone says,

98
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,880
 "Hey, you wanna go to the porch tonight?"

99
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,440
 You're like, "Yeah."

100
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,600
 But you thought the porch was that restaurant

101
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,480
 and bar in Uptown, and then they brought you here,

102
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,760
 and you find yourself, and you're like,

103
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,560
 "Man, they're raising their hands.

104
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,520
 "They're singing these songs.

105
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,080
 "And they're just, man, they're opening their Bibles.

106
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,840
 "Like, I see the girls taking notes.

107
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,800
 "Like, get them a notebook."

108
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,280
 And I'm like, "This is awkward.

109
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,320
 "This is not my place.

110
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,680
 "This is not my crowd."

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,720
 And so, listen, listen.

112
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,760
 I start there tonight because this is what I know.

113
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,640
 If you don't know your purpose,

114
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,880
 then you will inevitably feel out of place.

115
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,320
 Like, do you catch that?

116
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,100
 Like, if you don't know your purpose,

117
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,680
 then you will inevitably feel out of place.

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,360
 And tonight, man, many of us,

119
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,360
 we're driving through this thing called life.

120
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,440
 We're chasing this job, this salary, this girl, this guy,

121
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,560
 this drug, this club.

122
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,720
 And listen, we think it's gonna give us purpose,

123
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,000
 but it only leaves us feeling empty.

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,520
 And we chase after these things

125
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,960
 that we think are gonna give us purpose,

126
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,040
 and then we just change.

127
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,760
 Like, "Oh, that didn't really give me purpose,

128
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,200
 "so let me just change the pursuit,"

129
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,360
 thinking that that's gonna help.

130
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,960
 And you find yourself in this kind of this

131
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,040
 treadmill of stupidity, no offense,

132
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,440
 just trying to keep it real.

133
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,300
 See, I believe the greatest tragedy

134
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,920
 is a person living their life

135
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,200
 and missing out on their purpose,

136
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,740
 never stopping once to ask God,

137
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,120
 "Why am I created?

138
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,340
 "Like, what's my purpose?

139
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,220
 "Why am I here?"

140
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,460
 And so, man, to stand before God and for Him to say,

141
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,600
 "Hey, yeah, you did all these things,

142
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,200
 "but you missed out on the one thing

143
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,300
 "that was gonna give you purpose in all of these things.

144
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,680
 "You wasted them."

145
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,620
 This is why in the book of Ecclesiastes,

146
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,520
 the book of wisdom, as many call it,

147
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,500
 it says that He, God, has planted eternity

148
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,240
 on the hearts of every man and every woman.

149
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,940
 Ecclesiastes 3.11, He has planted eternity

150
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,680
 in the heart of every human.

151
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,060
 And you know this to be true,

152
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,960
 like deep down, we know this.

153
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,580
 Like, we go to bed at night and we ask,

154
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,120
 "Hey, what is my purpose?"

155
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,720
 There's got to be something more.

156
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,000
 Some of you, man, you've achieved your goals

157
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,460
 or you achieved some of them, and you're like, "That's it?"

158
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,860
 You're like Tom Brady, man.

159
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,900
 Tom Brady did an interview with 60 Minutes

160
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,640
 in 2005 after he won his third Super Bowl.

161
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,520
 And he literally says, quote, this is what he says.

162
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,400
 He says, "Man, why do I have three Super Bowl rings

163
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,160
 "and still believe that there's something greater

164
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
 "out there for me?"

165
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,480
 Yeah, there's got to be something more.

166
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,280
 And this is what I would say,

167
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,520
 hey, Tom, if you're watching, which I don't think you are,

168
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,720
 there is.

169
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,360
 There's more.

170
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,480
 Why are you here?

171
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,200
 What is your purpose in life?

172
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,240
 And tonight I want to answer that.

173
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,080
 You ready for this?

174
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,900
 Like, it's real simple.

175
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,040
 I know you're gonna be like, "Oh, that's churchy."

176
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,240
 But it couldn't be any more true.

177
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,080
 Your purpose in life, my purpose in life,

178
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,480
 is to know Jesus and to make him known.

179
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,800
 Like, that's it.

180
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,920
 That's where we're headed tonight,

181
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,080
 to know Jesus and to make him known.

182
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,120
 And there's a God who's the author of life,

183
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,300
 and he has these purposes for your life,

184
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,720
 and he loves you too much to let you pursue

185
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,540
 any other purpose in which you were made.

186
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,540
 This is why your heart is beating tonight.

187
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,340
 This is why you have oxygen in your lungs.

188
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,860
 This is why you showed up at the porch tonight.

189
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:21,220
 March, I think it's the ninth, 2021.

190
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,220
 So that you would intersect with this message

191
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,580
 and it would change your life forever.

192
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,220
 But you know who needs this message more than anyone?

193
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,660
 It's me.

194
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,940
 Because I forget it.

195
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,380
 I forget this message.

196
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,740
 And so tonight we're gonna be in Philippians chapter three.

197
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,900
 Philippians is towards the end of your Bible.

198
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,840
 It's Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans,

199
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,740
 first and second Corinthians, Galatians,

200
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,900
 and then you'll pull up to Philippians.

201
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,660
 And we're gonna look at a guy named Paul,

202
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,060
 who found his purpose in his resume,

203
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,420
 until he met Christ.

204
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,700
 We're gonna be in Philippians three,

205
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,500
 starting in verse three, here we go.

206
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:03,820
 "We put no confidence in human effort,

207
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,380
 "though I could have confidence in my own effort

208
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,020
 "if anyone could."

209
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,380
 That's, like, and then he goes on and says,

210
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,860
 "Indeed, if others have reason for confidence

211
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,700
 "in their own efforts, I have even more."

212
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,000
 It sounds a little arrogant, just being honest.

213
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,700
 Then Paul goes through his resume.

214
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,760
 "I was circumcised on the eighth day.

215
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,460
 "I'm a pure-blooded citizen of Israel,

216
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,000
 "a member of the tribe of Benjamin,

217
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,480
 "a real Hebrew, if there ever was one.

218
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,920
 "I'm a member of the Pharisees

219
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,580
 "who demanded the strictest obedience to the Jewish law.

220
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,540
 "I was zealous that I harshly persecuted the church.

221
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,400
 "As for righteousness, man,

222
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,940
 "I obeyed the law without fault."

223
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,260
 Man, I'm faultless.

224
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,660
 Here's what that means, because we look at that

225
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,300
 and we're like, man, that's kind of weird language,

226
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,060
 but let me modernize it for you.

227
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,340
 Because we read this and we're like,

228
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,740
 what does this even mean?

229
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,500
 He says, hey, talk about family.

230
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,720
 I was born to the noble parents.

231
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,100
 They got connections everywhere.

232
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,280
 You talk about education, Baylor, A&M,

233
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,060
 no, no, no, no, Ivy League, yeah, whoop, whatever.

234
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,020
 Ivy League.

235
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,780
 No, no, no, Ivy League

236
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,980
 with honors.

237
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,420
 You want to talk about power?

238
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,180
 Man, I have authority over my enemies.

239
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,020
 I can persecute them.

240
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,920
 You want to talk about religion?

241
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,140
 I've never missed a Sunday.

242
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,660
 I know more Bible than you have forgotten.

243
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,700
 You want to talk about money?

244
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,800
 You want to talk about status?

245
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,100
 You want to talk about stuff?

246
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,920
 I win.

247
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,940
 You want to talk about respect?

248
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,100
 Man, I got older guys calling me.

249
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,400
 He begins to list out his resume.

250
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,620
 Let me ask you, what are you holding on to

251
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,780
 to give you purpose?

252
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,900
 Like, what did you come into this place with?

253
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,780
 What are you holding on to to give you purpose?

254
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,180
 That college athlete, the guy or girl you're dating,

255
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,220
 that six-figure job, your corner office, the promotion,

256
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,980
 your body, your good looks,

257
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,980
 like you're hanging on to those things?

258
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,540
 Your Instagram followers,

259
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,480
 what are you holding on to to give you purpose tonight?

260
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,380
 Then he turns everything that he just said

261
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,180
 about his resume on its head

262
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:18,020
 when it comes to finding our purpose.

263
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,820
 Verse seven, I once thought these things were valuable,

264
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,420
 like that word circled valuable right there,

265
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,760
 but now I consider them, what, worthless

266
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,700
 because of what Christ has done.

267
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,580
 Verse eight, yes, everything else is worthless

268
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,580
 when compared with the infinite value

269
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,500
 of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.

270
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,740
 There it is.

271
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,380
 For his sake, I have discarded everything else,

272
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,740
 counting it as garbage.

273
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,340
 This Greek word for garbage is skrupula.

274
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,100
 It's where we get the word crap,

275
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,140
 like just being honest, a four-letter word, crap.

276
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,740
 Like he's saying everything else is trash

277
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,660
 compared to the infinite value of knowing Jesus.

278
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,080
 All the stuff that Paul gained in his life, garbage,

279
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,420
 compared to knowing Christ.

280
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,660
 So what's your purpose?

281
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,220
 Know Jesus.

282
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,800
 Point number one, know Jesus.

283
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,500
 But where should I work, Josiah?

284
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,140
 Should I take this job or that job?

285
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,260
 I don't know.

286
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,140
 Which one's gonna help you know Jesus

287
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,740
 and make him known the most?

288
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,820
 Like some of you, you're pursuing the job that you have

289
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,940
 because you're so caught up with the salary,

290
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,660
 and listen, you're miserable.

291
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,660
 In the purpose, but your end is that salary.

292
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,700
 And we know that money isn't going to buy happiness.

293
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,820
 It's not gonna buy purpose.

294
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,420
 You know that to be the fact.

295
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,960
 You know that to be the truth.

296
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,960
 Just look at Hollywood, man.

297
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,420
 It's the most miserable place in the world.

298
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,700
 Am I gonna get married or stay single?

299
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,300
 I don't know, listen to JP's message last week.

300
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,000
 You'll probably know.

301
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,260
 Just being honest.

302
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,180
 No, no, no, you should honor him.

303
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,300
 Like you can be married and miss out on your purpose,

304
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,180
 or you can be single and miss out on your purpose,

305
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,900
 but married or single, if you live to know Jesus

306
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,740
 and make him known,

307
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,180
 you're not gonna live a life without purpose.

308
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,140
 Man, that's a promise, money back guaranteed.

309
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,900
 Like nobody's gonna get to heaven, I promise you this.

310
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,100
 Nobody's gonna get to heaven and be like,

311
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,340
 God, what's up with that, man?

312
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,580
 I was single down here.

313
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,420
 Like you couldn't even have a guy ask me out.

314
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,260
 Like what's up with that?

315
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,700
 Like do you not care?

316
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,460
 Like in a million years,

317
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,620
 no one's gonna get to heaven and say that.

318
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:39,440
 Streets of gold, but I couldn't even have a family.

319
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:46,540
 No one's gonna walk up to you and be like,

320
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,720
 single Susan, like you never got married?

321
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,600
 Single Steve, what's up, man?

322
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,860
 Like no one's gonna do that.

323
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,480
 Sometimes the English language falls short

324
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,960
 to define words in its entirety.

325
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,420
 Like the word no here in Philippians chapter three,

326
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,980
 this word no in the Greek,

327
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,360
 it's described in three ways.

328
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,540
 This word no.

329
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,240
 Doxa is one way.

330
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,600
 Doxa is to know something through the grapevine.

331
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,000
 It's like hearsay.

332
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,240
 And Paul's not saying, hey, I wanna doxa Jesus.

333
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,380
 I just wanna know about Jesus through the grapevine,

334
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,200
 through someone else's experience.

335
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,400
 Number two, episteme, episteme.

336
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,840
 This is where you know something through book knowledge.

337
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,560
 Like you just, you read your Bible and you have a few facts

338
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,680
 or you go to seminary and you get filled with some knowledge

339
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,520
 or you read some Christian books

340
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,760
 and you have those facts about Jesus.

341
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,880
 Paul doesn't use that word here.

342
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,080
 Paul uses the Greek word gnosis.

343
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,340
 Gnosis, it means like you know through experience.

344
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,240
 You don't know how something,

345
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,320
 you don't know how good something tastes

346
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,720
 unless it sinks into your teeth, right?

347
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,160
 Like the first time I had steak, like amazing.

348
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,680
 Like I'm not talking about steak from Longhorn, man, no.

349
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,000
 Or whatever, Ruth Chris.

350
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,680
 You're like, it's Longhorn, I don't do that.

351
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,800
 This is Dallas.

352
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,360
 No, hey, no, no, listen, listen.

353
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,920
 The first time I had steak,

354
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,200
 my brother-in-law's a farmer, he raises cows.

355
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,440
 Like he sent me an entire cow.

356
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,600
 Like that was an experience, y'all.

357
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,460
 Like a party going on in your mouth, right?

358
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,480
 No, this is what Paul is saying here.

359
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,180
 Like I wanna know Christ through experience.

360
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,080
 The purpose of my life is to know Christ

361
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
 in a way where I've experienced.

362
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,080
 I've tasted God, I've tasted Christ, and he's good, y'all.

363
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,000
 Let me ask you, do you know Jesus?

364
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,400
 Like not doxa, not, I know Jesus through people,

365
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
 I'm kinda hearsay, not episteme

366
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,920
 where you know about some books

367
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,040
 or you read tweets from a friend

368
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,800
 that loves Jesus really, really well

369
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,580
 and it kinda inspires you for the day.

370
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,460
 But do you know Jesus?

371
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,240
 Gnosis, where you've experienced him.

372
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,160
 Like your life's been changed

373
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,480
 because you've experienced him for yourself

374
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,760
 in a way that your life has been changed

375
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,380
 and people, man, listen, they see it, it's tangible.

376
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,180
 Let me just be honest with you tonight.

377
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,960
 If you don't know Jesus, man, you're gonna spend your life

378
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,400
 on the endless treadmill pursuing highs and lows,

379
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,320
 get to 85, and then you're gonna end up in the dirt.

380
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,140
 That's the outcome.

381
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,440
 That's what Paul's saying tonight.

382
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,260
 More importantly, it's what the God of the universe,

383
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,060
 the God of the galaxies, sovereign over everything

384
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,380
 is saying to you and I tonight.

385
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,460
 Paul continues in verse nine.

386
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,820
 He says, "I no longer count on my own righteousness

387
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,300
 "through obeying the law.

388
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,180
 "Rather, I become righteous through faith in Christ.

389
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,460
 "For God's way of making us right with himself

390
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,940
 "depends on faith."

391
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,340
 Another question I have for you tonight is

392
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,640
 have you received the righteousness that comes from God

393
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,620
 based on faith?

394
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,520
 Not based on your good works.

395
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,340
 This past weekend, we got a new furnace.

396
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,740
 AC and furnace guy, heater guy came over to the house.

397
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,060
 He was doing his final inspection

398
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,320
 and he's like that guy from New York,

399
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,580
 he's like kind of rough and tough

400
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,180
 and I'm like kind of sizing him up.

401
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,540
 Like, oh, you got, okay.

402
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,260
 I'll talk to you when we get to the driveway.

403
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,740
 You seem kind of intimidating.

404
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,540
 You're like, you kind of intimidate me a little bit.

405
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,980
 So we walked out after he did his final inspection.

406
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,940
 I just said, "Hey, Terry.

407
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,560
 "Hey, bro, I got a question for you.

408
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,260
 "Hey, before you go, man, we've had some great conversations.

409
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,980
 "Thanks for sharing your story."

410
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,820
 That's what I did.

411
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,660
 I just said, "Hey, man, what's your story?"

412
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,380
 He began to go into it.

413
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,380
 I said, "Hey, Terry.

414
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,220
 "Hey, do you have a faith?"

415
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,920
 He said, "Ah, I'm a non-practicing Catholic."

416
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,880
 I'm like, non-practice, I don't even know what that means,

417
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,080
 but I didn't say that.

418
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,920
 But I was like, "Oh, okay.

419
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,480
 "So Terry, hey, like I've been pondering this question.

420
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,520
 "It's not really unique to you.

421
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,360
 "I ask it to a lot of different people.

422
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,520
 "But if I was to ask you, Terry, who goes to heaven?

423
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,680
 "What would you say?"

424
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,040
 He thought about it for a minute

425
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,040
 and he said, "Those people that do good works."

426
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,340
 I said, "Man, I appreciate your honesty.

427
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,980
 "I thought that way for a long time."

428
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,820
 And at this point, man, I'm like,

429
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,180
 "What's going on?

430
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,640
 "Did I say everything?

431
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,620
 "Like he might get mad."

432
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,260
 And I'm like, "Hey, Terry, here's another question.

433
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,760
 "If we get to heaven based on our good works,

434
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,100
 "how do you know if you've done enough good work?"

435
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,540
 He said, "Oh, man, I never really thought about that.

436
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,700
 "I guess you don't."

437
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,300
 And I said, "A second question, Terry.

438
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,660
 "If you can get to heaven based on your own works,

439
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,100
 "what was the point of Jesus dying on the cross?"

440
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:56,200
 And I said, "Terry, can I just tell you something, man?

441
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,580
 "Like there's a God in heaven and he loves you.

442
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,600
 "And he looked down on you and me 2,021 years ago

443
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,180
 "because he didn't see fit to leave you and me in our sin.

444
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,420
 "And perfection left heaven

445
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,780
 "and it collided with imperfection.

446
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,900
 "And he went through agony for you, man.

447
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,920
 "He went to the cross.

448
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,340
 "His perfection went to the cross

449
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,900
 "and he took on our imperfection."

450
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,940
 And I said, "Those nails that were in his hands, man.

451
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,980
 "Hey, Terry, Terry, those nails in his hands

452
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,500
 "were every time your hands and my hands

453
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,700
 "have been to places that they should never have gone."

454
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,700
 I said, "The nail in his feet, Terry."

455
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,320
 I said, "It's for every time we've taken our feet to places

456
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,160
 "that should never have gone.

457
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,100
 "Hey, the crown of thorns that sits right above your eyes,

458
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,420
 "Terry, or right above Christ's eyes, right?

459
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,100
 "It's for every time you looked at thing,

460
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,760
 "every time I looked at something

461
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,800
 "or I thought of something

462
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,980
 "that I shouldn't have looked at or thought of."

463
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,300
 The hatred in your heart, the adultery in your heart,

464
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,900
 the lust that you have towards women.

465
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,140
 Man, I got it too, bro.

466
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:03,580
 I said, "The way they whipped Jesus

467
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,060
 "before he went to the cross,

468
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,680
 "at the end of whips were glass

469
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,620
 "and sharp metal objects and nails.

470
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,200
 "And they whipped him and they pulled out chunks of flesh

471
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,200
 "for every time you and I have turned our back against God."

472
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,280
 I said, "Terry, if you could get to heaven

473
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,260
 "based on your good works,

474
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,980
 "what was the point of Jesus doing all that?"

475
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,020
 There was no point, man.

476
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,640
 He knew that you couldn't do enough good things

477
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,700
 to get to him.

478
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,260
 That's why he had to come down.

479
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,440
 Do you know that Jesus, Terry?

480
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,880
 Tonight, do you know that kind of Jesus?

481
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,620
 Do you know that God tonight

482
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,500
 who left heaven and went to the cross for you and me,

483
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,280
 died a sinner's death?

484
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,580
 History records and scripture says three days later,

485
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,820
 he rose again from the dead to defeat sin and death.

486
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,500
 And when you put your faith not in your good works,

487
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,560
 Terry, or porch tonight,

488
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,380
 but you put your faith in Christ,

489
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,540
 he forgives your sin and he changes your heart

490
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,940
 and not only your heart, but your entire life.

491
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,940
 Do you know that God?

492
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,180
 Do you know that God?

493
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,520
 Listen, I'm not naive.

494
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,020
 Like, I'm not.

495
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,380
 To think that the wrong that you brought into this place,

496
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,980
 anything that you brought into this place,

497
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,340
 like, and I've probably done too,

498
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,220
 like, that's my story.

499
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,780
 I was playing college baseball

500
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,620
 and chasing the party and alcohol

501
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,060
 and women and pornography.

502
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,540
 Not proud of it.

503
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,820
 That's just my life, man.

504
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,460
 And then I collided with this message

505
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,600
 that I just shared with you.

506
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,980
 It's the gospel, the good news of Jesus.

507
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,740
 And he repurposed me.

508
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,980
 And listen, I didn't find life until I lost my life.

509
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,380
 Matthew 16, 25 says,

510
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,060
 "If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it.

511
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,460
 But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it."

512
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,780
 And you're like, no, man, you're naive, Josiah.

513
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,620
 No, I'm not, man.

514
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,840
 Life is found in Christ, I promise you.

515
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,680
 You're missing out.

516
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,500
 Like, you're stuck in the same routine,

517
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,900
 expecting different results.

518
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,580
 Sin's robbing you of creativity.

519
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,020
 You go back to the bar, you get drunk,

520
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,540
 and you're hitting repeat on the weekend.

521
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,380
 Like, that's not life.

522
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,420
 That's quite old, man.

523
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,180
 It gets old.

524
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,340
 Like, waking up to strangers, hugging the toilet,

525
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,300
 taking that pregnancy.

526
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,100
 Like, come on, you know that.

527
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,900
 But you keep going back to the same thing,

528
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,020
 expecting a different result.

529
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:47,120
 That was my life until Christ changed it.

530
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,560
 That's why Paul continues in verse 12.

531
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,140
 And he says this,

532
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,660
 "I don't mean that I've already achieved these things,

533
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,460
 that I've already reached perfection."

534
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,860
 I love that.

535
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,940
 Like, some of you coming into this place,

536
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,900
 you know, Christians, they just think they're perfect.

537
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,400
 And no, man, that's the furthest thing.

538
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,060
 But we know the one who is perfect,

539
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,900
 and we're chasing after him.

540
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,740
 And so Paul says,

541
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,180
 "Not that I've already achieved perfection,

542
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,860
 but I press on to possess the perfection

543
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,700
 for which Christ Jesus first possessed in me.

544
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,020
 No, dear brothers and sisters, I have not achieved it,

545
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,340
 but I focus on one thing, one thing.

546
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,460
 What's that one thing?

547
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,700
 I forget the past, and I look forward to what lies ahead.

548
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,820
 I press on to reach the end of the race

549
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,440
 and receive the heavenly prize

550
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,540
 for which God through Christ Jesus is calling us."

551
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,520
 Life is in Jesus, friends.

552
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,140
 Like, some of you, man, you're stuck in your shame

553
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,660
 and your guilt and condemnation,

554
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,380
 and it's keeping you down.

555
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:50,900
 And Christ would say, "Hey, I died for that thing.

556
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,620
 Quit replaying the tapes.

557
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,300
 Quit thinking that that has to keep you from knowing me.

558
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,660
 That's why I went to the cross.

559
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,800
 There was a separation, there was a chasm,

560
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,780
 but I bridged that chasm, and I love you."

561
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,980
 And if you ever doubt that, man, just look at the cross.

562
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,100
 If you ever doubt that love,

563
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,440
 would you be fixated on what Christ did for you on the cross?

564
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,660
 Listen, I haven't only lived this, man, I've seen it.

565
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,580
 Like, young adults are running after the world.

566
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,900
 They think they have everything going for them,

567
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,580
 and then all of a sudden, Christ intersects their life,

568
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,620
 and they change, he begins to change their purposes.

569
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,520
 They begin to filter everything they do

570
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,980
 and how they can know Christ, and they can make him known.

571
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,700
 What's gonna honor him with my life, with my decisions,

572
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,520
 with my relationships, with my successes?

573
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,700
 They begin to really live life.

574
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,340
 There's a few people I want you to meet tonight.

575
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,580
 Meet my friend Kat.

576
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,460
 This is what she says, "Apart from Christ,

577
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,340
 I thought my purpose was to make it in corporate America.

578
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,780
 I wanted to use my talents to appear successful

579
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,460
 before others and chase the highs of life.

580
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,540
 More specifically, I was chasing materialism,

581
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,380
 the party scene, and alcohol.

582
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,140
 But now that Christ has changed my life,

583
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,540
 I find every part of my identity and purpose in him.

584
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,060
 The worldly satisfaction of highs I was chasing

585
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,180
 have been replaced by a loving relationship with God,

586
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,020
 his people, and his mission."

587
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,880
 Meet my friend Kyle.

588
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,700
 "Before Christ, I thought I'd find purpose

589
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,380
 in being able to provide for myself

590
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,220
 with a lifestyle that marked comfortability

591
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,500
 and independence as a former SMU football player

592
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,300
 and frat guy.

593
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,100
 I thought Christians were weird, weak, and boring.

594
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,620
 I wanted to live a comfortable life

595
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,260
 and call the shots and be the man, but it was exhausting.

596
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,980
 These pursuits only led to empty wells

597
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,940
 that always ran dry.

598
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,340
 Sure, there was temporal highs,

599
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,980
 but never anything sustaining.

600
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:54,040
 The purpose found in knowing God and making him known

601
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,760
 was one of the greatest blessings I've ever experienced.

602
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,640
 I surrendered my life to Christ

603
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,080
 and put his ways above the world's ways,

604
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,080
 and everything began to change."

605
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,300
 Meet my friend Leslie.

606
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,580
 "I used to live for the approval of other people,

607
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,280
 but when I did, my heart always ached for something more.

608
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,060
 I wanted to be thinner, more beautiful, and more loved.

609
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,400
 I thought that Miss Texas, that crown,

610
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,240
 would give me status and purpose,

611
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,640
 but God helped me see that the only thing I needed

612
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,720
 to find joy in and affirmation and value in

613
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,760
 was an abiding relationship with him.

614
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,920
 Now that I'm a daughter of the king,

615
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,960
 I've received a gift of grace,

616
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,800
 and it's so much more beautiful and eternally valuable

617
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,120
 than I could ever imagine.

618
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,360
 My purpose shifted from glorifying myself

619
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,900
 to glorifying the one who matters.

620
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:45,220
 I spent my time starving myself before photo shoots,

621
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,140
 but now I have purpose in serving Christ.

622
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,560
 I get to do that every week at the porch."

623
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,400
 Meet my friend Joe.

624
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,080
 "Before Christ, I was marked by two fleeting purposes.

625
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,420
 The first, career success.

626
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,160
 If I just had a good job, increasing levels of control

627
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,080
 and power, and of course, more money.

628
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,200
 The second purpose, to have a lot of friends.

629
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,800
 I wanted to be so liked.

630
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
 I wanted to be seen.

631
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,720
 I want to be known.

632
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,840
 That's the biggest reason why I identified as bisexual

633
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,240
 for almost six years.

634
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,120
 I didn't want anything to prohibit me

635
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,000
 from people potentially liking me or showing me affection.

636
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,720
 My life mantra was to work hard, play harder,

637
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,480
 play with as many friends as possible,

638
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,680
 and my purpose is fed into that perfectly.

639
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,320
 But then Christ redefined my purpose,

640
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,880
 to know him and to make him known,

641
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,680
 to share the good news of God's grace through Jesus

642
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,920
 by serving others and putting their needs above my own."

643
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:43,620
 Listen, friends, those are real people with real problems,

644
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,020
 but they have a real purpose.

645
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,920
 Like those people are here tonight.

646
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,240
 They serve week in and week out,

647
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,400
 this gathering that we call The Porch.

648
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,640
 And listen, there'll be a team of people and myself,

649
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,760
 these people that you just heard their stories

650
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,440
 right here after service.

651
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,840
 And if you don't believe it, man, come and talk to them.

652
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,680
 And they can share way more than I ever did.

653
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,080
 And now for you, let me ask you, fill in the blank.

654
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,320
 My name is blank.

655
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,480
 My problem is blank.

656
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,040
 And my purpose is blank.

657
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,940
 And tonight, if you don't know the answer to that purpose,

658
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,460
 then tonight, come listen, I'm begging you,

659
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,380
 I'm pleading with you.

660
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,500
 Like I said, I don't get paid anymore.

661
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,380
 If you come to Christ, like I'm asking you tonight,

662
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,960
 would you consider Christ?

663
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,020
 Would you consider knowing him and making him known?

664
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,260
 Once you know Jesus and you have no choice

665
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,500
 than to make him known, which is point number two,

666
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,020
 make Jesus known.

667
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,260
 The same guy in Philippians 3, Paul,

668
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,300
 he goes on and says in Acts 20, 24,

669
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,540
 it's my life verse.

670
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,700
 I mean, call it cheesy, whatever you want,

671
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,140
 but this is what Paul says.

672
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,580
 He says, "But my life is worth nothing to me."

673
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,420
 What?

674
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,380
 Like that's crazy.

675
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,340
 Every time I read that, nothing, Paul?

676
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,940
 Like, what do you mean your life is worth nothing to me?

677
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,780
 Look at what he says.

678
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,340
 "But my life is worth nothing to me

679
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,780
 unless I use it for," what?

680
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,580
 "Finishing the work assigned to me by my Lord Jesus,

681
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,540
 the work of telling others the good news," about what?

682
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,020
 His wonderful grace.

683
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:22,980
 His wonderful grace.

684
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,980
 You are made, you were born to know him

685
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,940
 and to make him known through your job.

686
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,140
 You're born to make him known

687
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,620
 through your apartment complex.

688
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,240
 You make him known through your relationships.

689
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,180
 And because of my position here at the staff,

690
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,100
 like listen, I get a front row seat

691
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,840
 to watch Christ intersect the lives of young adults

692
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,740
 here in Dallas, not just here in Dallas,

693
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,860
 all over the nation, in Houston,

694
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,580
 in rural Ballaton, Minnesota, in Philadelphia,

695
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,020
 in Scottsdale, in Indianapolis.

696
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,140
 I see you, come on.

697
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,420
 And God is using young adults all over the world

698
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,860
 to be mobilized, to be equipped, to share this message.

699
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:05,860
 It's like God gives young adults a key.

700
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:10,540
 And that key is their testimony, their story of grace,

701
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,380
 how he's repurposed them.

702
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,940
 And that key is the gospel, the good news of Jesus.

703
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,540
 And these young adults begin to live life

704
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,180
 and they begin to live on mission.

705
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,020
 And they go and they look at other people

706
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,780
 and they interact with other people

707
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,580
 that are sitting in the same prisons

708
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,740
 that they used to sit in.

709
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,780
 And they take that key, their testimony in the gospel,

710
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,180
 and they begin to unlock those prisons

711
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,720
 that they used to sit in.

712
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,800
 Like it's crazy, y'all.

713
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,260
 Like that is life, that is incredible.

714
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,100
 There's nothing on the face of the planet

715
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,780
 that can change a human heart than Christ.

716
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:49,740
 And we're seeing God move all over the nation and world.

717
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,420
 And listen, if you're longing to be a part of something

718
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,660
 bigger than yourself,

719
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,980
 something that's changing the world, let's go.

720
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,480
 Listen, Satan, man, he's real.

721
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,280
 Like his MO is to steal, kill, and destroy.

722
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,940
 The Bible says he prowls around like a roaring lion

723
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,300
 seeking those he can devour.

724
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,300
 And listen, some of you are being devoured tonight.

725
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,060
 Let me just be real.

726
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,140
 Like I was.

727
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,660
 Thinking that I found life, but I didn't.

728
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:20,580
 And his entire goal is for you to make those things

729
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,900
 that really aren't important,

730
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,060
 make those things really, really important in your life.

731
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,940
 And those things that are really, really important,

732
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,020
 to make those things seem not very important.

733
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,980
 That's his game plan.

734
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,940
 He's switching price tags tonight.

735
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,940
 The things of infinite value, the things of eternal worth,

736
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,420
 he tries to make them worthless in your eyes.

737
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,220
 And the things of Dallas, he tries to make those things

738
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,180
 appeal to your heart so that you would invest your time,

739
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,140
 your talents, and your treasures in those things.

740
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,380
 God is building a kingdom.

741
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,740
 And he's inviting us to play a part of the kingdom.

742
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:58,580
 And he's gonna feature this work for all of eternity.

743
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,660
 But you must stay in a relationship with Christ.

744
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,340
 You must know him.

745
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,420
 You can do that through getting in his word.

746
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,780
 You can do that through community.

747
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,460
 What we call here is small groups of men and women

748
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,180
 that have changed their playground and their playmates,

749
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,180
 and they're all in.

750
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,720
 You can do that through serving.

751
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,220
 You can leave this place and go up to next first,

752
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,920
 not next steps, first steps.

753
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,220
 And listen, you've been making excuses week in and week out,

754
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,100
 saying, "I'm not going there."

755
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,260
 You can come right here in front of the stage.

756
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,900
 I'll stay up here as long as you want.

757
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,700
 And we can talk.

758
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,480
 But he's using people just like you

759
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,740
 to change the world.

760
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,120
 But some of us are saying to God,

761
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,300
 "Hey God, thanks for making me,

762
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,500
 "but I'll live life the way I wanna do it."

763
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,300
 And let me tell you, if you live for the world,

764
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,300
 we will die without ever doing what we were created to do.

765
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,380
 And we will forfeit an opportunity

766
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,540
 to be a part of the eternal kingdom.

767
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,040
 And some of us, man, we're living that right now.

768
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,220
 You think all you are is an account manager.

769
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,500
 All you are is a barista.

770
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,180
 All you are is a marketing person.

771
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,340
 All you are is a nurse.

772
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:09,340
 All you are, all you are is a teacher.

773
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,460
 And God's saying, "No, that's not all you are.

774
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,780
 "I created you to build a kingdom in a foreign land

775
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,380
 "and I've put you on mission

776
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,500
 "and you have the opportunity tonight

777
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,600
 "to not get so caught up in the world

778
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,660
 "and forsake that mission,

779
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,680
 "but you have an opportunity

780
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,200
 "to do what I've called you to do."

781
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,100
 And listen, everyone you share Christ with,

782
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,960
 you know what's gonna happen?

783
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,460
 You're gonna see them in eternity

784
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,540
 and they're gonna be thankful.

785
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,880
 And everyone you share Christ with

786
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,780
 that's not in heaven,

787
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,740
 they're gonna be thankful that you did.

788
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,680
 So what are you living for tonight?

789
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,940
 What's your purpose?

790
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,300
 Why are you created?

791
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,100
 Do you know Jesus?

792
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,740
 Are you living to make him known?

793
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:55,220
 Paul, his mantra,

794
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,940
 the first chapter of the book of Philippians

795
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,020
 that we study tonight,

796
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,740
 the crux of the entire message is this.

797
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,160
 He says it in verse 21 of Philippians 1.

798
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,880
 It's a coffee cup verse.

799
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,020
 People get it tattooed on their body.

800
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,200
 Man, you see it on T-shirts.

801
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,480
 But this is what Paul says.

802
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,400
 To live is Christ

803
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,280
 and to die is gain.

804
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,520
 You know what he's saying there?

805
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,360
 You know what he's saying?

806
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,480
 He's saying, hey, if Christ is your purpose,

807
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,860
 then death is your promotion.

808
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,360
 Like when did we think that heaven wasn't enough?

809
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,680
 Like when did we think that,

810
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,640
 man, I think some of us, man,

811
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,840
 we think that heaven is just kind of this ethereal,

812
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,540
 this just kind of in the sky somewhere,

813
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,940
 but the Bible's very clear.

814
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,240
 It's a new heavens and a new earth.

815
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,980
 Can you imagine a place without any pain,

816
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,920
 without any heartbreak?

817
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,920
 Like study the Garden of Eden

818
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,120
 before sin entered the world.

819
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,280
 It was a perfect place.

820
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,800
 It was a material place.

821
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,720
 Can you imagine a place without murder,

822
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,160
 a place without strife,

823
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,000
 a place without anxiety and fear?

824
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 That's what our hearts long for.

825
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,000
 And God's saying, hey,

826
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,600
 there's gonna be a new heavens and a new earth

827
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,320
 that I'm gonna usher in.

828
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,800
 And the former things have passed away.

829
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,240
 And God says, hey, I'm gonna make all things new

830
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,680
 and it's gonna be a place of perfection

831
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,200
 forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.

832
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,640
 And as we close,

833
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:26,080
 I want you to think of your life like this ladder,

834
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,280
 this ladder.

835
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,240
 Like if this ladder represents your life,

836
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,600
 then the rungs on this ladder,

837
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,000
 the steps on this ladder,

838
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,560
 it represents the decades of your life.

839
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,160
 And you know what's tragic

840
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,440
 is when you meet someone in their 70s or 80s,

841
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,840
 I talk to them all the time,

842
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,120
 and they climb the ladder of success

843
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,060
 and the ladder of relationships

844
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,160
 and the ladder of health,

845
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,120
 and they get to the top of that ladder

846
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,560
 only to realize, man, those things were important,

847
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,680
 but they just weren't ultimate.

848
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,760
 Like they missed their purpose in those things.

849
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,820
 And so some of us tonight,

850
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,040
 like we come into this place

851
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,240
 and we're in our 20s

852
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,360
 and we're like, man, I graduated from college

853
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,200
 and man, I'm gonna go to grad school

854
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,640
 and then man, I'm gonna land that job.

855
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,560
 You know, that job that's gonna pay me six figures.

856
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,400
 Like I'm gonna make it,

857
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,000
 I'm gonna get that corner office.

858
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,880
 Like I'm gonna get that promotion

859
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,240
 and you're in your 20s

860
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,120
 or you're nearing the end of your 20s

861
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,480
 and you're still single,

862
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,480
 like you're still single

863
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,340
 and the shot clock of getting married,

864
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,200
 you feel like it's ticking.

865
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,560
 And so you get into your 30s,

866
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,960
 you go from your 20s to your 30s,

867
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,480
 you're like, man, my important endeavor,

868
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,240
 the most important thing is that I find a spouse,

869
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,120
 that I find somebody.

870
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,280
 And I mean, listen, you kind of did this thing

871
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,080
 your entire life, it was relationships,

872
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,760
 like you pursued popularity

873
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,700
 and then you got to college

874
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,720
 and you did the whole Greek life,

875
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,440
 that sorority and that fraternity.

876
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,880
 And now that you're single, it's like, man,

877
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,320
 I'm gonna pursue relationships,

878
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,360
 that's what's gonna happen.

879
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,240
 Then not only that, you're in your 20s

880
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,160
 or end of your 20s and your 30s

881
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,360
 and you're like, I'm gonna pursue a woman

882
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,960
 or I'm gonna pursue a guy

883
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,140
 so that I can get that family.

884
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,320
 So in my 30s, like I started having kids

885
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,160
 and I want that perfect family,

886
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,040
 the one that the kids are matching

887
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,320
 and you take pictures

888
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,800
 and everyone's kind of is envious

889
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,320
 and jealous of your kids.

890
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,720
 And then you get to like, I don't know,

891
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,560
 end of your 30s and you're like,

892
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,040
 man, I'm gonna start that company,

893
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,760
 that company that you always wanted to start

894
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,320
 and you're like, this is my, man,

895
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,720
 this is the decade y'all.

896
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,960
 Like I'm gonna land that company,

897
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,760
 like it's gonna happen.

898
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,240
 Like, yeah, I'm getting it off the ground,

899
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,320
 hell and high water, it's gonna happen.

900
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,040
 Come on.

901
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,880
 And you're like, man,

902
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,760
 I got to pursue health in the middle of all this

903
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,080
 and so I'm gonna do that CrossFit,

904
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,800
 I'm gonna do that cycle bar,

905
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,960
 I'm gonna eat kale and spinach and those shakes,

906
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,160
 but not the ones that have sugar in it,

907
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,760
 like I'm going all out, come on.

908
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,880
 And you just start pursuing all these different things

909
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,480
 and you get to the top of the ladder,

910
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,120
 you get to the top of the life

911
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,520
 and you made it, man.

912
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,920
 Like you landed the company.

913
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,240
 Like you got it off the ground,

914
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,880
 it's successful, it's making money.

915
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,040
 Like you got the spouse.

916
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,280
 Like you got the wife,

917
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,760
 you got the husband,

918
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,120
 you got the kids that you always wanted

919
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,120
 and so you're at the top of this ladder.

920
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,640
 I'm sorry, I'm making you nervous.

921
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,360
 But listen, you're at the top of the ladder right here

922
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,840
 and you look down at the ladder,

923
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,480
 you look down at all the successes

924
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,680
 and the relationships that you pursued

925
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,000
 and your health that you pursued

926
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,360
 and listen, man, those things aren't bad in themselves.

927
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,200
 They're actually really good things.

928
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,880
 But for some reason, you made them God things.

929
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,120
 Like they became an idol in your life

930
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,480
 and you missed out on the one purpose that God said,

931
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,640
 hey, as you pursue these other things,

932
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,480
 would you know me and would you make me known?

933
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,640
 And so you look down and you're like,

934
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,760
 man, I haven't known Christ any more than I did

935
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,120
 when I walked the aisle and I said the sinner's prayer

936
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,680
 and that thing that happened at church camp, right?

937
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,120
 I surely ain't making them known in these endeavors.

938
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,960
 And so you get down from the ladder of your life

939
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,840
 and you just begin to replay the tape

940
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,960
 and you thought the things that you were pursuing

941
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,920
 were gonna give you the purpose,

942
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,160
 but they don't.

943
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:44,120
 And listen, you look down at the ladder

944
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,200
 and you see a life that,

945
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,160
 sure, man, you accomplished some things,

946
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,280
 but it's a life that's quite frankly wasted.

947
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,960
 And here's what I've learned to be true.

948
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,720
 As I've sought to know Christ with my life

949
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,640
 and to make him known,

950
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,880
 continue to have faithfulness over the rungs of the ladder

951
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,360
 that represents the decades of my life,

952
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,840
 then one day I'm gonna get to the top of that ladder,

953
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,840
 the top of my life, and I'm gonna realize,

954
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,040
 like, man, I pursued these things,

955
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,640
 but I had Christ in its proper place

956
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,480
 and he began to give meaning and purpose to my life.

957
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,280
 He began to give meaning and purpose in all these things

958
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,640
 and God used my time, God used my achievements,

959
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,560
 God used my relationships, God used even my health

960
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,720
 to know him and to make him known.

961
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,440
 And some of you, the tragedy is this,

962
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,880
 you don't believe me.

963
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,080
 You're like, man, I'm gonna try, I'm gonna prove you wrong.

964
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
 Well, here's what I want you to do, man.

965
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,020
 When you get to 50 or 60, I want you to call me.

966
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,960
 Like, I want you to email me.

967
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,480
 Because I don't think you're gonna,

968
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,160
 I don't think you're right.

969
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,040
 Like, I've talked to the 50-year-olds,

970
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,640
 I've talked to 60s, I've talked to 70s,

971
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,080
 I've talked to people on their deathbed.

972
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:05,160
 I promise that whatever you're doing,

973
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,160
 CEO or working at a coffee shop,

974
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,020
 if you pair them with the ultimate thing,

975
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,760
 which is knowing Jesus and making him known,

976
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,220
 listen, if you don't believe me,

977
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,600
 then come find the names that I read earlier.

978
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,840
 If you think your purpose is found in beauty,

979
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,680
 come find Leslie.

980
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,960
 If you think your purpose is found in corporate America,

981
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
 come find Kat.

982
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,760
 If you think your purpose is found in sports

983
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,400
 and making money, come find Kyle.

984
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,100
 If you think your purpose is found in, listen, listen,

985
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,480
 climbing this or climbing that,

986
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,540
 control and power or sexuality, come find my buddy Joe.

987
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:42,860
 We wanna talk to you.

988
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,880
 Like, some of you tonight,

989
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,980
 like, you're gonna walk out of this place.

990
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,540
 And you have the chance

991
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:55,060
 to live and learn,

992
00:40:55,060 --> 00:41:00,220
 which that's where life gives you a whooping.

993
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:05,380
 Or you have the chance to learn and then live.

994
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,260
 Not because of what I said tonight,

995
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,620
 but because of what the words from the past

996
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,780
 that tell about your future.

997
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:20,500
 So if your life is a ladder and every rung is a decade,

998
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,780
 how are you gonna spend your life?

999
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,460
 Like, we're wrapping up this series tonight,

1000
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,580
 fortune telling.

1001
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,860
 And if you will spend your future knowing Jesus

1002
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,980
 and making him known,

1003
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,780
 then watch what he will do with your obedience.

1004
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,100
 I promise you, man,

1005
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,700
 no one's ever got to the end of their life

1006
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,780
 and pursued those two things and regretted it.

1007
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,180
 It's never happened and it's never will.

1008
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,700
 And it never will.

1009
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,400
 Let me pray that it would tonight.

1010
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,440
 (congregation murmurs)

1011
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,920
 Father God, let me pray

1012
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,280
 that you would arrest our hearts,

1013
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,480
 that you would remind me in this moment

1014
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,440
 that if this message wasn't for anyone else,

1015
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
 God, it's for me.

1016
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,600
 I needed it.

1017
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,580
 God, that you would have your way.

1018
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,400
 God, that you would do a work that only you can do.

1019
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,420
 That you would help us to realize

1020
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:22,340
 that in the midst of all the endeavors that we could pursue,

1021
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,780
 help us to remember that you're the inventor

1022
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,720
 of all those endeavors.

1023
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,060
 And when we put you in your proper place

1024
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,460
 to make you known and to know you,

1025
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,820
 we will live a life of purpose.

1026
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,980
 And so whatever we find ourself doing tonight,

1027
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,620
 whether we're a janitor, whether we own a business,

1028
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,020
 whether we're flipping burgers,

1029
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,520
 or we're a doctor, a lawyer,

1030
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,480
 whatever prestigious occupation

1031
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,220
 that's in your mind right now, God,

1032
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:01,620
 would you have your way in our hearts

1033
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,100
 and would you put our lives on a path of purpose

1034
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,980
 for your glory, our joy, and the world's good.

1035
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,020
 It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

1036
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:19,020
