1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 The book of James is made up of 108 verses.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 54 of them are imperatives.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 An imperative is a command.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 That Jesus was not just his half-brother.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 He was his Lord.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 All right, what's up, friends of the room,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 friends of Fort Worth and Scottsdale, Arizona, Houston, Texas, Cedar Rapids, Iowa,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Southwest Minnesota, Northwest Arkansas, anybody joining us online.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 We are continuing this series on the book of James.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I'm going to read the passage.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 We're going to be in a James chapter 4.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 So if you have a Bible, you can flip open to James chapter 4,

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 start in verse 10, and we are going to continue this series

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 where we have been going week by week, verse by verse,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 through the book of James.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 So he says, starting in verse 10, if you don't have a Bible,

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 it will be up on the screens.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 "Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Brothers and sisters, do not slander one another

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 or speak evil against one another.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Anyone who speaks against a brother or sister or judges them

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 speaks against God's law and judges it.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 When you judge the law, you're not keeping it,

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 but sitting in judgment on it.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 There is only one lawgiver and judge

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 who is able to save and destroy.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 It's God.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 But you, who are you to judge your neighbor?

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Now listen, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow,

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 we will go to this city or that city,

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 spend a year there, carry on business, and make money.'

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Why?

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 You do not even know what will happen tomorrow.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 What is your life?

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 You are a mist that appears for a little while

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 and then vanishes.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Instead, you ought to say, 'If it is the Lord's will,

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 we will live and do this or that.'

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 All such boasting is evil.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 If anyone then knows the good that they ought to do

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 and doesn't do it, it is sin for them."

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Tonight, we're going to talk about the topic of pride.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 When you read that passage, you may go,

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 "Wait, wait, connect the dots on how it's pride."

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Well, he brings up and describes the pastor, James,

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 the half-brother of Jesus,

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 of somebody who lives a life that is not marked by humility,

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 where he starts out of humbling, and he says at the end,

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 "There's an arrogance that marks them,

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 and how they see their life and how they interact with people,

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 how they think about their plans,

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 how they make decisions in their actions."

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Pride is one of those things that candidly can be hard

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 because it's difficult to see in the mirror.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 It's an easy thing often to see in the life of somebody else,

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 but it can be hard for us to see it in ourself.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 This past week, I was at my son's--it was Thursday night.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 My son had a t-ball game. We're at the t-ball game.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 It's like the greatest thing ever to go to your son's t-ball game.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 We're having a blast. He's up there. They're learning how to hit.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 He's up to bat, and I'm holding my daughter at the time,

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 and she is, like, kind of fidgety, kind of squirming,

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 just, like, doing barrel rolls while I'm trying to hold her,

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 and I'm trying to film my son, who's going up to the tee,

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 and, you know, go get him slugger, and she continues to move.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 I can just tell she's kind of uncomfortable, and I'm thinking,

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 "Man, it's because it's about to be pastor bedtime.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 It's hot out here." Of course she's uncomfortable,

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 but, hey, just settle in. I'm trying to capture some video.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 As I'm doing that, I hear this--

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 [coughs]

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 and this audible, "Oh, gosh!"

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 from the people sitting right behind me

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 as my daughter just-- [gags]

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 all over my shoulder, and I pull her back to go,

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 "Oh, no. What's happening?"

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And she unloads a dumpster of vomit

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 unlike anything I've ever seen.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I hope you're not eating, and I'm not trying to make you sick right now,

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 but it was shocking. I mean, the amount--

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 I've never seen that much come out of a human,

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 let alone somebody who's this tall,

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 and it just continued, and there were chunks

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 all over me from my neck to my knees

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 to the point where the entire bleachers at the game,

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 it goes from like, "Go, Billy. You got this,"

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 to, "Oh! Oh! Whoa!"

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 People are pouring--they're running over with water bottles,

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 trying to pour them on me, literally,

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 to get the chunks that are off.

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I mean, whatever you're thinking, worse.

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 [laughter]

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 A guy, a total stranger--I don't even know who it is still--

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 came up and was like, "Here, you can have my shirt."

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 [laughter]

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 That's a true story.

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 I did a picture of it, but it's not really worth showing,

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 but a random stranger, "I have your shirt, so if you're out there,

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 thank you, Good Samaritan, or Angel."

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And it was just one of those, like, "Oh, man."

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And in the moment, I was like, "No, I'm good. I don't need your shirt."

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And he was like, "No, you need this shirt."

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 [laughter]

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 And I'm sitting there, and as I was thinking about this idea,

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I mean, it was very noticeable.

108
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 "Hey, I needed to change that shirt. I needed something else.

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 It was not okay for me to just go back, and I'm just going to sit down,

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 and everything will be okay, and we'll just, you know, pat up and play here."

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 That I was covered in something that was so disgusting,

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 whether or not I wanted to change shirt or get rid of it

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 or do anything about it, it was clear to everyone around me,

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 this is not okay, and it's disgusting.

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 What does that have to do with pride?

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Nothing. I just needed to tell somebody about what happened this past week. No.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 [laughter]

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 In the same way, and not in, honestly, even a joking way,

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 pride is one of those things that is covering so many people.

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And you can look on, and in a very similar way,

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 you see it, and pride is one of those things where it's just,

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 there's something repelling about it. It's disgusting.

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Someone just came into the room, and your life, your actions, words,

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 the way that you think, is covered in pride.

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Pride is one of those things that can be incredibly disruptive.

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 It's not just disgusting, where other people are like,

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 "Man, that is just, I'm repelled by that."

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 It also is destructive, and that pride erodes relationships.

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 It's impossible to have a relationship with someone who will never say,

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 "You know what? I was wrong. I'm sorry. Will you forgive me?"

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 It's impossible to have a relationship with someone who's prideful

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 because they're so obsessed with themselves,

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 and how everybody else didn't do everything for them and that person.

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 It's difficult to be in a dating relationship with someone who's so prideful.

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 They're always right, and you're always wrong.

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And pride can also not just look like, hey, a confident arrogance over the top.

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 It can also look like a person who's self-obsessed in an insecure way.

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 I'm so consumed with how I'm terrible, and I'm a terrible person.

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 That same self-centered focus exists there.

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Whether it's an outlandish pride, arrogance,

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 or it's the pride of just, I'm not worthy of anything.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Both of those can be examples of pride.

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Pride is one of those things that can be repelling,

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 it can be destructive to relationships, and it can--

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 is the thing that will keep people from having a relationship with God,

146
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 from spending eternity with God,

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 because they're not able to say, God,

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 I'll never be good enough to have a relationship with you.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 No matter how hard I try, church--

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 number of times I attend church, Bible verses I've read,

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 I'll never earn a relationship with you,

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 which is what Christianity believes.

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 But it does believe that you can accept it

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 by accepting the free gift that was offered to you and me on the cross.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And James today is going to go through

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 and help us see those blind spots of pride

157
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 and where pride may manifest in our life

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 and help give clarity to here's some ways

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 this is manifesting in your life.

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 We say around here that humility looks good on everyone.

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Humility is the little black dress that looks good every time.

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And in the same way, pride is one of those things

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 that just looks disgusting on everyone.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 So here's what I know. Let me promise you something.

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Guy or girl, if you walked into the room tonight

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 and you want to leave more attractive tonight,

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 if you will begin to put on humility,

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 you will be more attractive.

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 You got hit with the ugly stick when you were growing up, whatever happened,

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 you will leave here more attractive no matter what you look.

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Whatever girl out there is going to find you more attractive.

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Whatever guy out there will find you more attractive

173
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 if you put on humility.

174
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 And if you don't, and you allow pride to cover you,

175
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 it is a repelling, disgusting thing

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 and a destructive thing as we're going to see.

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 So we're going to walk through in verse 10.

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 We've been in the series, the book of James.

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 James is written by James, the half-brother of Jesus,

180
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 which is astounding to me. I never get over that.

181
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 The guy who grew up, Jesus had a younger brother, half-brother.

182
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 And he grew up and he lived in the same house with Jesus.

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 He learned all the teachings from Jesus.

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 He wasn't always a believer. For years and years, he wasn't.

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And then he saw his brother die on the cross and come back alive.

186
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And James became a believer in Jesus.

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 But James saw Jesus all throughout the stages of growing up.

188
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 And he learned the teachings that he writes down

189
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 in the earliest book in the New Testament called the book of James.

190
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 And tonight we're going to walk through what he says

191
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 is the posture of someone who's proud

192
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 and the humility that is to mark followers of Jesus.

193
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 So we're going to look at three things

194
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 where you might struggle with pride

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 if your life is marked by these three things.

196
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 We're going to look at three things that you might struggle with pride

197
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 if you and your life is marked by these things.

198
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 I'm going to start with the first one. Read it again.

199
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 "Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.

200
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 "Brothers and sisters, do not speak evil of one another.

201
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 "Anyone who speaks against a brother or sister judges them,

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 "and he speaks against God's law."

203
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 In other words, he doesn't look at God's law,

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 what God says about people, their neighbor, other believers, people in life.

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 He says, "I don't care what God thinks about them.

206
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 "Here's what I think about them."

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 When you judge the law, you're not keeping it.

208
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 You're sitting in judgment on the law.

209
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 In other words, you think you're better than God.

210
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 There's only one lawgiver and judge, and it's not you, and it's not me.

211
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 It's the one who's able to save and destroy.

212
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 But who are you to judge your neighbor?

213
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 So James brings up this idea of speaking evil, speaking bad about,

214
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 speaking in a condemning way towards other people,

215
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 whether it's directly to them or whether it's behind their back.

216
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Your translation may have the word "slander" and may have "speak evil,"

217
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 but it's just the idea of, "Hey, I am going to place and speak

218
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 "and put judgment on this person.

219
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 "They're not a good person because of X."

220
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 And James said, "The first way you know you might struggle with pride

221
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 "is if you put people down."

222
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 This is the type of person that considers people--

223
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 classifies, and we all do this to some degree.

224
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 When you think of people, and we can all think of people,

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 where it's like, "Man, you're a worse person than I am because of blank."

226
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Because of the sin struggle that you have or the past that you have,

227
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 you are worse or not as good of a person as I.

228
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 And James says that mentality, that line of thinking,

229
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 where you put people down,

230
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 where you judge them because of the job they have,

231
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 the life that they've lived, the actions they've had,

232
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 is a condemning, prideful, putting yourself in the position of God,

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 who is the only one who is able to rightly judge other people.

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Again, he's speaking about a condemning judgment of people in your life.

235
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 It can look like, "Man, I think less of you because--

236
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Honestly, this happens in dating all the time,

237
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 where it's like, "Man, this girl's damaged goods. Can't believe that."

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Which is not the response of a godly man.

239
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 In other words, I talk to girls all the time,

240
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 they got a part of a past, or guys all the time, they have a past,

241
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 and they're like, "Man, you talk about godly people up on there on the stage,

242
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 and I'm telling you, they're not looking for someone like me

243
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 because I got a history of regret,

244
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 dysfunctional relationships, sexual past."

245
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 I want to be abundantly clear.

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 A godly guy is like Jesus,

247
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 which means he doesn't hold sins of your past against you.

248
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Sins, if you're not actively following and pursuing Jesus,

249
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 those are concerns that he should rightly have.

250
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 But if you're someone who's like, "Man, I've surrendered, I've gone all in with Jesus,"

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 if a godly guy doesn't see you like Jesus sees you,

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 which is, I don't define you by your past,

253
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 you're a godly guy, or a godly girl.

254
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 But a person who speaks judgment and condemns based on the behavior

255
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 and thinks that I'm better with somebody

256
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 is the person James is talking about.

257
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 I mean, this candidly happens so often with Christians,

258
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 and it's so tragic where there's not a posture of like,

259
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 "I'm going to extend the benefit of the doubt to you,"

260
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 or a humility to go, "Man, if I was in your shoes,

261
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 I bet I would struggle with the same thing."

262
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 This can happen with same-sex attraction,

263
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 where we can categorize these different sins that God doesn't categorize.

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Where if you struggle with that, man, that's just,

265
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 "Oh, I don't know what to even do with that."

266
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 You have no idea what it's like to live in the life in the shoes of somebody else.

267
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 None of us do.

268
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 The number of people who I've met with down here at the front by the stage

269
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 that have had sexual abuse in their past,

270
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 and that trickled into their life and began to have ripple effects in every direction.

271
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 And since that day, they've struggled with same-sex attraction.

272
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 They've struggled with some sort of identity thing or identity issue.

273
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 And for you to look at somebody and say, "Man, I cannot believe that you do X,"

274
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 and I'm not saying celebration or embracing sin at all.

275
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 I'm saying the way that we think about, we talk to people, we put people down,

276
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 James would say, "It is pride."

277
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 I was talking to a counselor one time, and I was talking about,

278
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 honestly, pride in my own life of people that I was like,

279
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 "Man, just this type of person that I'll leave out to work with,

280
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 or my life, just kind of annoy me."

281
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And I was listing out some of the characteristics, and I don't even know what to do with that.

282
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And he said, "The proper response to someone who has those behavioral characteristics,

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 if it's like Jesus, should be compassion."

284
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And I was like, "Yeah, I know. I need to grow in that."

285
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And he said, "The way you grow in that is by being gripped by grace."

286
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And he said, "All those annoying characteristics of behavior things,

287
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 and all the different things that different people in your life annoy you about,

288
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 or that you're like, 'I can't believe that they would do that,'

289
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 or that we're prone to look down on, and 'I can't believe that she is X.

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 I can't believe that he's this way. I can't believe I will.'"

291
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Reflect the fact that I have forgotten the tail line that, but for God's grace,

292
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 I would be that same way.

293
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Without God moving inside of my life, there's no reason that I wouldn't have the same struggles

294
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 or same challenges or same behavioral problems that other people have.

295
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 And the only reason I don't is because of God's grace, period.

296
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 He said, "The more you can get gripped in that, the more that you,

297
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 rather than being annoyed or repulsed, you feel compassion and patience and love

298
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 and thankfulness to God, because there's nothing in your life that is good

299
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 that I can take responsibility for or credit for."

300
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 1 Corinthians 4 says this exact idea where it says, "Hey, what do you have that you did not receive?

301
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?"

302
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 The poet would say, "Everything in your life, everything you think is great and awesome,

303
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 it's because I really worked hard, all of that was a gift.

304
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 You can't take credit for the family you were born in.

305
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 If you worked really hard and you got through college and you made it into grad school

306
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 or an Ivy League school, you don't have credit for that."

307
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 And you're like, "No, dude, I worked really hard."

308
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Who gave you the strength to work really hard?

309
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Who gave you the mind to work through and take exams and to do tests?

310
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 There's no reason why you would have been given those types of opportunities.

311
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 You can't take credit over your sexual history or sexual past,

312
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 because maybe you're like, "Dude, I've dated, I've done everything right."

313
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 You can't take credit for that.

314
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Who placed in your life people that were a source of protection,

315
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 maybe a father that came along and he was like, "Hey, sex is for marriage.

316
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 You're going to want to save this one."

317
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Who was the person who provided a healthy family that some of you guys come from?

318
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 And when you think of it, you're like, "Man, people should just try harder."

319
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 You can't take credit for so many of the different things, the job that you have today.

320
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 It's all a gift from a God who allowed you to, in an interview process,

321
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 say the right things and have the right credentials to have that.

322
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 And James is saying the same way your whole life.

323
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 You shouldn't have a posture of any part of you that thinks, "I'm better than anyone,"

324
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 but a posture that says, "Anything that I have that is good is from God.

325
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 And anything that I see in other people's lives should drive me to prayer and patience

326
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 and not speaking and putting other people down."

327
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 And he would say, "Here's how you know you struggle with pride.

328
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 If you put people down, you put others down with the words that you use."

329
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 He continues and says another characteristic,

330
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 the second way that you can know you might struggle with pride.

331
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 "Now listen, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we'll go to this city or that city,

332
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 spend a year there, carry on business, and make money.'"

333
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Why? You do not even know what will happen tomorrow.

334
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 What is your life?

335
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 You're a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.

336
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 So James brings up plans.

337
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Anybody, who's a planner in this room?

338
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Like, man, I'm just planning. I got 2023 already on lock.

339
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Anybody? Anybody not a planner in here?

340
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Okay, and who, where's the planners again?

341
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 There's like 25 planners. This world is falling apart.

342
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 James brings up the subject of planning.

343
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 I would fall in the category of not loving plans.

344
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 This is not my thing, but I am so thankful for planners.

345
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Did James just throw shade at anybody who makes plans?

346
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 No. He throws shade at the posture behind those plans.

347
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Young adult years are just by nature, they are a time of a lot of planning,

348
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 whether it's on a minor scale, and you got that calendar, you got triple calendars,

349
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 or it's on a mega scale of like, here, I'm planning when I'm going to get married,

350
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 I'm planning the future that I have, I'm envisioning the financial future that I'm going to have,

351
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 and when I'm going to get out of debt, and home that I'm going to live in someday.

352
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 My future, you know, influencer status that I'm working on and building my way up to,

353
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 and my Etsy account over here. It's just a time of a lot of planning.

354
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 James' point is not that plans are bad.

355
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 He's talking about the posture behind those plans.

356
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 And he brings up really two problems that are associated with the posture

357
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 that James says you and I are not to have.

358
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 So he brings up, you might struggle with plight, if you plan like you are in control.

359
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 How do I know if I have a posture that plans like I'm in control,

360
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 and a posture that James would say is a prideful one?

361
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Well, there's two problems that he brings up.

362
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 The first is planning and living life as though I'm in control,

363
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 which sets you up for a recipe of eventually discovering that all the plans and everything that I hope

364
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 and all the things that I think I'm in control,

365
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 eventually are going to collide with the direction that God's going to take life.

366
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 That contradicts mine.

367
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And that can either lead me to react and trust in, or lean in,

368
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 or to repel and move away from God.

369
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 My four-year-old, five-year-old now, from time to time will go down to the school,

370
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 and that's down the block from our house, and we'll drive the golf cart.

371
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 I have this golf cart that's kind of a fixer-upper thing that we'll drive down there.

372
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Let him sit on my lap. And it's the greatest thing ever when you're a five-year-old,

373
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 because I'll let him sit and I'll let him drive.

374
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And we'll be driving along, and he's turning it, and he's just like,

375
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 "This is the greatest thing ever," because he's five.

376
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And sometimes we'll be taking the trip down there,

377
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 and there's a car that's parked on the street, and he will be heading,

378
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 and he thinks it's funny to be like, "Oh, let's hit the car,"

379
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 and it's like, "Not hitting the car. Daddy can't afford it."

380
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 And we will be confronted with the fact that he thinks he's in control,

381
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 and he wants to go right, and his dad will take him left,

382
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 or he doesn't know how to get home, and so he'll go right,

383
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 and dad will take him left in order to get us home.

384
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 God has a relationship with us.

385
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 We're like a father. We're invited to sit on the lap of God and walk along,

386
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 and there will be times like he gives us decisions and options,

387
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 and you get to decide so much--not everything, but often your life

388
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 and the decisions that you're making.

389
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 There will still come times where all the plans and things--

390
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 this is where the future that I saw coming.

391
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And you'll think we're going right, and God will take a left.

392
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 You think that relationship--that was a healthy relationship.

393
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 They were a godly person. Maybe you met them at church,

394
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 and you thought they were the one, and for whatever reason, God said,

395
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 "No, we've got someone else."

396
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 The job that you thought, like, "Man, this was it,

397
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 "and I feel like I've been stuck at the same position for three years.

398
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 "When am I ever going to get the promotion?"

399
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 And that moment comes, and you think it's coming, and it doesn't.

400
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 The grad school that you applied into that you were so hoping,

401
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 like, "If I don't get into this one, I'm going to have to move cities,"

402
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 and you didn't get in.

403
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 And in those moments when you're trying to go right,

404
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 and you see God's plan is clearly going left,

405
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 the choice before all of us is to go, "Man, there's a God who's in control.

406
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 "I can trust him. I can lean in.

407
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 "If he's taking that direction, even though I didn't want to go that direction,

408
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 "I can trust him, or I can do what a five-year-old does,

409
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 "which is freak out and cry and be like, 'God, where are you?

410
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 "'And you don't care about me.'"

411
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And I'm not trying to invalidate any of the pain and challenges

412
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 because it is terrible to break up with the person

413
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 that you thought you were going to move forward.

414
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 It is heartbreaking to not get the promotion or feel like you're stuck.

415
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 But James would say, "You live in a world where you've never been in control.

416
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 "And when God goes left and you want him to go right,

417
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 "you can either trust him, or you can allow the fact

418
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 "that it's not going the way that you hoped it to, to push you away from God."

419
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 And he would say, "Hold on. You can trust him."

420
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 We'll talk about more of that in a second.

421
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 The second problem of the person who plans,

422
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 and the posture that James would say, "This is the type of planning

423
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 "that is really destructive," is that their plans are all about themselves.

424
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 They're not about what God has, about God's will.

425
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 And he describes a person who's a go-getter.

426
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Hey, this person comes up, says, "Today, tomorrow, we're going to the city.

427
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 "We're going to make a profit. I'm going to start this business,

428
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 "and it's going to be amazing."

429
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And their whole pursuit is all about their own purposes, their own plans.

430
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 At the focal point of their plans is it's all about me,

431
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 what I want, when I want it.

432
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 And James says, "It's the type of person whose end goal

433
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 "is their own satisfaction, their own happiness,

434
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 "making more money in life, that when they think about,

435
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 "'Hey, I think I should marry her because blank,'

436
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 "in that blank is not because God described the characteristics

437
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 "that I should look for in a wife, and she has them.

438
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 "It is because she's hot."

439
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 And I'm all for it. Man, I hope you marry the hottest girl around,

440
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 beautiful ladies around you. You should ask them out.

441
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 But the point is, James is saying, they live a life where how they think,

442
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 how they act, is not operated on like, "This is what God says I should do,"

443
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 but what they want to do.

444
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Where they want to, "Hey, I think I should change jobs,

445
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 "not because God may be calling me, and I could live more on mission

446
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 "by taking that job. They think I should change jobs

447
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 "because at the end of the day, it'll just allow me to make more money."

448
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 The focal point of how they decide, how they make plans, is themselves.

449
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 If the end goal for you is to make money,

450
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 you have a miserable destination ahead.

451
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 And you're going to spend your life, that James is about to describe,

452
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 why it's a miserable destination ahead.

453
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 And you're going to waste it. Here's why.

454
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 You do not even know what will happen tomorrow.

455
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 What is your life? You're a mist that appears for a little while,

456
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 and then vanishes.

457
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 The tragic thing for so many people inside of our country and in our world,

458
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 and for years, I mean, so many guys have parents that did this.

459
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 They gave themselves to the world, and everything the world says to offer,

460
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 "Hey, the goal in life is to make as much money as possible,

461
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 "to drive the G-Wagon, to get the Tesla someday,

462
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 "get the biggest house that you can, and you're successful."

463
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And they've succeeded at everything the world says is important,

464
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 and failed at everything the Bible says actually matters.

465
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 And you can spend the rest of your life

466
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 either giving your life to collecting little pieces of paper

467
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 with dead presidents on it.

468
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 That's what money is.

469
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Or you can give your life to the only thing that actually matters,

470
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 and James would say, "Your life is like a vapor. You're really going to spend it

471
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 "building up your own kingdom and your own life, and if you do, you are wasting it."

472
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Or you can live your life and live for the will and the plans

473
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 of the one who's in control, the one who created you,

474
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 who created you for a purpose far greater than a paper collection.

475
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 But for him, and knowing him, and making him known.

476
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 I love the imagery that he uses.

477
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Because James, he puts in a perspective, and he answers the question, "What is life?"

478
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 And he answers it in several different ways.

479
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 He says, "First thing, life is brief. It's like a vapor."

480
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 What is a vapor? Vapor.

481
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 That's what James describes in his life.

482
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 He's like, "Oh, oh, oh, you're gone. Boom. Oh."

483
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 He's like, "Oh, birth, elementary school, college, oh, no,

484
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 high school, college, we got retired, married, married, lots of, no, okay."

485
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 [laughter]

486
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 And he says, "It's here and gone."

487
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 The Bible uses that illustration.

488
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Sorry, man, that's hairspray all over you guys down there.

489
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Over and over, this is the imagery that God uses.

490
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 And James says, "You need to know. You have no idea what's ahead of tomorrow.

491
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 You're not promised anything.

492
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Who are you going to live your life for?"

493
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 Let me ask a question.

494
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Who would consider themselves young in here?

495
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 There's like four people over 50 that are like, "Oh, no, they found us."

496
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 [laughter]

497
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 I'm kidding. Totally kidding.

498
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 All right, I'm getting an email for that.

499
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Here's the thing.

500
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 I mean, I'm sure all of us would.

501
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 You're like, "Hey, it's a young adult. Is this a trick question?

502
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 It's a young adult ministry?"

503
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Well, being young is kind of a relative thing.

504
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 In other words, like when you're 14, a 28-year-old is like, "Oh, you're so old."

505
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 When you're 28, a 40-year-old is like, "Man, you're old."

506
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 When you're 40 or when you're 80, a 40-year-old is young.

507
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 There's relativity to it.

508
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 But it's not just that.

509
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Young being like, "Man, I'm early on in life," is a relative thing based on when the end is.

510
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 In other words, if you're 30 and you're going to die at 32, you're in the later part of your life.

511
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 You're near the end.

512
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 You're a lot farther along than the person who's 40 who's going to die at 80, who's just halfway.

513
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Who knows the end date?

514
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 God.

515
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 James is saying, "You don't know what.

516
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 You think you're young? You think you're invincible?"

517
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Let's be honest, all of us do.

518
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 You don't know what anything holds.

519
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 You don't know when God's calling you home.

520
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 How much longer are you going to live for yourself and go, "Someday.

521
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Someday I'll get serious about God.

522
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Whenever I meet the person and we get the one, then I'll get serious about God.

523
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Then I'll start going back to church and trying to get things back in order.

524
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 But right now, I'm just trying to enjoy my 20s, trying to live my life."

525
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 He says, "You don't know if you'll have any more 20s.

526
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 You don't know how long your life will be.

527
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 You don't know how many more days that you have.

528
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 And you're going to spend that little vapor that you have

529
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 and another moment of that vapor on yourself and waste it?

530
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Are you going to give it to the only kingdom that matters

531
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 and surrender your life and use the gifts and the talents and treasures

532
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 that the world around you wants to take and take advantage of

533
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 to make money and to make rich people richer

534
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 and to collect more papers with green--

535
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 or more green pieces of paper with dead presidents on it?"

536
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 And God is saying, "All of that is like a vapor.

537
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Don't be a fool.

538
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 You don't know what tomorrow has.

539
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 You don't know what's ahead for you.

540
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 You know the one who holds tomorrow, and you can either live for him

541
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 or you can waste it."

542
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 James is saying, "When it comes to your life,

543
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 the person who makes plans or who lives as though they're in control is a fool."

544
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 He finally concludes by laying out what you prioritize.

545
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 He says this in verse 15.

546
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 "You ought to say, 'If it is the Lord's will,

547
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 we will live and do this or that.'

548
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes.

549
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 All such boasting is evil.

550
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 If anyone then knows the good that they ought to do and doesn't do it,

551
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 for them it is sin."

552
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 So he brings up the third idea, which is you might struggle with pride

553
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 if you are the priority, if your priorities are your priority.

554
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 That would be another way of saying it.

555
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 But he brings up--and he brings a verse that just kind of feels random when you read it,

556
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 but when you think about it, it makes sense.

557
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 He says, "If anyone knows the good that they ought to do today

558
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 and they don't do it, it's sin."

559
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Why would someone know the good, know what they ought to do,

560
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 know that God is calling them to some decision,

561
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 some action to take, some relationship to break off,

562
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 some conversation to have with a parent,

563
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 something they're supposed to do at work,

564
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 something they're supposed to confess to their community?

565
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Why would someone do it?

566
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Or why would someone decide, "I know what I'm supposed to do.

567
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 I'm not doing it."

568
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Well, it's probably a question you haven't thought about before,

569
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 but it's a pretty simple answer.

570
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 They don't want to.

571
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Clearly know what I'm supposed to?

572
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Not going to do that.

573
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And James says that you might know that you're prideful

574
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 if you and your priorities are your priority.

575
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Your life, your decisions, you live according to what you prioritize,

576
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 not what God prioritizes, but what you prioritize.

577
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Your priority is you and doing what you want as it relates to dating,

578
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 working, giving, spending, living.

579
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Let me ask a really important question.

580
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 When is the last time you did something?

581
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 Listen to me.

582
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 When is the last time that you did something you did not want to do,

583
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 but you did because God said to?

584
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Or a time where you wanted to do something,

585
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 but you didn't do it because God said not to?

586
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Might I suggest if you can't think of a time in your life where you're like,

587
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 "Man, I didn't want to do that, but it's what God says.

588
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 This is what I'm going to do."

589
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Your God is not the God who's there.

590
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 It's you.

591
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 The Bible over and over says there can be times where, man,

592
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 God says this is what you do,

593
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 but people who worship him as God and are surrendered to him,

594
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 they say, "Man, you drive the car.

595
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 You're in control."

596
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Is there a time where you can think of like, "Man, I was at work.

597
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 I didn't want to have this conversation about Jesus because it's just awkward,

598
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 and I don't know how I'm going to get there, but I'm a co-worker,

599
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 and I just felt like I was supposed to, and I did it."

600
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Is there a time that you can think of where maybe you're like,

601
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 "Man, I feel like I'm so busy right now.

602
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 I don't have time to get plugged into a church.

603
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 I don't know that there even is a church that I'm totally set on,

604
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 and I don't know if I want to, but I did it because God says to."

605
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Hebrews 13 says, "Submit to elders that you and I are to be a part of a local church and members."

606
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Can you think of times, moments in your life

607
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 where despite the fact that you didn't want to, you did,

608
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 or that you did want to, you didn't because God said to?

609
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 If you can't, that's confusing.

610
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 And if you're not a believer, you're not a Christian, that makes total sense.

611
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 But if you claim to be a follower of Jesus, and there aren't any times you can go like,

612
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 "Man, this is what I wanted," but it wasn't what God said to do.

613
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Maybe it's in a dating relationship where you're like, "You know,

614
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 everything inside of me is like, 'Woo! I want to push this forward,

615
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 and man, this girl. Woo! Man!'

616
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 My Bible's telling me no, but my body is telling me!"

617
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 [laughter]

618
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 What if I just go? I'm like, "Tell me, yeah!"

619
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 [laughter]

620
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 It becomes a concert, and like, "Pastor?"

621
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 [laughter]

622
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Man, I lost my total train of thought.

623
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Where everything inside of you was like, "Mm! Man, I--oof!"

624
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 [laughter]

625
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 But the Bible has made it very clear God does not want this.

626
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 If you're not living out that tension, I don't know that you're following Jesus.

627
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Because all the time, Jesus is in Luke chapter 9, "Pick up your cross.

628
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Whoever wants to be my disciple," and he uses an execution analogy,

629
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 "must pick up the gas chamber, must pick up their cross, and die daily, and follow me."

630
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 And James says, "Man, if the priority--if your life is marked by doing your priorities,

631
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 God is not your priority.

632
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 And you might know you struggle with pride if you are your priority."

633
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 James is saying over and over in this book that this new relationship,

634
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 that these new Christians have, should impact everything.

635
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 And so I was thinking about it this week.

636
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 It's like, relational proximity should determine priority.

637
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 In other words, we're talking about priority and living God's priorities,

638
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 come as a Christian.

639
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 This new relationship that I have with God and with Jesus

640
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 should impact and mark how I live all of my life.

641
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 When it comes to relationships, every relationship you have impacts your life.

642
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 But the closer your relationship is, the more it impacts your life.

643
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 Another way of saying it is the closer, the more proximity a relationship has,

644
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 the more priority it has in how you decide, how you live, the more impact it has.

645
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 An example, my wife, we got married.

646
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 We've been married 8 1/2 years, and that relationship is incredibly close,

647
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 closest one I have on earth.

648
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 That proximity determines priority.

649
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 Because she's my wife and has incredible proximity,

650
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 it determines the priority and way that I act and way that I think of

651
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 and way that I act on her behalf or for her.

652
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 In other words, when it comes to her birthday, that proximity leads to priority.

653
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 So we have birthday. We have birthday not just day.

654
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 We got birthday week because that's how she rolls.

655
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 And we celebrate because there's proximity determines priority.

656
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 I have a relationship with my barista.

657
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Don't know her that well, go in, get a cup of coffee, head on my way,

658
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 hey, thanks for the interview.

659
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 There's a relationship, but the proximity is far greater.

660
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 So when it comes to her birthday, I don't even know when it is.

661
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 I would say happy birthday if I saw her,

662
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 but there's not a proximity that determines priority.

663
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 If in your life God is not a priority and God's priorities are not your priorities,

664
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 they're not even on your radar, might I suggest there's not proximity.

665
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Closest, it's there.

666
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 And God's not angry at you. He's in love with you.

667
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 He gave his life on the cross for you. He died for you.

668
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 He wants you to experience life more than you do.

669
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 He wants a better future for you than you do.

670
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 But without proximity, of course it will not be a priority.

671
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 And James says this new relationship with God, it should impact all the ways that you think,

672
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 the way that you plan.

673
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 This is what I'm hoping to do in 2021, God, but is that what you would have me do?

674
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 As I think through who I'm going to live and how I'm going to date and even this person,

675
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 is this who God would have me date?

676
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 If I'm thinking about changing jobs, am I even considering, is this what God would want?

677
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 Or am I just directing and driving my life, giving him updates every now and then?

678
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 He's basically a 911 call.

679
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 He's not really involved. He's like the 911 police or firefighter that,

680
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 "Hey, you don't call me. I'll call you when I need you."

681
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 The Bible says that's not a relationship at all.

682
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 God wants a relationship, a relationship that the more you and I walk in proximity,

683
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 his priorities become our priorities and priorities that God has for us,

684
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 they lead to life in every different arena.

685
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 And James says, "It is prideful to think that you know better how to live the vapor of your life."

686
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 And you and I have a decision every day.

687
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Am I going to surrender it and trust him and rearrange my priorities with his?

688
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Because at the end of the day, God's not saying, "Hey, you shouldn't care about anything."

689
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 He's saying, "When it comes to what is first, a first priority,

690
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 seek first my kingdom, my righteousness, everything else will be added."

691
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 So the application for tonight is to rearrange priorities.

692
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 I don't know what your priority is, but when it comes to thinking through,

693
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 at work, my priority is to be successful and do what I just want to slay.

694
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 Is that God's priority? God's priority for me is to be a light.

695
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 Matthew 5, 14 says, "I am the light of the world."

696
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 He places lamps in specific locations to light up.

697
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 You live in a dark office where nobody else knows Jesus.

698
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 That's amazing. God put you there.

699
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 As it relates to your dating relationship, or maybe just life in general,

700
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 your priority, I want to get married, I want to have seven kids,

701
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 I want to live in his house, I want to have all these different dreams.

702
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 Is that God's priority? I don't know.

703
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 I know that his ultimate priority for all of us is to love him, to know him,

704
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 to make him known to other people.

705
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 It's not a bad thing to be married and have seven kids.

706
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 I hope you do.

707
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 [laughter]

708
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 Great, let's have seven kids. It's awesome.

709
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 But is that the priority? No, at the end of the day, it's not ultimate.

710
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 God says, "Do not put as first priority anything other than my kingdom."

711
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 And the good news is, it's Matthew 6, verse 33.

712
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 You do that, I'm going to take care of the rest.

713
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 So I was thinking about this week and this message as we conclude.

714
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 The Scriptures, they lay out something that was so sobering to me this week.

715
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 They talk about life in a way that is hard for my heart and mind to get around.

716
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 And I don't know that I ever will.

717
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 But this life is so short and then eternity, forever and ever and ever and ever.

718
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 It's like this rope, this rope represents eternity.

719
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 Creation of the world, time begins, everything created.

720
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 Thousands of years go by and someone named Jesus entered into the cosmos.

721
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 The one who created it puts on flesh and skin and he enters into it.

722
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 And Christians believe, maybe you're not a Christian, this will be helpful for you.

723
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 This is the message of Christianity.

724
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 That God in the form of Jesus came to earth.

725
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 He lived, no one denies that.

726
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 He died, no one denies that.

727
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 But then he rose again.

728
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 He came back to life.

729
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 And he claimed, and those who followed him closely, like James, claimed,

730
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 anyone who believes in Jesus, accepts Jesus as the payment for their sin on the cross,

731
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 will have eternal life.

732
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 In other words, they don't put their faith in themselves.

733
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 If I was to come down or you came down front, we had a conversation,

734
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 and I asked you on a scale of one to ten, how confident are you that you are going to spend eternity with God?

735
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 Ten being totally confident.

736
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 One, not at all confident.

737
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 And you, this happens every week, this conversation.

738
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 And people come down, ask that question, and I'm like, well, I'm like a six.

739
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 I'm like, awesome, that's a six.

740
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 Why are you a six?

741
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Sentence that comes next, almost always the same.

742
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 Starts with a single word.

743
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 I, well, I'm trying to get my life in order.

744
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 I love being back at church, but I've just done some bad things,

745
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 but I'm trying to get my life together.

746
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 Or they'll have a nine, and they're like, well, I follow God, I've done what he says,

747
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 I've saved myself from marriage, I know a lot of Bible verses.

748
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 Both of those answers, incorrect.

749
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 Eternity teaches that a person can know they have 100% confidence I will spend eternity with God in heaven,

750
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 not because I anything.

751
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 Because Jesus, what he did on the cross, paying for my sin, rising from the grave, he paid it.

752
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 I got one reason, one reason only.

753
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 No matter how good of a person I think I am, how bad I am, none of that matters.

754
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 Because the Bible says all of us are worse than we even understand.

755
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 But if you by faith say, man, I received Jesus, you died in my place.

756
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 And you rose from the grave.

757
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 You're going to live forever and ever and ever for all of eternity.

758
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 For the rest of the rest of the rest.

759
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 So that happened, and then 2,000 years go by, and then there's you.

760
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 And in the scope of eternity, because this rope goes on and on and on, it goes way off the stage.

761
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 It goes on, just imagine, forever and ever and ever.

762
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 And in that eternity, you've got this short little life of a vapor.

763
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 And the Bible says that anyone who believes in their short little life of a vapor,

764
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 in what Jesus did on the cross, they're going to spend all of that eternity with God, forever and ever and ever.

765
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 And not just that.

766
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 Anyone who uses their short little time period, where we get so focused,

767
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 where we think everything in this life is like, oh, my gosh, I can't believe that I didn't do this,

768
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 and I'm not married yet, and I'm so disappointed in this, and we get so narrowed in,

769
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 and the Bible has this picture of billions and billions of years where you're going to spend eternity with God,

770
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 and anything that you do in this life for God and his kingdom will have ripple effects for the rest of the rest of the rest.

771
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 There's a famous line that he is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to get that which he cannot lose.

772
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 That anything you invest, Jesus says, for my kingdom will be something for all of eternity and eternity.

773
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 And anything that you invest for your kingdom will just be an opportunity missed for all of eternity and eternity and eternity.

774
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 And he says to you, who are you going to live for?

775
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 Whose kingdom are you going to live for?

776
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 Are you willing to surrender, come underneath of God, and humble yourselves,

777
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 and rearrange those priorities, and trust in him in the short time period that he has?

778
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 I don't know how long God has for you. This week, I talked to a friend.

779
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 I was in my office, and a co-worker came in, and they were like, I got to go to Austin.

780
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 A friend of mine just passed away, and they rushed down. Young 20s.

781
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 Way earlier than anybody thought.

782
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 I hope God gives you many, many years with him, and that you fill those many, many years,

783
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 and even if they're 70 or 80 in the glimpse of eternity, they're even smaller than this,

784
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 and that you fill those with walking, and trusting in him.

785
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 James would say, if you do that, you will have invested it, and if not, you will have wasted it.

786
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 Let me pray.

787
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 Father, thank you that firsthand, you've given us an account from the brother of the Son of God,

788
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 the half-brother who saw his brother die and come back alive,

789
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 who experienced change and transformation in his own life when he surrendered his life to him.

790
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 I pray for anyone who tonight has never had a moment where they put their faith in Jesus.

791
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 Tonight would be their night, and they would trust in him. They would walk with him all their days.

792
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 Pray for parts of our heart, God, that are many and my own, that are filled with pride or selfishness,

793
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 that you would mercifully expose those areas.

794
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 Bend my heart more in your direction. Make us more focused on you and your kingdom,

795
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 and would you help us to walk surrendered, to walk with you,

796
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 to not give our lives to something that's so fleeting, and the voice and the messages of the world is so loud.

797
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,400
 Would you help us?

798
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,400
 We worship you now in song.
