[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   As I went down in the river to pray, Studying about the good old way,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   And who shall wear the starry crown, Good Lord, show me the way.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   O sinners, let's go down, Let's go down, don't you want to come down.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   O sinners, let's go down, Down in the river to pray.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Come on.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Man, it's good to have you here in the room or online tonight, Tuesday night.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   And it's special for me because this is my first time being here in Dallas
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   officially as a part of the porch team as the director of discipleship.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   And I'm just so honored.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   You know, my family and I about a month ago made the trek from Houston, Texas
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   to the promised land, Dallas, Texas.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   More people whooped for Houston than Dallas.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Okay.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Hey, here's a picture of my family.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   My name's Tyler, by the way.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Here's my family that's coming, I believe, here in a minute.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Oh, there they are.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   And that's my wife, Jen, and then my daughter, Emery K.,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   my son, Ty, who's holding the coconut or whatever that is,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   and then Malachi.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   We call him the Malachi Kalachi.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And, man, we're just so glad to be a part of this family.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And thank you for welcoming us in.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Thank you for those of you who are here, and thank you for those who are
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   tuning in all across the country and the Porch Live locations.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Man, we're just so glad that you're here.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Hey, one thing I want to say that I've just been -- as I've been thinking about
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   tonight, you know, sometimes I remember sitting in the seat that you're sitting
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   in, and sometimes I would wonder, hey, that guy that's up on the stage,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   is he the real deal?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Is he just playing some game, kind of manipulating people,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   and you make your judgment about me.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   But I just want to say something about the man who's typically up here,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   my friend for years, Kylan.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And I've known Kylan beyond stages.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I've seen him at high highs, and I've seen him at low lows.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I just want to say to those of you who call the porch home that the man that
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   you think Kylan is is who he is.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   This man, I have watched him weep in prayer on his face on behalf of revival
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   across our country.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   On behalf of you, he may not know your name, but he's praying and begging God
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   to move in your heart.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And I just want -- one of the reasons why I'm here is to be an adrenaline shot
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   for his ministry, to go, God is working in Kylan Perry's life,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   and it's just an honor to come alongside him.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   So can we just thank this to show honor to Kylan.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Man, thank you.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   [Applause]
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Hey, if you have a Bible, go ahead and open up your Bible to 1 Kings.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I don't know when the last time you were in 1 Kings, but we're going there tonight.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   1 Kings Chapter 19.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   No big deal if you need to use your table of contents to get there.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   1 Kings Chapter 19.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And as you're turning there, I want to tell you one of the best pieces of advice
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   that I've ever received in my life.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And that piece of advice is that all frustration in your life is rooted
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   in unmet expectation.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I'm going to say that again.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   All frustration in your life is rooted in unmet expectation.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   So I want to ask this tonight.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   As you look back on your life, has there been a season of frustration
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   that you remember living through, some of you are living through it now,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   that you can look back and say that season was marked by unmet expectation?
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   You know, I've been thinking about my life this week, and I thought about
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   back when I was in college, and I was a finance major, okay?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And I remember sitting -- yeah, finance bros in the room, come on, yeah.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   That's awesome.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Well, I remember being in class with you guys, okay?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And y'all are geeking out about assets and liabilities and P/E ratios
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   and Patagonia sweaters, you know.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And all the while, I'm getting into it, but I really started to feel this
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   passion in my heart for ministry of all things.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And I'm reading the Bible, and I'm discipling guys in my fraternity,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   and I'm going, "Oh, no.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   I think I may be called into this thing, like, for my life."
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And so I ended up kind of on a whim applying for this year-long residency
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   at a church up here in Dallas called the Village Church.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And somehow they let me in.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And so that started in August.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So I graduated in May.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   That started in August, so I had the summer, and I went and found a
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   three-month internship with student ministry with middle schoolers.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And while I'm there, just snot-nosed, middle school, running all around,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   while I'm there, the youth pastor actually leaves to go be a lead pastor
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   of a church, and that church offered me the job to be youth pastor.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   So I'm conflicted.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I'm like, "Do I take this full-time job, or do I go and be a resident
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   for a year at the Village?"
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And I remember one Tuesday night praying, "Oh, God, make it clear.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Like, what am I supposed to do?"
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Then Wednesday rolls around, and there's a middle school event.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And I'm at the middle school event, just hanging out, you know,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   handing out pizza or whatever.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And I get three wet willies in my ear from middle school kids.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   You know what wet willies are?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   You lick your finger and put it in your ear.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And after the third wet willie, I was like, "I am a finance major
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   at Texas A&M.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   I should not be getting wet willies."
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Okay.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Some of you love that.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   The majority of you hate it, okay?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   But after the third wet willie, I had made up my mind.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I'm not doing student ministry.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   That era is done.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I'm moving on to adults at the Village.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   This is going to be better.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   So I respectfully decline.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I move up to Dallas.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I start the residency.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   And pretty early on, I realize, "Oh, I'm like the bottom of the food chain here.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   I'm just doing all the behind-the-scenes work."
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   But I finally got a meeting with one of the executive staff,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   one of the big names, not Chandler, okay, but another one.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   And I finally said it for months later.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And the meeting comes the day before.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   I'm in Houston.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And it floods in Houston.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And I can't make it back to Dallas.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   So I have to message this guy, "Hey, I'm so sorry.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I can't make the meeting.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Can we postpone?"
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   He goes, "Okay."
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Sets it for a month later.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I wait a month.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   No joke.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   I'm back in Dallas.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And a hailstorm hits the night before.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And the power goes out.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And I sleep through my alarm and miss the breakfast meeting.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And I call him.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I go, "I'm so sorry.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   I'm on my way."
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   He goes, "Tyler, don't worry about it.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   We're not going to meet."
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And I find out later.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Okay, the Village Church is Matt Chandler.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   If you've heard of Chandler, I've looked up to Chandler my whole life.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   This guy goes and tells Chandler, "Tyler Moffat, that guy's a moron."
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   That's what he said.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   I found out later.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   I'm crushed, just like, "Ugh!"
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Last part of the story.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Three-fourths of the way through the residency, my boss sits me down.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   He says, "Hey, Tyler, as we've been kind of analyzing you and as we've been
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   really thinking about your gift set, we've determined that you would fit
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   better in student ministry."
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And I'm like, "Ugh!"
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   And I just remember going home.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   I'm just being honest with 2,000 of my favorite friends.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   I remember driving home.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I was frustrated.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I had all these expectations for ministry that I was going to be a part
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   of changing the world and jumping in on some big, massive revival,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   teaching big crowds, and I'm stuck with middle schoolers.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   And I remember as I was in that place, all the zeal that I had for ministry
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   just evaporated.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   I'm just being honest.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And I'm curious for you tonight, as we have this revival series,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   if you've been tracking with us, we've been talking about this kind of
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   statistics are showing that there's this quiet revival that's going through
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   our country and more and more people are returning to God.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   They're returning to Christianity, specifically among young adults.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And it's exciting.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   And you go, "Oh, this is amazing."
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   And then some of us, like me, right out of college, you look at your life
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   and you go, "That's great, but that's not what I'm feeling in my life
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   right now."
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And tonight, what we're going to do is we're going to talk about
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   specifically zeal that persists, that lasts through the mountaintop
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   and the valley.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   How do you have a passion for God, a zeal for God that goes beyond
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   just the mountaintop, camp-high moments, but even in the low part,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   you go, "I'm still red-hot in my passion for God."
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   How do you get that?
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   That's where we're going to look at.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Here's the definition of zeal as we're looking at it today.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Here's how we define it.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Zeal is an energetic pursuit and unwavering commitment to God.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   How do you get that?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   That's where we're going to look at.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Let me pray, and then we're going to dig into 1 Kings 19.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   God, we just--we really, like the songs we just sang, we really want
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   to commune with you, the God of the highlands and the God
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   of the valleys.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   God, you are not hiding from us.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   You want to reveal yourself to us, and so, God, we are asking,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   "Please come."
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Oh, God, we long for an encounter with you tonight, and maybe it's a big
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   fanfare moment of emotional excitement for you, or maybe, maybe it's the
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   still small whisper of knowing that you are real, you are good,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   and you see us and have a plan for our lives.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Oh, Jesus, we just want you.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   We long for you, and it's in your name we pray.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Amen.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   All right, 1 Kings 19, a little background.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Elijah, this is the story of Elijah, and Elijah's the prophet in the midst
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   of a godless society, and yet, Elijah's greatest goal is to see Israel
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   revived.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Like, he wants what our series has been about.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   He wants to see revival break out among his nation, and yet, there's a
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   problem.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   The king and the queen are evil, not just like a little evil, like the
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   worst evil that Israel has ever seen.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   It's Ahab, who you've maybe heard about, and he's married to his
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   beautiful wife, Jezebel, okay?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   And Jezebel says, "Hey, the national religion in Israel is now
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Baal worship."
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   And all the people just go, "Okay," and they go into Baal worship, and
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   they're all sacrificing against God.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   And so, Elijah, the first thing he does is he prays that God would cause
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   a drought on the land.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   And you go, "Why would he do that?"
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And the reason is because back in Deuteronomy chapter 28, it said,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   "There are blessings for your obedience.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   There are curses for your disobedience."
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   One of the main ones is drought.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   If the Israelites were paying attention to their Torah, to the Bible, they
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   should know, uh-oh, drought equals God is punishing us.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   We should return to him, and yet, they miss it.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   So then, in chapter 18, Elijah goes nuclear.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Then he says, "All right, here's what we're doing.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Your prophets versus Yahweh's prophet.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   450 prophets of Baal versus one prophet of Yahweh.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   We're having a showdown on Mount Carmel."
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   And the whole town shows up, and the 450 prophets of Baal are dancing
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   around their idol, trying to get their God to send down fire.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Nothing for hours.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   And Elijah's making fun of them.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   He's like, "Oh, maybe your God's using the bathroom."
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   This is in the Bible.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   He's like, "Maybe he's asleep.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Maybe if you cheer louder, he'll wake up."
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Nothing.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   And then Elijah says, "All right."
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   He puts water on his altar.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   He prays, and he says this in chapter 18, verse 36.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   He says, "Oh, Lord, let it be known to you this day that you are God in Israel
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   and that I am your servant and that they have turned their heart back to you."
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   He says, "I, more than anything else, I will have a zeal for you,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   and I want to see the return."
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   And fire comes down from heaven.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And after fire comes down, the 450 prophets of Baal are killed by the people.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   And then this is what Elijah does.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   He runs to Jezreel where the king and the queen are.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   He runs.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   He hightails it, and he says, "I want to watch this revival play out.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   It's going to be amazing."
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Because either the king and the queen are going to see this and repent,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   or the people are going to cause an uprising and kick them out.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   The status quo cannot stay the same.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   And yet look what happens in 1 Kings chapter 19, verse 1.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Look at this.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   So all that has just happened, 19, verse 1.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   "Ahab, the king, told Jezebel, the beautiful queen, all that Elijah had done
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah saying, 'Revival is breaking out.'"
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   No.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   "So may the gods do to me and more also,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   if I do not make your life as the life of one of them,"
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   one of these prophets that you killed, "by this time tomorrow.'
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Then Elijah was afraid, and he arose and ran for his life
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   and he left his servant there," verse 4.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   "But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   and came and sat down under a broom tree."
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Look at this.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   "And he asked that he might die, saying, 'It is enough.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.'"
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Okay, what's going on here?
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Elijah, all his expectations, everything that he expected God to do are unmet,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   and he's incredibly frustrated to the point where he says, "I'm done.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   I'm done being your prophet.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   I'm done trying to live some life for you.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Kill me.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   If you have any mercy, God, kill me because I'm just done.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   It's enough.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   I'm no better than anybody else," and he's just ready to die.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   And I'm curious, have you been here?
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   You know, I was just thinking, writing down some things.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   You know, maybe some of you were expecting things to end in marriage,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   and yet instead you got the text from that person that said,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   "I hope we can still stay friends," right?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   And you're going, "What?"
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Like my whole expectation was this was going somewhere.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Everything that they were communicating seemed like this was heading the right direction,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   and then you're just going to say, "Let's just be friends.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I don't want to be with you anymore."
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   What?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Some of you moved halfway across the country to Dallas or wherever
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   to be a part of a job that you're passionate about and your calling is,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   and you move here, and you're sitting in traffic on 635 in 110-degree heat going,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   "Really?
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   This is the rest of my life?
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   This is it?"
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   You know, some of you made it through that recovery program.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   It was incredibly embarrassing, incredibly difficult, but you beat it
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   only to find yourself a few months later in the same crap that you just got yourself out of.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   So you thought.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   This is very relatable.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Where Elijah is right now is where we often are in life.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   So what does God do?
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   The rest of our time together, we're just going to see with our own eyes
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   what does God do to the one who is expecting great things and is incredibly frustrated.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   And we're going to see God doesn't freak out, but he starts the work of restoring Elijah's zeal.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   In fact, God does three things.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   God does three things to restore Elijah's zeal, and the first one is this.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   First one is we see that God cares for the body as well as the soul.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   God cares for the body as well as the soul.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Let's look in 1 Kings 19, starting in verse 5.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   So all this had just happened.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   He says, "God, kill me," verse 5, "and he, Elijah, lay down and slept under a broom tree.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   And behold, an angel touched him and said, 'Arise and eat.'
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   And he ate and drank and lay down again.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   And the angel of the Lord came again a second time and touched him and said, 'Arise and eat,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   for the journey is too great for you.'
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   And he arose and ate and drank and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   to Horeb, the mount of God."
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   So notice, the first thing that God does to Elijah, his prophet saying, "Just kill me,"
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   the first thing God does is nothing.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   It's nothing.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   There's no lecture.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   There's no counseling.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   There's no therapy.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   All God does is send Dordash, angel version, okay?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   And literally the angel touches him.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   I mean, I'm just thinking of this scene, like Elijah's like, "Oh, kill me,"
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   and the angel pops up and is like, "Hey, buddy, you know, have a snack."
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Like, that's just what happens.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   And he's like, "Oh, I could use a snack."
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   And there's this weird exchange.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Angel having a snack.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   He's like, "Go to sleep, buddy.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Here's a blanket," you know?
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   And he sleeps under this tree, and we're reading this like, "Oh, yeah."
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   And then it happens again.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   The same thing.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   He wakes up.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   He's like, "Oh, where am I?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Here, have a scone," you know?
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   And here's what's so interesting.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   This is why I love the Bible.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   It's such a great book.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   The Bible realizes how human beings are made.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   God knows.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   He's intricately -- He knows how you're wired, how you're made.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   And in the moment of frustration, you're at your wits' end,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   you're at the suicidal point of depression.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   God goes, "You know what?
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   I'm not coming bringing you a lecture first.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   I'm coming bringing you a snack and some food and a nap."
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Elijah didn't need a sermon.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   He needed sleep.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   And sometimes the most spiritual thing that we can do is take a nap.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Hallelujah, somebody, right?
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Now, here's what's important.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   I'm not talking about self-care here, right?
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   We kind of live in that culture of like self-care, care about yourself,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   and that's great, but that's not what I'm talking about.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Here's the reality.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Some of you are blaming God.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   You are angry at God for the circumstances in your life when the reality is the
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   way you have wired your schedule and your habits is burning you out.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   And it's killing you.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   And God is saying, "Stop it.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Slow down.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Eat a snack.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Go to bed.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Stop doom scrolling on your phone for two hours and then waking up
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   and going, 'I don't have time to spend with you.'"
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   And you're like, "Really?"
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Maybe your habits, your lack of sleep, the way that you're exercising or not,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   all those things are feeding what's going on in you.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Martin Lloyd-Jones, who was a medical doctor before he became a pastor,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   said this.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   He said, "You cannot isolate the spiritual from the physical,
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   for we are body, mind, and spirit.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   The greatest and best Christians, when they are physically weak,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   are more prone to an attack of spiritual depression than at any other time."
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   And there are great illustrations of this in the Scriptures.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   The reality is we are body, we are mind, and we are spirit.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   And God is the creator of all things, of all three.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   We're embodied souls.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   And so we're not going to spend a ton of time on this,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   but some of you, you've lost your zeal for God.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   And you're blaming God, and you're blaming community, and you're angry.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   And the reality is your rhythms, your habits are out of whack.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   And God, like Elijah, will start in your life there.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   You know, for me, so my wife and I, three kids,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   a little different season than most of you, but at the end, we do dinner time.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   We play and wrestle, get a black eye from my 2-year-old.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Then we give them a bath.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   We put them down.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   And then my wife nurses our youngest.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   And I kind of clean the kitchen.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   If Jen's watching, I clean the kitchen.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   And I just kind of relax and turn off my brain.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   I've been doing this thing where I pull up the YouTube shorts, okay?
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   So it's not Reels.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   It's not TikTok, okay?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   But it got me.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   YouTube shorts got me.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   And it's action film scenes that I've never seen that I don't care about,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   but I'm like, "Oh," you know, and I'm watching.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Or it's random politicians yelling about things.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   I don't even know what they're yelling about, but I'm, "Oh," you know.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   And I just glued into this, and I spend an hour barely doing anything in the kitchen.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Then Jen's like, "Come on, are we going to hang out?"
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   I'm like, "Oh, yeah."
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Then I get the kitchen.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Then I'm so exhausted.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Then I wake up late, you know, because I went to bed late.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Then I'm rushing in the morning.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Then I'm getting to work.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   And it's like, wow, this has become a routine in my life.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   And I didn't even -- I wasn't, like, trying.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   It just came upon me.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   And some of you, this is happening in your life.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   I was writing down, you know, some of you -- we don't talk about this a lot,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   but maybe it's video games.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Come on.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Come on.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Some of you, you're like, "It's my community, man."
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   And you stay up until 3 a.m. with your community, man, playing video games,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   which I have nothing against, but I'm just saying you're doing that.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   And people who care about you in your life are like, "Hey, maybe that's too much."
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   And you're like, "Stop it!"
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Right?
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   And you don't let them in.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   And I'm going, God, maybe like Elijah, would go, "Hey, hey, hey,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   let's start with the video games."
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Right?
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Doesn't sound spiritual.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   You know, some of you, it's your friends, it's your girlfriends, right?
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   And they always get you with that text of like, "Hey, you want to take a sweet trip?"
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Right?
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Uh-oh, heading home.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   And you know, I already brushed my teeth, right?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   But you fall for it every time, and you're going because the memes, right?
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   And I got to lock back in, Kylan.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   But you fall for it.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   And here's all I'm saying.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   We're going to move on to the next point.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Here's what I'm saying.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Sometimes your zeal that you want to blame on God's just not present.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   The first thing, the first thing is analyzing, taking a diagnosis of your
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   life and your habits and going, "Where am I out of whack?"
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   And God wants to meet us there first.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   God cares about the body as well as the soul.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   That's the first thing.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Number two, what does God do to restore the zeal in Elijah just like he does with us?
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Number two is God offers his presence in the silence.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   So God deals with him by going after his physiology.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   But then what he does is he offers his presence in the silence.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Let's pick it up in verse 8.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   So look again at verse 8.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   We read this before, but look at it again.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   It says, "And he arose and ate and drank and went in the strength of that food
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   40 days and 40 nights to Horeb, the Mount of God.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   And there he came to a cave," take note of that, "and lodged in it."
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   He's doing a lot of sleeping.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Found a cave, he's sleeping.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   "And behold, the word of the Lord came to him and said to him, 'What are you
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   doing here, Elijah?'
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   And he said," in verse 10, he's got his speech, "I have been very jealous for the
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   Lord, the God of hosts.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   And they seek my life to take it away.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   And God said, 'Go out, get out of the cave, and stand on the mount before the
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Lord.' And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the Lord.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   But the Lord was not in the wind.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   And after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   And after the fire the sound of a low whisper.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   at the entrance of the cave."
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Do you catch what God said at the beginning?
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   So Elijah goes, he finds a cave, he goes to the cave, and God says, "What are you
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   doing here?"
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   I was just thinking about each of you tonight.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   I just wonder if God were to come to you right now in your seat here at the
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   porch, and were to say, "Hey, what are you doing here?"
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   What would you say to him?
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   I mean, I'm serious.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   What would you say to God?
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Would you say, man, if you were honest, like gut level honest, you say, "Man, I'm
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   just kind of lonely in this season of life."
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   And to be honest, to just be in a place where there are other young adults would
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   be amazing.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Some of you, if you were honest, you're like, "Man, the bar's not the best place
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   to find a lover, so the porch is where I'm at."
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   You know?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   I mean, that's where you're here.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   And some of you, if you're honest, you've got that longing, like, "Man, God, I
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   really want to meet with you."
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Like that music where you're singing, like, "I just want to."
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   But what is it?
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   See, here's the deal.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   God comes with those words to Elijah, and Elijah has his speech ready.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   And he's ticked.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   You can hear it in this.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   He goes, "Man, you want to know why I'm here?
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Because I was jealous for you," which is the Hebrew word for zealous.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   "I was passionate about you, and I went and I long-suffering loved on these
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   people and was with them, and nothing, nothing.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   I'm the only one, God, who still loves you.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Everybody else has forsaken you.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   I'm the only one left.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   You want to know why I'm here?
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   That's why."
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   And God's like, "That's cute.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   That's awesome."
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   He says, "Then think about this."
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   He goes, "You want to actually experience me?"
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Now, Elijah, he's ticked.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   He's in his cave, you know.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   "You want to experience me?"
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   He's like, "Okay," you know.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Now, here's the deal.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   He's at Mount Horeb, which you go, "Big, big deal.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   I don't know Mount Horeb."
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Mount Horeb has another name.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   It's Mount Sinai.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   This is the same mountain where Moses met God.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   And Moses goes, "God, I want to see you."
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   And God says, "You can't see me?
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Are you kidding me?
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   You'll die.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   But if you hide in this cave behind the cleft of this rock,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   you can see my back."
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   But now God's saying to Elijah, "Come out of the cave and
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   experience me."
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   And Elijah all of a sudden is going, "Oh, man.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   What even Moses couldn't do, I can do."
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   And it's the fanfare you would expect.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   A tornado rips through like DFW.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   It's just, "Whoa," you know, rolling.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   He's like, "Oh, this is God."
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   And it rolls past.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   He's like, "Man, God wasn't there."
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   And then all of a sudden an earthquake starts.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   He's like, "Oh, it's the earthquake."
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   And God's not there.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   And then fire, like he saw at Mount Carmel, begins to come.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   And God's not there.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   And then all of a sudden there's a low whisper.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   What Hebrews says is like a still silence.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   And it's in the still silence after all that's passed, God's there.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   And he wraps himself and he goes and appears before God.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   And, you know, it's interesting in light of Elijah's story, he was
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   expecting the big fanfare.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   God, if you're real, show off like you're God.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   And he saw Mount Carmel and he saw the drought.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   He was part of raising a young boy from the dead.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   And yet all of those things passed and it didn't bring revival.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   And now God's going, "Look, I work in those big things.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   I move in power."
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   When the Holy Spirit comes at Pentecost, it's a breath, it's a wind.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   When God speaks to Moses in the burning bush, it's a fire.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   And yet the normal day-to-day way that God speaks is through a gentle,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   soft whisper.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   And the question that God's asking Elijah is the question he's asking us
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   in 2025.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Are you willing to meet with me in the whisper?
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Are you willing to meet with me when the fanfare all goes away?
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   When the camp high is gone?
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   When the breakup happens?
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   When you lose the job?
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Are you willing in that place of brokenness to go, "God, you feel
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   really distant right now.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   But even in the quiet, I want you."
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   And I think, I mean, God has moved in power throughout the Bible and he's
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   moved in power throughout history in massive moves of revival.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   But I believe that if God was going to move in powerful nationwide revival
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   today, it would start in solitude.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   It would start with a group of young adults going, "This whole thing is
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   great, but what I'm most hungry for, oh, just give me some space alone
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   with God."
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   And so why do you think Satan attacks the secret place, the silent place
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   most?
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Have you ever tried to just get away alone in the quiet with God?
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Have you ever tried?
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Your mind starts racing, people start distracting you, your phone blows up.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   It's like all of a sudden your mother -- you don't have a mother-in-law,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   but your mom, you know, starts like really bugging you about all kinds of
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   things and you're like, "What, Mom?
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   I'm trying to get some alone time," right?
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   And it's because Satan's working through your mom, maybe not, but, you
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   know, but you know it's that place God's trying to attack.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Here's the reality.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   If you try to meet with God in the silence, it's hard, but God is there.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   I remember the first time that I was single before I was married, I went out
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   into the woods to put my phone away, just my Bible and a journal.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   I was like, "God, I just want you to meet with me."
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   I'm like, "Come on, silence, alone time, this is going to be amazing."
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   I remember sitting down, opening up my journal, I'm starting to write.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   I'm just looking around like, "God, you're so awesome.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Man, look at the birds and the trees.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   And why am I still single?
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   And God, what's the little joke going on with my job?"
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   And all of a sudden it just got dark, you know, like --
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   And the reality is we so often suppress what we're really feeling with noise.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   And when we do that, we miss God in the silence.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   And I have a million more things to say on this, but in Christianity today,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   we're just obsessed with hype.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   We just are.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   And I think there's some of us, there's a remnant of you in here who go,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   "Hey, I'm good with hype.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   I'm not a hater on that stuff.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   I just -- man, where's the place where I can just be alone with God?"
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   And I really believe that when that starts happening, revival will break out.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Tyler Staten says, "Prayer is a journey that starts with need,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   but it ends with relationship."
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   You start coming to God with, "I need, I need, I need,"
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   and then all of a sudden you begin to meet with God in relationship and silence.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   When you really love someone, you don't need to be talking.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   You want to, but there are times just being together is enough.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   And God goes, "Is that enough?
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Is it enough to just be with you?"
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   The first thing is God cares for the body as well as the soul.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   If you've lost your zeal, start there.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   The second is God offers his presence in the silence.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   And number three is God reveals he's working in ways we can't see.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   He's working in ways that we can't see.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Let's pick it up and read the rest.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   So let's start in the second half of verse 13.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   It says, "And behold, there came a voice to him, to Elijah,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   and he asked again, 'What are you doing here, Elijah?'
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   And Elijah said his same speech again.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   'I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   for the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   thrown down your altars, killed your prophets with the sword,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   and I, even I only am left, and they seek to take away--
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   and they seek my life to take it away.'
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   And the Lord said to him," this is interesting.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   This will go over your head if you're just reading it.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   He says, "Go, return on your way where you came from
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   to the wilderness of Damascus.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   And when you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   and Jehu, the son of Nimshi, you shall appoint to be king over Israel.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   And Elisha, the son of Shaphab of Abel-mehola,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   you shall anoint to be prophet in your place.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   And the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu put to death,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha put to death."
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Verse 18, "Yet I will leave 7,000 in Israel,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   all the knees that have not bowed to Baal,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   and every mouth that has not kissed him."
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   So God asked Elijah the same question again,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   and I've wondered, why did God do this?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Is it because he didn't understand Elijah's answer the first time?
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Is it that Elijah got the wrong--he said the wrong thing?
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   And I think it's that God's testing his heart.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Hey, did my experience--did your encounter with me in the silence change?
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   And we see it didn't. He's still stubborn.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   And so God takes a different approach this time.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   And this is what he does with us.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   If you're in a suicidal, depressed time where you're just, "I'm just done. I'm just done."
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   God doesn't come going, "Well, get up!" He starts with care.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Then he moves to an experience of his presence.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   And then he hits him with the hard truth.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   The reality is Elijah had fled south to Jezreel,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   and now God says, "No, I want you to go back to where you came from,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   and I want you to anoint a pagan king,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   and I want you to find your replacement,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   which are relatively normal things for a prophet to do."
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   So he basically says, "Hey, I want you to go back from where you came from,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   and I want you to do normal prophet things."
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   No fanfare, no credit, just what you're supposed to do.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   And it's as though God is saying, "Hey, yeah, I do the Mount Carmel thing,
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   but it's not how I normally work.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   I work and I speak in the midst of your normal life.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   I am working in ways that you can't see."
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   God is working in ways that we can't see
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   and that oftentimes it takes perspective later for us to see it.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   You know, I think back to my story at the beginning,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   and when I went to youth ministry,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   so I was transferred from adult ministry to youth ministry,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   and I was embarrassed at the beginning, and then something happened.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   As I began to love on these middle school kids, my life came back.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   You know, I began to teach the Bible,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   and they're throwing paper airplanes in the back and picking their nose,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   and I loved it, you know, and I began to disciple them and watch them grow.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   And then I got a job in grapevine as a high school pastor, and I loved it.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   And then fast forward to a few years ago.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   So I've left that job. I'm down in Houston.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   I get a call from one of my former students who says, "Hey, I'm engaged,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   and I'm about to get married to a girl who was in the youth group,"
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   and he said, "Will you officiate our wedding?"
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   I'm like, "Oh, man, that's awesome."
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   So I drive up to Dallas, and I go there for the rehearsal,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   and I see that, you know, when we do the rehearsal,
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   she's supposed to walk down with her dad,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   and she's walking down the aisle alone in the rehearsal.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   I'm like, "Hey, what's going on there?"
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   She said, "Hey, basically some things happened with my dad,
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   and he's not going to be at the wedding.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   He's kind of deserted our family in this season."
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   I was heartbroken for her.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   And afterwards, I said, I pulled her aside.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   I'm like, "Hey, no pressure, but would you be okay if I walk you down the aisle?"
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Little tears just started welling up in her eyes,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   and she just said, "I would love that."
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   The craziest thing happens, and the next day it's the day of the wedding,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   and my daughter is the flower girl, which was cute, you know,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   and we're in the back.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   The groomsmen have gone out.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   The bridesmaids have gone out, and it's just me and my flower girl daughter
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   and this bride, my former student.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   I remember looking at her.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Now and then I got tears in my eyes.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   She's got tears, and I just look at her and go, "You are so beautiful,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   and I'm so proud of you."
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   And I started walking this girl down the aisle in the church
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   where I was a youth pastor.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   And I just in that moment was so surreal,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   but it was like God was looking down, and he was just going, "See? See?"
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   So you couldn't see it.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   When you were a youth pastor just ordering another round of pizza,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   just dealing with another dramatic high schooler and all their issues,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   just dealing with another parent yelling at you about how someone --
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   What you can't see, Tyler, is one day -- stay faithful, man.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   One day you're going to be able to walk one of these girls down the aisle
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   and make her day being a father figure for her in this moment.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   You can't see it, but stay faithful, man.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   There's perspective if you keep going.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   And I just tell you, some of you, you've lost your zeal going,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   "This is pointless, and I'm going."
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   I promise you on the authority of the Bible,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   if you stay tethered to God, and you remember,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   "He's doing something I can't see,"
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   then I promise one day when perspective hits,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   either on this life or the life to come, you'll see it.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   You'll see the picture that God was weaving together
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   that right now in your young adult years you couldn't see.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   John Mark Comer says, "The truest sign of maturity
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   is finding the goodness of God in your actual life."
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   You want to know if you're mature?
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   That's how you know you're mature.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   I want to end quickly with two takeaways,
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   and we're going to fly here, and then we're done.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   Takeaway number one is, as we think about zeal,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   the first is we need a correct understanding of the gospel.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   If you want to have your zeal, your life, your passions restored,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   number one is you need a correct understanding of the gospel.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   The truth is Elijah was too optimistic
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   and too pessimistic at the same time.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   He was too optimistic.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   He thought, "God, if you send the drought,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   if you rain down fire from heaven,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   if the people see it, then revival will break out.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   I'm sure of it." He was too optimistic.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   When it didn't happen, he was depressed,
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   and he flipped over to being too pessimistic.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   That didn't work out, so then he's going, "Forget it.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   It's all done. Nothing can happen."
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   He did this emotional swing, and the reality is
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   the gospel goes after both.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   Tim Keller says, "The gospel is this.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   We are more sinful and flawed in ourselves
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   than we ever dared believe, yet at the very same time,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   we are more loved and accepted in Jesus Christ
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   than we ever dared hope."
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   At the same time, our pessimism and our over-optimism
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   is confronted with a man, a God-man,
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   hanging on a tree that's going,
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   "You are so much more broken.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   You think you're bad right now?
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Oh, I'm just so bad. You're way worse."
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   A bloody Savior on a cross declares,
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   "You're far worse than you even think you are,"
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   and yet that bloody Savior on the cross declares to you,
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   "You are far more loved than you have even the capacity
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   to understand."
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   You're way too optimistic of what you think of yourself.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   The gospel declares both, and then the second thing,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   the last thing, is that the fire of godly zeal
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   is stoked with surrender regardless of circumstance.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   This is a lot, but this is so important.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   The fire of godly zeal is stoked with surrender
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   regardless of circumstance.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Some of you refuse to see zeal for God as an option
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   because in your situation--
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   because in your mind, your situation is too dark.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   It's too hard. It's too broken.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   And until my circumstance changes,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   I cannot be passionate for God.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   And I just want to tell you it's not true.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   It's not true.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   I think we have time. One last quick story.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Man, when I was in Houston,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   I had the chance to go to a maximum security prison
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   a few times.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Not because I was the prisoner, but to visit.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   And man, as I would go, I remember the first time I went,
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   I kind of was--I went begrudging.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   I was like, "Ah, I'm a pastor. I should probably do this.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   And I got to go love on all these broken people."
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   And then I step into this chapel service
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   of life sentence guys.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   And I saw a worshiper. You thought today was cool.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   I saw a worshiper like I've never seen.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   I start hearing each of these guys' stories,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   and I'm just blown away by their willingness
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   to talk about their brokenness
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   and their ability to accurately communicate
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   the full extent of the gospel
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   and how it's changed their life.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   And yet every guy I would meet, I'd hear their story.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   It was crazy. And then they'd go,
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   "Yeah, yeah, yeah, my story's crazy,
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   but you got to hear John's story."
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   I'm like, "Okay." And then the next guy,
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   his story's crazy. He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   my story's crazy, but you got to hear John's story."
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   I'm like, "Where's John?" You know?
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   And they're like, "He's down, he's back behind
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   the sound booth running slides for chapel."
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   I'm like, "All right." So I go find him,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   and I'm like, "John, right?"
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   He's like, "Yep." I'm like,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   "I heard you have a crazy story."
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   He's like, "Oh yeah, let's go sit down."
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   And so we go sit down, and John says,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   I'm gonna tell you the abbreviated version,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   but he says, "Man, Tyler, I did a lot of things wrong
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   when I was young. 21 years old,
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   I ended up with a life sentence in this prison.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   I'm never getting out."
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   He said, "When I came here, I had a one-year-old son,
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   and I loved that son with my whole life.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   I would live just for visitation to see my little buddy."
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   He said, "In the course of years in this prison,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   I actually met God and surrendered my life to Jesus,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   and would just spend that time with my son
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   just proclaiming the gospel to him."
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   Fast forward 18 years, his son is murdered by another man.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   John's obviously heartbroken.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   And through COVID, this happened pre-COVID,
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   in the midst of COVID, there was a shakeup of the prison,
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   and the man who killed John's son ended up at his prison.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   And not only that, this man ended up in his cell block.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   And so John knows who this guy is.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   This guy doesn't know who John is.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   And all the guys in the cell block go,
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   "Bro, we'll get you alone so you can kill him."
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   John's telling me this, I'm like, "What?
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   That's a crazy story, right?"
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   And he goes, "Man, I remember I went up
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   and I talked to this man who killed my son,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   and I said, I just started asking him questions,
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   just kind of interview, you know, just like getting after him."
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   And the guy finally goes, "Man, who are you?"
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   And John goes, "Man, my name's John. You murdered my son."
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   And the guy, little scrawny guy, goes in the corner,
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   he's like, "Man, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   I didn't mean to all get transferred out."
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   And John goes, "Hey, me and you are talking tomorrow."
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   And John goes into his cell block, into his cell,
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   and he gets on his face alone in the silence before God
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   and pours out his heart to God.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   This is a broken man with a past
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   who surrendered his life to Jesus
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   on the floor of a dirty prison cell.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   God, everything in me wants to kill this man.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   Everything in me from a justice standpoint thinks it's right.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   Even my buddies in the prison, what are they going to do?
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   Throw me in prison if I kill him?
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   Like, this is what I'm going to do.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   He's just confronted with the God who forgave him.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   And as he's there, it's just God gently following this path,
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   cared for him, met with him, spoke to him.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   And as he spoke to him, it was a reminder of,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   "John, right now in the midst of where you're at,
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   I forgave you way more than what you even realize.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   You can forgive this man."
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   And, "John, you must forgive this man,
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   or you will be the one who dies.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   You'll be the one spending the rest of your life
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   living in that vengeance.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   You must forgive."
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   Next day, John goes and meets with this man.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   He says, "I'm not going to kill you.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   I'm going to tell you about someone who changed my life."
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   And he shares the gospel with this man.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   This man's hardened, so John comes back the next day
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   and the next day and the next day.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   And after a matter of weeks, finally, that hard shell breaks.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   And this man, he surrenders his life to Jesus,
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   receives forgiveness, not only from John, but from God.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   And then over the next year, John discipled this man.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   Think about this.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   And then a year later, they transferred this man
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   out of the prison, and John's telling me now in tears,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   he said, "When they transferred him out,
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   it was like I was losing my own son."
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   Now, I'm losing it right here in this story.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   I'm like, "What?"
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   You know, and he's losing it.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   And here's why I wanted to end with that.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   I know some of you.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   Some of you, you're at the porch, you're just excited.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   This is great.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   Some of you, though, you are walking through dark, dark, dark seasons,
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   and you're thinking, "There's no way.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   There is no possible way I can walk with God
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   in the midst of this season and have zeal and passion for him."
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   And I'm going, "I know.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   On your own strength, absolutely not.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   But with the God who worked in a dirty prison cell in John's life,
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   he can work in yours.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   Don't wait for your circumstance to change.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   Surrender to a God who meets us in the still silence
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   right where you're at."
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   And that can happen right now, right now.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Let's pray.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   Father, more than anything else,
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   we long to encounter the still small voice.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   Yes, we want the fanfare.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   Yes, we want the hype at times.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   But there's a generation, a remnant of young adults
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   who we've seen that show.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   We're not angry about it.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   There's got to be something more, and there is.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   Lord, I just pray tonight, I'm feeling this tug,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   that there's some people here who have never had that dirty cell room,
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   prison cell floor moment of surrender to Jesus.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   Lord, I pray today is that day.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   No circumstance change.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   The darkness is still there.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   The silence still feels quiet.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   And yet, I need that.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   I need that.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   Lord, I pray that the gospel would ring out
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   that God loved us far more than we can imagine,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   despite us being far worse than we even know.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   And Lord, would your spirit meet us right now?
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   Would we see Jesus and surrender fully to him?
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   Some tonight would go, "I'm in. I am all in for that."
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   And they would just say simply, "Father, I receive your grace.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   I confess that I'm in such darkness right now, and I need you.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   Jesus, come. Be my sacrifice. Be my everything."
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   Even in the still, small voice.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   I love you, and I trust you.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Now we pray all this in Jesus' name.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Amen.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   Amen.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.060]   you
