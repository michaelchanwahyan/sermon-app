[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.200]   - All right, all right, let's do it.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.340]   Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.080]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.600]   If we haven't met, my name is JD.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.400]   I'm the creative director here on Tuesday nights.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.400]   It's an honor to be here.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.440]   We're gonna jump right in.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.600]   I wanna say what's up first
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.960]   to our Porch Live locations tonight.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.280]   Say hello to Porch Live North Houston,
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.880]   Porch Live Scottsdale, Tulsa, and Midland.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.920]   Let's give them a hello from Dallas, Texas.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.960]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.480]   So glad you guys are tuning in.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.920]   Wherever you're watching online,
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.040]   you are welcome here tonight.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.200]   I wanna go and give a preview of where we're heading tonight.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.020]   We are in between series.
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.160]   We just finished RIP to the old me.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.780]   Next week, we have something really exciting in store.
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.840]   Stay tuned.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.520]   And tonight, we're gonna look at a story
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.480]   that I think a lot of us are familiar with
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.800]   and when I was praying about where
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.800]   the kind of God wanted to take us tonight,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.740]   there was a quote that I used the last time I spoke
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.940]   from A.W. Tozer, and he said,
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.160]   "Your view of God determines your response to him."
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.240]   Your view of God determines your response to him.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.120]   And it seemed to resonate with a lot of people.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.220]   And so I thought tonight,
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.400]   I'd take us further on what that looks like.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.940]   And we're gonna do that through this story
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.320]   in Luke chapter 15.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.640]   And so if you go ahead and turn there,
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.000]   I'm gonna just read the story for us tonight.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.240]   And then after that, we're gonna pray and get right in.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.080]   Luke chapter 15 set the scene.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.000]   Jesus is sitting in verse one, we see this.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.440]   He says, "Now the tax collectors and sinners
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.160]   were all drawing near to him," him being Jesus.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.680]   "And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled,
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.000]   saying, 'This man receives sinners and eats with them.'"
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.160]   That's the setting that we're sitting in.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.920]   And clearly what Jesus is about to show us here
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.640]   is there are people in his midst
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.620]   who had a wrong view of what he was about,
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.840]   had a wrong view of what his father was about
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.200]   and the people that he wanted to reach and to save,
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.960]   the people that he wanted to draw near to.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.280]   There were people in his midst who were grumbling
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.440]   and complaining and distant from Jesus
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.760]   because they did not know what he was about,
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.040]   what his actual heart was for people.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.040]   And so Jesus takes this moment
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.520]   where he's gonna share this story
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.360]   that resonates with every single person
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.920]   in this room tonight.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.320]   And he reads this story because we know
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.600]   that scripture tells us that Jesus was fully God
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.440]   and fully man.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.320]   And I don't know right now what has dictated your view
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.640]   of God and the church up into this point.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.220]   I don't know what experience has brought you
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.800]   to how you currently view him, but there is no one,
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.400]   no one who has ever walked the earth
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.660]   who knows more of how to have the right view of God
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.920]   than Jesus.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.960]   And so if you wanna have the right view of him,
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.000]   this is the story 'cause he's gonna tell you,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.920]   hey, this is the heart of God.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.420]   Chapter 15, verse 11.
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.140]   Here's how he describes the heart of God.
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.480]   He parallels it to a young man and his father.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.680]   Verse 11, and he said,
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.200]   "There was a man who had two sons
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.800]   "and the younger of them said to his father,
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.340]   "Father, give me the share of property
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.680]   "that is coming to me.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.080]   "And he divided his property between them.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.640]   "Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.720]   "and took a journey into a far country.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.940]   "And there he squandered his property in reckless living.
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.640]   "And when he has spent everything,
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.960]   "a severe famine arose in that country
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.380]   "and he began to be in need.
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.240]   "So he went and hired himself out
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.440]   "to the one of the citizens of that country
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.460]   "who sent him into the fields to feed pigs.
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.360]   "And he was longing to be fed with the pods
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.380]   "that the pigs ate and no one gave him anything.
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.100]   "But when he came to himself,
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.000]   "he said, how many of my father's hired servants
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.580]   "have more than enough bread,
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.040]   "but I perish here with hunger.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.780]   "I will arise and go to my father
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.700]   "and I will say to him,
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.940]   "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.000]   "I am no longer worthy to be called your son.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.940]   "Treat me as one of your hired servants.
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.800]   "And he arose and came to his father.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.720]   "But while he was still a long ways off,
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.160]   "his father saw him and felt compassion.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.620]   "And he ran and embraced him and kissed him.
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.580]   "And the son said to him,
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.040]   "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.320]   "I'm no longer worthy to be called your son.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.960]   "But the father said to his servants,
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.260]   "bring quickly the best robe, put it on him,
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.320]   "put the ring on his hand, the shoes on his feet
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.080]   "and bring the fattened calf and kill it
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.140]   "and let us eat and celebrate.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.080]   "For this my son was dead and is alive again.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.960]   "He was lost and is found.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.640]   "And they began to celebrate."
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.080]   God, this is your heart for your people.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.420]   If there's someone here tonight,
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.960]   I don't know what it is, but whatever it is,
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.200]   they're angry with you, they're mad at you,
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.600]   they're distant from you.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.200]   They think that you're irrelevant or you're some myth.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.500]   And they're here for any other reason other than you
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.040]   because they don't truly have the right view of you.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.360]   Would you open up their eyes tonight?
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.640]   Holy Spirit, would you come and speak through me right now?
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.560]   If there's anything that JD wants to say, take it away.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.120]   Take it away, would you come and move?
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.400]   We open up our hearts to you in this time.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.440]   We wanna know your heart, God, and respond accordingly.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.040]   In your name that we pray, amen.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.740]   Well, my junior year or sophomore year of college,
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.580]   I can't remember.
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.240]   Me and my friends did this thing one Friday night
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.480]   where we brought over all our friends,
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.080]   we took all the mattresses out of all of our room,
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.120]   we put them in the living room,
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.600]   and we had a scary movie night.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.100]   The scariest movie, I think,
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.620]   I stopped watching scary movies after this
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.260]   because it petrified me, was "Strangers."
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.560]   In this movie, the premise,
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.840]   it starts off with this statistic,
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.960]   I don't remember exactly what it said,
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.760]   but it says something along the lines of,
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.200]   "Hey, every year in America,
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.120]   this many random murders happen for no reason."
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.240]   And I'm like, that's great.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.760]   And then the movie goes on and there's this married couple,
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.240]   they like, their car breaks down,
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.840]   they find themselves in this like Airbnb, I guess,
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.800]   and throughout the night,
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.440]   they're just getting tortured by this group of people.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.160]   It's a great start of the message.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.520]   So at the end, the husband's dead, we're led to believe,
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.040]   and then the wife is like crawling backwards,
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.800]   and you're watching the girl in the bunny mask
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.480]   like drag the knife or ax or whatever,
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.480]   and then she like flips her over and she's like,
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.300]   "Why are you doing this?"
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.960]   And she gets down and she's like,
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.260]   because you were home.
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.320]   That was it.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.500]   And it like ends.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.040]   And you're like, wait, hold up.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.620]   People are out here killing people for simply being at home.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.680]   Like they don't need a reason.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.280]   Hide your kids, hide your wife, nobody's safe.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.280]   And so I don't go back to my room.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.280]   I don't wanna be alone.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.400]   So I fall asleep on the couch.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.040]   So everyone leaves, all three of my roommates
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.880]   were football players, so they had a game the next morning.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.920]   They're out the door.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.840]   And I wake up to this eerie feeling
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.920]   that like I knew I wasn't alone.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.520]   Like I knew.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.740]   Be it the movie the night before, I don't know,
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.560]   but I just understood that there was someone with me.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.300]   And you know when the blinds aren't pulled up,
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.860]   but they're like open?
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.600]   I like raised up and I'm like looking in my backyard.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.640]   It was like fenced in where like you can't come in
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.480]   if you're not invited.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.300]   You don't just get to like be like,
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.380]   "Oh, I'm in your backyard."
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.680]   It was a very private backyard.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.080]   And there's this man, I would say late forties, early fifties
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.900]   with a beard and like the like zip up,
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.060]   like mechanic things walking around.
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.900]   And I'm like,
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.240]   I grabbed my bat, I head to the back door and I'm like,
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.180]   "Yo, I'm just kidding."
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.820]   I ran to the back closet.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.300]   And so I run to the farthest room,
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.060]   I go inside and I get inside the closet.
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.700]   And it's like one of those like rectangular closets
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.780]   with like the trifold doors, like the old house,
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.820]   you know what I'm talking about.
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.980]   And so I get in there, I get behind the clothes
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.740]   and all of a sudden the back door.
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:05.280]   And I hear, "Is anyone home?
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.180]   Why'd the girl last night die?
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.480]   Because she was home."
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.260]   So I'm like, "Take whatever you want,
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.340]   but your brother ain't home.
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.380]   Like come and do what you want
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.100]   'cause you ain't killing me today, no sir."
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.540]   And so I am dead quiet.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.840]   And I'm like, "He's gonna just steal the TV and leave,
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.940]   like it's fine."
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.420]   So I'm sitting there, knees weak, arms are heavy,
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.260]   I'm down like this.
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.180]   And I kind of look like I think like when I picture myself
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.300]   as like Smeagol, like, you know, like.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.660]   And so I'm sitting there and he comes walking back
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.340]   down the hall and I'm like,
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.200]   "Okay, he has no business back here.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.700]   Like what's he doing back here?"
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.700]   Out of all four doors, the one I'm in.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.140]   At this point I'm like,
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.980]   "Anyone home?"
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:56.340]   'Cause there's no way he's gonna look inside the closet.
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.540]   Who is this man, right?
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.220]   I look up, hands grab the clothes,
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.940]   pull them back.
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.940]   "Son of a."
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.540]   I won't fill in what he said after that.
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.720]   If I don't see him, he can't see me.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.760]   So I keep my head down.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.280]   The awkward tension is so thick in the room.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.520]   I'm like in my boxers, I'll say it, you know.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.800]   And I'm probably covered in sweat.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.040]   I mean, I look like the epitome of demon possessed.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.640]   And I'm sitting there and this man's like, "Oh."
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.680]   And I hear like clank, clank, clank, clank,
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.060]   footsteps out, door slams, car runs off.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:37.760]   I fall out and I look at my phone and my roommate's like,
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.760]   "Hey, heads up, the landlord is sending over the electrician."
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.720]   And it's an old house and I'm not kidding.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.180]   Out of everywhere to hide in this dang house,
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.360]   I hid underneath the breaker box.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.080]   And I like to think that right now
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.060]   he's in front of a thousand people being like,
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.520]   "So here's the day I met a demon possessed guy."
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.440]   And I start there because
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.620]   I clearly had a wrong view of this man.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:12.700]   Like he was there to help me, a kind man.
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.300]   And I was like, "You're here to kill me.
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.100]   You're here to hurt me."
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.100]   And my response showed accordingly.
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.780]   I ran from him.
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.420]   I did not come to him because I viewed him improperly.
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.620]   How you view someone determines your response to them.
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.780]   So it's really important.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.440]   It's really important that when we talk about God,
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.320]   the one that we say here as the church
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.000]   is the author and giver of life,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.040]   the one that you should surrender your all to,
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.500]   it's really important that you take time
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.420]   being around the right people,
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.340]   reading his word and being informed
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.600]   to have the right view of who he truly is.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.560]   Because if you don't,
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.400]   you will find yourself wasting your life.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.900]   Because you're gonna spend your days
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.500]   running from a God who is there.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.360]   He's always been there to help and love you.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.800]   But because of your improper view,
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.880]   you chose your own path
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.760]   because you thought he was there to hurt you.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.200]   And we see in this story that clearly this son
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.560]   in the same way he ran from his father
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.880]   because he had a false view,
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.800]   an incorrect view of who he was.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.280]   So we're gonna look at this story and see two false views.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.080]   Two false views of God that we have
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.200]   that determine a wrong response to him.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.740]   And hopefully that when we look to this
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.040]   and we learn about what God,
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.040]   what Jesus is trying to say
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.880]   is actually true of our father God,
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.320]   it will change our view,
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.800]   therefore change everything
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.120]   about how we respond to him with our lives.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.460]   So false view number one.
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:46.220]   A false view number one is God the withholder.
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.560]   God the withholder.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.480]   This son clearly thought that his father,
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.520]   his intent was to withhold fun,
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:01.520]   passion, pleasure and success from him by his actions.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.380]   Verse 11, he said, "There was a man who had two sons
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.340]   and the younger of them said to his father,
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.060]   'Father, give me the share of property
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.260]   that is coming to me.'
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.700]   And he divided his property between them.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.660]   'Father, give me my share that is coming to me.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.100]   I know dad that you have some plan for my life
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.620]   or you're accumulating some inheritance to give me.
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.340]   And I know like, if you think about it,
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.740]   this dad had everything.
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.540]   We're seeing here that there was a wealth in this family,
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.260]   that they lived in a nice place.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.500]   He had food, he had hired servants,
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.100]   he had clothes on his back.
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.780]   He had everything that he could ever need.
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:39.140]   Yet because he thought that life was green
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:39.980]   on the other side,
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.460]   because he thought his father was there
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.820]   to withhold from him,
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.500]   he said, "I wanna take hold of my own life.
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.820]   Give it to me now."
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.980]   This looks like a lot of us today.
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.380]   God, man, he kind of seems like a fun sucker.
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.580]   Like my friends that don't follow Jesus,
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.180]   they're out living it up every weekend.
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.740]   They get to spend their money how they want.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.460]   They get to dress how they want,
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.260]   post how they want,
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.940]   hook up when they want and with who they want.
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.800]   They get to play house with their significant other.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.800]   They seem to have no guilt about it.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.740]   God must be no fun.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:19.760]   He must be a fun sucker.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.340]   He must be withholding from me.
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.500]   And like this son, we say,
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.380]   "Okay, then I'm gonna take what's mine
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.620]   and make a plan for my own life.
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.540]   I'm gonna go make my own fun.
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.860]   I'm gonna go spend it all on reckless living.
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:39.180]   The nice apartment, the nice clothes,
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.740]   the job to get that relationship
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.580]   with that hot guy or that hot girl."
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.340]   Girls, a lot of the ways that this looks like for you
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:51.060]   is, well, God, you're clearly withholding from me
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.700]   because I've been praying for a spouse for three years
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.000]   and I'm still single.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.780]   God, you said if I went into a relationship with you,
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.380]   you would give me the desires of my heart.
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.960]   Well, hello, my desires want that man over there
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.480]   and he won't even ask me on a date.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.400]   So what do you do?
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.620]   You take control.
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.760]   And the problem is, is when we start to think God
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.020]   as a God who withholds your best life now,
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.820]   when you start to doubt the heart of God,
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.500]   you will start to trust your own heart.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.720]   And there's a lot of things
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.580]   that that will result in in your life
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.500]   because the problem with trusting your own heart
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.140]   is Jeremiah 17, nine says,
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.940]   "The heart is deceitful above all things.
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.700]   It's desperately sick.
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.540]   Who can understand it?
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.420]   You left to you are a mess."
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.020]   And Jesus is showing us that here.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:45.220]   Yeah, sure, for a moment, this guy experienced fun.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.740]   Yeah, for a moment, this guy had some money.
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.700]   Yeah, for a moment, this guy experienced the party life
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.580]   and the pleasure, but left to himself,
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.180]   where did it take him?
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.260]   Where did he end up?
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.620]   This is what thinking that you can take control
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.020]   and when you think, oh, God withholds
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.660]   so I should take hold of my plan for my life,
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.380]   you start to play God, things get really, really bad.
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.980]   A couple of ways that looks like that you can just go,
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:16.280]   man, is my response to God to take control of my own life?
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:21.280]   Well, are you someone that obsesses over your plans?
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.940]   Like you're like, man,
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.780]   here's exactly how I want this to go.
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:29.620]   Get the degree, get the job, get the girl or get the guy,
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.180]   have the kids, get the house, get the 401k,
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.300]   go on the vacations, get the car,
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.700]   do all these different things, what I want, when I want.
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.940]   And if anything, if God wants to take any of this from me,
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.940]   I'll show him, I'll double down on my work.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:49.140]   I'll double down on my fun living because this is my life.
[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.800]   I wanna live my best life now.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:56.020]   So many of us, whether we realize it or not, want control.
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.220]   But to think that you have control over anything
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.640]   in this world is to be in a state of delusion.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:08.900]   COVID, actually this week I saw, this week, two years ago,
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.000]   sorry for the PTSD of the trigger,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.520]   like this week, two years ago, we couldn't be here anymore.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.160]   This was the week.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160]   That's crazy when you think about it.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.300]   But that showed all of us really quickly,
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.200]   man, our plans, nothing.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.160]   There's nothing.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.040]   So why would I want to put all my trust into my plan
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.720]   when it can so quickly change?
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.640]   This guy left and things were going according to his plan.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.200]   And then look what happens.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.520]   It says a famine came into the land.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.760]   Hey, he might can control where he spends his money
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.400]   or how he gets it, but he can't control the weather.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.260]   He can't control a famine.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.840]   He can't manifest it either.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.960]   And I wanna quickly just talk about this trend I'm seeing
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.520]   where a lot of people think that they can manifest
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.180]   what they want in their life.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.300]   There's this thing about manifestation
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.460]   that I'm telling you you're being deceived
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.580]   because no matter how much you name it and claim it,
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.740]   no matter how much you say, I will have success,
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.540]   I will have a pay raise, I will get that car,
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.180]   I will have that significant other,
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.280]   I will have only positive vibes and positive energy.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:24.800]   The Bible says, in this world, you will have trouble.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.260]   Not if you will, because we're a fallen world.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.280]   And so for you to think,
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.740]   man, it's up to me to manifest my day.
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.900]   It's up to me to manifest my joy.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.540]   It's up to me to manifest who I let in.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.580]   No, because if you think that you can manifest
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.140]   what you want, why did you not manifest COVID away?
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.980]   I mean, just help a brother out.
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.900]   If it works, if your manifestation board works,
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.500]   you could have put COVID-19 on there for us,
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.700]   but you can't.
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.040]   And to think that you have control,
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.180]   it's a state of delusion, none of us do.
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.780]   The Bible says in James chapter one, verse 17,
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.780]   that every good and perfect gift is from above,
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.300]   coming down from the father of the heavenly lights,
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:16.300]   who does not change like shifting shadows.
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.260]   That's so important that you understand
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.060]   the reason why we make terrible gods
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.840]   is 'cause we are changing.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.620]   Life around us is changing, circumstances change,
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:30.020]   which proves that only God is truly trustworthy
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:34.100]   because he is the only one who never changes, ever.
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.860]   He is consistent.
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:40.020]   His character is the only thing truly dependable.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.940]   What I see here is his view of his father, this son,
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.100]   was that he couldn't trust him.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.060]   And like a lot of us,
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.900]   when you try to get control of your life,
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.060]   what I think that you are saying with that action
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.760]   is I cannot trust you, God, so I'm gonna trust myself.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.020]   How's that going for you?
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.600]   I know for me, when I try to take matters into my own hands,
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.220]   it only makes me more anxious
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.880]   'cause I realize just how much I can't control things.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.780]   You only get more depressed.
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.860]   You only get more worried and stressed out.
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.520]   And so the response here to God should be,
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.220]   God, I trust you, that if you dress the lilies,
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.980]   if you provide the home for the sparrows,
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.140]   how much more will you clothe me
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.020]   and love me and provide for me?
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.900]   And God is looking for people.
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.640]   He's looking to trust people with great things
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.820]   for those who put great trust in him.
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:36.500]   He's looking for people who have faith in his plans
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.820]   and say, God, this doesn't look like I thought it would.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.980]   God, I didn't think I'd be 28 and single.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.580]   God, I didn't think that I would lose my job in 2020
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.960]   and nothing ever be the same since.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.460]   I didn't think I'd be working from home
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.800]   and experiencing such loneliness, but I trust you.
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.540]   Despite what I feel, despite what I see, I trust you.
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.440]   And watch what he will do with that trust.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.880]   Because if your view of God
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.000]   is that he truly is not withholding,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.960]   but he does want to give you life and life to the full,
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.060]   it will change your response to him.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.880]   You'll run into hard circumstances
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.500]   because you're not operating in fear, but faith.
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.840]   You'll climb that next height
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.060]   or you'll step into that new situation.
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.160]   You'll go on that trip to Ethiopia
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.120]   because you're like, I trust you.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.560]   I'll do what you want.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.980]   I'll leave the job.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.540]   I'll make the change.
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.780]   I'll have the breakup.
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.500]   Whatever you want, I trust you
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.000]   'cause I don't believe you're withholding from me.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.380]   I believe that you only want to give me good things,
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.740]   that you know what I need before I even ask,
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:44.880]   like your word says.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.380]   But this man, his view of God is that he's a withholder,
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.620]   that he's untrustworthy.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.560]   So his response was to run.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.480]   What's crazy, it says,
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.620]   he spent it all on reckless living, verse 14.
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:59.500]   When he had spent everything,
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.060]   a severe famine arose in that country
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.480]   and he began to be in need.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.140]   So he went and hired himself out
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.100]   to one of the citizens of that country
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.260]   who sent him into the fields to feed pigs.
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.180]   And he was longing to be fed with the pies that the pigs ate
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.580]   and no one gave him anything.
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.820]   There's a quote we say a lot around here
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.220]   is that sin will take you further
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.580]   than you ever wanted to go.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.600]   It'll keep you longer than you ever wanted to stay
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.360]   and it will cost you more than you ever wanted to pay.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.020]   This man had his best life plan now.
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.540]   I see so many people who don't know God
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.620]   posting about, man, me living my best life.
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.580]   You cannot live your best life apart from Jesus.
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.600]   You can't, you can't.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.580]   I'm telling you right now,
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.720]   you think that's your best life?
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.220]   No, you're sacrificing good or great for good.
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.940]   That's what you're doing.
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.880]   'Cause the only life to the full,
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:51.080]   the only life in abundance is with Jesus.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.000]   And this man shows us what Jesus is saying here
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.240]   is so many of us are forsaking the palace
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.200]   to sleep with the pigs.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.960]   We have found ourself leaving all that God has had for us
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.680]   for some pigs, for people who don't wanna make you better,
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.560]   for people who want to see you fail,
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.760]   for people who want you to be miserable like they are.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.720]   They want that for you.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.980]   You know who wants that more than them?
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.160]   The enemy.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.560]   He wants to see your life destroyed.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.840]   And so he's gonna convince you that,
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.800]   yeah, take your own life, take your own plan of action.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.680]   You got this, you do you, boo.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.160]   You form your own truth.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.560]   You love who you wanna love.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.580]   You live how you wanna live.
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:28.960]   There's no absolute truth.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.200]   God's word isn't good.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.320]   It contradicts your life.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.280]   You do you.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.040]   And now you found yourself further
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.440]   than you ever wanted to go.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.760]   And you've left the palace, the abundant life
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.760]   for some pigs, for your sin.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.800]   And I'm here to tell you
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.840]   that if you would change your view of God,
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.640]   if you would trust him with your life and go,
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.120]   God, even when it feels like
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.480]   you're withholding something from me,
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.840]   I'm choosing to hold on to what is true.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.620]   And I'm choosing to hold on to you, Jesus.
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.440]   It will change everything about how you respond
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.160]   to him with your life.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.140]   And that is when you'll experience your best life now.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.680]   The next thing we see here,
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.800]   false view number two is God the angry judge.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.320]   It says in verse 17,
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.200]   "But when he came to himself,"
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.880]   some of you tonight,
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.580]   the only thing that you need to understand
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:19.980]   is this moment for this man.
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:24.680]   He's laying there with pigs, covered in mud,
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.440]   and he's asking to be fed pig slop.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.880]   And then he remembers his life with his dad.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.960]   And he just has this aha moment
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.680]   where it's like scales fall off his eyes.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.440]   And he's like, man, what am I doing?
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.960]   And he came to his senses.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.660]   He let go of his pride.
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:52.360]   And he saw his father and he remembered.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.240]   And he came to his senses.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.040]   Some of you tonight,
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.760]   you need to simply wake up.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.960]   You need to realize,
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.440]   you need to look at your circumstances.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.720]   Remember how your parents raised you.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.480]   Some of you, your parents miss you.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.020]   Your parents miss you.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.800]   You're not who they raised you to be, and you know it.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.400]   And you need to come to your senses.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.760]   Some of you, your God misses you.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.600]   And he sees you.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.160]   He remembers when you were 12,
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.280]   when you made that decision to give him your life.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.680]   And then that thing happened to you
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.000]   that led to you making a decision
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.420]   and running and running and running.
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.040]   And he's asking you, he's begging you tonight,
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.840]   come to your senses, come back home.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.340]   He says, he came to himself and he said,
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.960]   "How many of my father's hired servants
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.940]   "have more than enough bread,
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.360]   "but I perish here with hunger.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.600]   "I will arise and go to my father.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.440]   "And I will say to him,
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.820]   "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.980]   "I am no longer worthy to be called your son.
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:50.040]   "Treat me as one of your hired servants."
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.360]   His false view here is he still saw something wrong
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.160]   with his father.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.440]   Because something in him believed,
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.840]   because of his actions,
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.040]   he had a conditional love with his father.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.880]   Therefore, hey, you know, my dad,
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.200]   there's no way because of what I did
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.320]   that he'll take me back as his son.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.280]   So maybe he'll take me back as a slave.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.920]   A lot of us are there.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.100]   A lot of Christians are there.
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.160]   Where you stepped into a relationship with God,
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.760]   you've acknowledged him as your father.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.260]   You're saying, I am your son and your daughter.
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:22.920]   But because of your actions, you're living like a slave.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.080]   Here's what this looks like.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.040]   God invites every single one of us to feast
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.640]   and experience, like I said, life and life to the full.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.400]   He wants you to sit down and he wants you to taste
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.880]   and see how good he is
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.520]   and experience all of this stuff,
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.760]   to drink and have fun and be married
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.400]   and experience a life with him.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.840]   He wants to simply be with you.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.040]   We create this place because we believe that God wants to be
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.500]   with every single one of you.
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.960]   However, because of your 12-year porn addiction,
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.760]   because you're living with your significant other
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.920]   and y'all are hooking up all the time
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.420]   and you know that's not God's best,
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:00.400]   we tell you that all the time
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.120]   and you still choose your pleasure
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.520]   and your passions over your God.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.240]   Because of your pride and your gossip
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.040]   and because of your bitterness and your anger,
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.240]   because of the thing that happened to you
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.740]   that's made you distant from God.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.720]   Yeah, you come here, but you only do it
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.880]   because you believe that God still wants you to do something.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.600]   So you're going, what you're communicating is,
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.920]   God, I can't come here and be free
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.800]   and lift my hands and eat and dine
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.120]   and sit at the feast with you.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.720]   I'll come here and I'll serve you.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.600]   I'll do things, I'll prepare a table.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.640]   I'll do all this stuff.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.480]   And God is saying, sit.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.080]   I want you to be with me.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:33.980]   I love you.
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.900]   But so many of us, we come in here.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.100]   I'll see how this goes.
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:45.700]   We come in here and this is how we operate with God.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.740]   I'll try, I'll try.
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.980]   Let me, we come in here
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.420]   and our hearts are worshiping like this.
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.300]   Yeah, we're lifting hands
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.460]   'cause we think God wants us to serve him,
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.700]   but this is how they are.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:02.660]   We fold our hands in prayer, but this is how we look.
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.500]   Because something in you still believes,
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.820]   God, I'll come back home.
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:13.100]   I'll come to church, but you just want me as a slave.
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.300]   You don't want me as a son because you're an angry judge.
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.380]   That's your view of God.
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.540]   I don't know what dictated that view for you.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.460]   I don't know what formed that view of God for you.
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.660]   Maybe it's because you've only had angry judges
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.180]   in your life.
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:29.160]   Maybe it's because you've only experienced conditional love
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.740]   that when you did something bad, you got bad.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.340]   Maybe it's 'cause your parents divorced, conditional.
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.580]   Maybe 'cause your dad left.
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.260]   Well, if he can leave, how do I know God won't bounce?
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.180]   Maybe it's 'cause that person cheated on you
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.940]   when they said they loved you and you were in game.
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.980]   Something formed a view that you have projected onto God
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.100]   for far too long and you still believe
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.180]   that he's an angry judge, but the Bible says,
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.940]   "There is now therefore no condemnation
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.820]   "for those who are in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.260]   And I had to believe that this was Jesus' favorite part
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.780]   of the story because in John, in John, read this.
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.500]   Jesus says, John chapter eight,
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.220]   Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.200]   "Everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.120]   "A slave is not a permanent member of the family,
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.980]   "but a son is a part of the family forever.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:20.480]   "So if the son sets you free, you are truly free."
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.660]   Who was the son of God?
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.020]   Jesus.
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.260]   So I had to think when he's telling this story,
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.020]   it has to be so personal to him
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.180]   because he's like, "The reason why you can come
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.020]   "to the porch and not be like this,
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.180]   "the reason why you don't have to be a slave,
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:39.660]   "the reason why God isn't an angry judge is because,"
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.020]   Come on.
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.440]   Come on, JD.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.420]   One down.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.020]   Wait for it.
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:53.400]   Man, cops ain't playing, y'all.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.780]   Because
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:01.780]   God sent me, knowing you would run from me,
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:05.700]   I ran down to you and I took your sin.
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.340]   I took your punishment.
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:12.580]   I took what you deserved and I died for it on the cross.
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:13.680]   And then I defeated it.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.500]   I shut it up once and for all.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.740]   I buried it in the grave,
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.100]   but I defeated it by rising from the grave three days later.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.820]   So that way, when the world tells you God doesn't love you,
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:26.540]   when your family demonstrates a conditional love with you,
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.700]   when your shame and guilt try to tell you
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.920]   you don't get to come in here and lift your hands freely,
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.520]   you can say, "Yeah, I can because of Jesus.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.840]   "I can come and sit at the table because of Jesus.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.860]   "I can feast and dine and simply be with God
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.280]   "as a son and daughter, not a slave,
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.340]   "because my God is not an angry judge.
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:48.180]   "He is a God who unconditionally loves me."
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.140]   And when your view of God is that
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.920]   he simply wants to be with you
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.920]   like a father wants to be with his child,
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.840]   when that is your view,
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.020]   that no matter what you've done because of his son,
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:58.900]   when that's your view,
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.140]   it changes everything about your response.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:05.800]   You now have the courage to come to him in your sin,
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.360]   in your darkest moment.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.800]   When you truly have the view,
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.760]   when Jesus is saying here,
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.000]   if you would understand the heart of your God,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.760]   it would change everything about how you view your past,
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.140]   mistakes, your sin, everything.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.000]   You're not coming over here
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.880]   just sheepishly crawling back going like,
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.340]   "Here God, let me give you some cake.
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.500]   "Here God, let me just serve you."
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.500]   You understand you have a seat at the table
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.740]   as a son and daughter, and he's asking you to feast,
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:37.080]   but you can't feast in chains.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:42.080]   You can't worship in chains.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.720]   You can't pray and serve and read
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.660]   and live life to the full in chains.
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.420]   And so I'm telling you tonight,
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.840]   if your response to God is to come in chains,
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.200]   take them off because Jesus rewrites stories.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.560]   Jesus takes away the things that once held you down
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.860]   and he sets you free.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:04.780]   Because of Jesus, you are a son and daughter.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.600]   That should be your view.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.840]   Your view of God is that he sees you
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.760]   as a son and a daughter,
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.840]   no matter what you've done, you can come.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:16.320]   And this is what he will do.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.480]   Verse 20, "He arose and came to his father,
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.100]   "but while he was still a long way off,
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:25.040]   "his father saw him and felt compassion."
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:29.080]   Some of you tonight need to simply hear that God sees it.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.580]   He sees the abortion.
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:35.920]   He sees the night you gave yourself away.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.840]   He sees the blackouts.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.560]   He sees the drugs.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.360]   He sees you laying there,
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:47.480]   contemplating and having a conversation with yourself going,
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.440]   would God want me back?
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.360]   Can I really serve at a church?
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.720]   Like, I know what I've done.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.020]   Like, he sees it all.
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:58.400]   And he's looking at every single one of you by name.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.000]   He's looking at me by name.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.680]   Guys, my past is riddled with mistakes.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.480]   I am the least of these.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.440]   I am undeserving, the most undeserving.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.640]   In this story, it just, it gets me every time,
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.680]   no matter how many times I hear it,
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.320]   because I'm reminded that God looks at me
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.900]   crawling back to church, crawling back to him,
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.840]   going, I'm so sorry, take me as a slave.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.400]   And he feels compassion.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.080]   He feels compassion.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.000]   A lot of you, it's hard to believe
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.920]   because you came back to a person,
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.760]   wanted to be met with love,
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.840]   and they gave you shame and anger and unforgiveness.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.200]   That's not your God.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.060]   You do not need to project another experience onto your God
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.520]   because his love is unlike anything else in this world.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.680]   It's, you can't compare it to anything.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.200]   It's uncomparable.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.600]   It's unimaginable.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.900]   And it keeps going deeper and deeper and deeper.
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.340]   The more you trust yourself with him,
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.660]   it's the best love to ever exist.
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.160]   And he felt compassion.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.080]   And he ran and embraced him and kissed him.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:32:59.920]   The son said to him,
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.920]   "Father, I have sinned against heaven before you.
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:02.920]   "I'm no longer worthy."
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.480]   And the father just says, "Hey, interrupt.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.680]   "Servants, bring the robe, bring the shoes, bring the ring.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.640]   "Kill the calf, have the party.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.940]   "It's time to celebrate.
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.360]   "My son was gone.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.860]   "My son was dead and he is found.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.840]   "He is back.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.160]   "It's time to celebrate."
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.320]   And tonight, I'm telling you,
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.380]   God's response is the same to you.
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.280]   If our view of somebody determines our response to him,
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.920]   what does this man's response to his son
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.680]   say about his view of his son?
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.600]   What is God's response to you?
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.560]   By sending his son to run and meet you in your sin
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.800]   and in your depravity,
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.000]   what is his response to you say about his view of you,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.140]   that you're worth it?
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:44.360]   He felt so unworthy to be called a son.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.320]   He says, "You're worth it.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.180]   "I'd die for you.
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.020]   "You're worth it.
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:47.900]   "Just come to me.
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.260]   "Let me throw a party."
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.800]   The Bible says when one repentant person comes,
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.120]   the angels celebrate in heaven.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.300]   There's a party being thrown
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.840]   for those who will just simply come
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.740]   because they believe their view of God says,
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:33:59.740]   "God, I'm choosing to believe
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.020]   "that you won't withhold from me.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.380]   "God, I'm choosing to believe
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.800]   "that you aren't some angry judge
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.520]   "who's out to get me because of my mistakes,
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.000]   "that you unconditionally love me
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.420]   "and you wanna give me my best life with you,
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:13.040]   "but you've gotta make the step to come back."
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.960]   While I was worshiping, I looked down at my wedding ring,
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.480]   and this ring is a sign
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.360]   of my proposed unconditional love for my wife.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:27.060]   And because I'm human, I'm gonna get it wrong.
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.840]   I know that we're in the honeymoon phase right now,
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.280]   and I'm sure in the years down the road,
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.800]   I'm gonna do things, I know me,
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.780]   I'm gonna do things that she's like, "It's really hard.
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:35.920]   "It's really hard."
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.240]   But just like this ring,
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.760]   it just continues to keep going and keep going
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.680]   and keep going.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.400]   It's not even a reminder of my bad,
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.000]   but God's good that his love just keeps going
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.040]   and keeps going and keeps going.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.560]   And it's available for you tonight,
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:55.040]   but you have to have the right view of him.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.840]   And if you would focus
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.180]   and have the right view of God's unconditional love for you,
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:03.760]   and if you would respond to that love,
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.420]   it'll change everything.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.260]   Let's pray.
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:12.000]   God, I ask that you would truly come
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.040]   and speak to the person right now
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.720]   who has a wrong view of you.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.000]   And would you redirect their view?
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.480]   Would you change their vocabulary?
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.600]   Would you shift their experience?
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.780]   And right now, would they experience you?
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.000]   Would they understand
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.400]   that they are trading the palace for the pigs?
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:34.500]   That they are choosing sin over a savior?
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.200]   And when they make the step,
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.440]   would they come to their senses?
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.120]   And as they are coming back to you,
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.880]   maybe timid, maybe ashamed,
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:43.960]   would you run right now?
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.240]   And would you show them the compassion you see
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.400]   when you look at them and say, "I've got it.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.200]   "I've sent my son, I've got it."
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.840]   And would the response be to celebrate?
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.040]   For those that have come back to you,
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.920]   may we celebrate in this response.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.320]   For those who need to come to you,
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.320]   may we respond in this response to you.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.260]   In this response, not because
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:09.060]   of anything to do with ourself,
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.200]   but everything, God, everything,
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.420]   because of what you've done for us.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:17.780]   We give you this moment.
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:22.060]   I give you, God, just these next minutes together,
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.860]   asking that you would call people back home.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:28.380]   May we respond now, in the name that I pray, amen.
