[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.320]   Hey, I'm gonna start with reading the passage
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.600]   in First Peter that we're checking out tonight.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.040]   So you guys open if you have a Bible to First Peter with me
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.760]   and I will read it and then pray and we'll dive in.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.620]   First Peter chapter one, starting in verse six is this,
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.560]   Peter writing, "In this,"
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.080]   talking about the eternal inheritance
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.960]   JP talked about last week, "you rejoice,
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.000]   "though now for a little while, if necessary,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.720]   "you have been grieved by various trials,
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.960]   "so that the tested genuineness of your faith,
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.700]   "more precious than gold that perishes,
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.040]   "though it, like your faith, is tested by fire,"
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.140]   not by trials,
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.280]   "may be found to result in praise and glory
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.920]   "and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ,"
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.280]   or when Jesus comes back.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.400]   "Though you have not seen him, Jesus, you love him.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.840]   "Though you do not see him now, you believe in him
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.320]   "and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.960]   "and filled with glory,
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.140]   "obtaining the outcome of your faith,
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.400]   "the salvation of your souls.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.560]   "Concerning this salvation, the prophets,"
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.660]   that's the Old Testament,
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.720]   "who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours,
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.520]   "searched and inquired carefully,
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.840]   "inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.640]   "was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ,"
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.120]   in the Old Testament, "and the subsequent glories.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.060]   "It was revealed to them," the prophets,
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.380]   "that they were serving not themselves
[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.680]   "in the things that have now been announced to you
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.280]   "through those who preached the good news to you
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.920]   "by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven."
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.160]   Things, this whole storyline,
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.720]   things into which angels long to look.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.560]   Let me pray, we'll dive in.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.640]   Father, we thank you for your word.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.040]   We thank you just for the words of Peter.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.680]   And we thank you that you take fishermen
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.080]   who are broken, sinful men like Peter
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.160]   and sinful men like me,
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.880]   and you offer us grace and you offer us new life.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.080]   We pray that the words that Peter, who you called the rock,
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.840]   would sharpen our hearts, would instruct us,
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.680]   would encourage us in the midst of trials that we face,
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.240]   in the midst of just this world around us,
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.520]   that he would allow your word to just pierce
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.720]   into whatever we're facing right now.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.760]   For friends that are listening either online
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.880]   or friends in Houston and Fort Worth
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.200]   and all over the country that are tuning in with us,
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.880]   Lord, that you would do the same there.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.520]   Lord, we leave here more in love with Jesus.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.680]   What a tragedy it would be to come to church
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.000]   and go through the motions and not love you more
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.960]   and not know you more.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.160]   Would that happen now, Lord?
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.400]   For anyone who doesn't know you, would you open eyes,
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.000]   allow the hearts of those inside of this room
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.240]   who don't know you to be softened,
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.440]   and would you stretch out your hand
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.760]   and do what only you can do, which is save people.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.600]   We love you.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.760]   Thank you for Jesus, amen.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.720]   I was gonna start with a little story
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.000]   that happened not too long ago.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I guess it was a few years now,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.360]   but it was when I was engaged to my wife, Callie.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.200]   So when you get engaged, you buy the engagement ring,
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.600]   you get down on one knee, and then you propose,
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.920]   and hopefully they say yes,
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.480]   and then you're officially engaged.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.240]   There's another piece of jewelry
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.240]   that is involved when you get engaged.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.280]   Anyone know what it is called?
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.120]   A wedding, okay, guys, you're gonna need to know this, man.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.000]   There's something called a wedding band
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.760]   that once you get engaged, the game is not over.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.080]   You also not only have an engagement ring
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.480]   you're proposing with, but on the day of the wedding,
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.120]   you place not the engagement ring,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.360]   but a wedding band on side of this person
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.760]   or on side of your fiance.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.700]   And so my wedding was coming up,
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.900]   I needed to get a wedding band.
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.420]   I had recently got engaged, and my fiance, Callie,
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.040]   said my grandmother has some diamonds
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.560]   that she wanted to give to whoever got engaged to me
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.480]   for this wedding band.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.380]   I'm like, dude, holla at you.
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.600]   Boy, this girl comes with diamonds, awesome.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.560]   And so I'm like, this is great, man, I love it.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.320]   Grandma knows, working on a budget.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.960]   I'll take those, I take the diamonds, this is awesome.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.160]   Take a new jewelry, they put 'em on this band,
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.600]   and I'm all set, ready to go.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.840]   I'm making sure this very expensive, valuable,
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.480]   thousands of dollars, more expensive than anything I owned,
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.800]   I make sure that I keep this in a very, very safe place
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.480]   and make sure that it's ready for the wedding day.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.000]   Wedding day comes, ceremony takes place,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.760]   everything goes great, put it on her hand,
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.040]   everything's great, go to the honeymoon, married.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.080]   It's awesome.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.760]   Come back from the honeymoon a few weeks later
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.140]   and realize that, oh my gosh,
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.440]   we need to go get that wedding band appraised
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.640]   because if we lose grandma's diamonds,
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.360]   we are not replacing grandma's diamonds.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.560]   If something happens or they break off,
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.640]   if it's not insured, then we won't be able to replace it.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.680]   So in order to get it insured,
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.760]   you gotta go get it appraised,
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.540]   jeweler says, oh, it's worth this much,
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.300]   turn this into the insurance company.
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.040]   So we go to the jewelry store, get there,
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.200]   hand 'em the diamond, hand 'em the wedding band,
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.460]   they take it back, they look at it,
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.300]   all of a sudden the guy's like,
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.960]   oh man, I'm gonna have to take this back to the back.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.160]   Goes back to the back, does, I'm not exactly sure what,
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.120]   but he looks at it and he just said,
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.480]   man, we're inspecting it, put it underneath this microscope.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.640]   And he comes back and he says, these are fake diamonds.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.560]   (laughing)
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.280]   Yeah, I know, and he's like, grandma, are you serious?
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.520]   You gave us fake diamonds?
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.640]   And I'm like, no, that can't be right,
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.640]   you must be mistaken.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.400]   He's like, I looked at 'em, these are not real diamonds.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.680]   These are fake, they're worthless.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.240]   And I'm like, okay, worthless, ouch,
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.720]   even fake ones are worth nothing.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.680]   And the reason I start with that
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.040]   is because just like in that scenario
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.360]   where we had been carrying around,
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.960]   I mean, my wife had this band on
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.240]   that she'd been carrying around on herself,
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.020]   something that she thought was incredibly value,
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.400]   she was taking everywhere that she went,
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.560]   she thought it was of incredible value,
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.380]   and it ended up being totally fake and worthless.
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.400]   And the apostle Peter tonight is gonna say
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.440]   that for many of us or for many people,
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.860]   based on what he lays out in terms of faith,
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.040]   when it comes to the thing that they're carrying around
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.380]   they think is faith, he would say it's fake, it's worthless.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.840]   And as tragic as it is to get a wedding band
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.040]   that you end up discovering,
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.720]   oh my gosh, these are fake diamonds,
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.240]   how much more tragic would it be to go
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.640]   and at the end of your life realize
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.200]   that the thing that you said was faith,
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.200]   some belief in God or some prayer
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.700]   that you had prayed when you were younger
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.500]   and you thought you possessed this faith that was true,
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.640]   never was.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.120]   And so tonight, he's gonna lay out what true faith,
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.000]   what the qualities of true faith look like.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.040]   If you take notes, you can write down
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.400]   the qualities of true faith as he just instructs us
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.200]   on some of the attributes that if a person is to have faith,
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.000]   what they're gonna experience and what makes up
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.720]   what true faith looks like when it's displayed.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.520]   Specifically, what he's gonna tell us
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.260]   is how true faith is refined,
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.640]   how true faith is defined,
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.880]   and then what true faith focuses on.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.480]   So we'll start in verse six and pick up right
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.680]   where we left off and continue going there
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.520]   and read it again.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.720]   Here's what he says.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.880]   In this, again, talking about the eternal inheritance
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.640]   that we covered last week, if you missed it,
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.600]   check out the Porch app, go listen to J.P.'s message.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.560]   It was incredible.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.280]   Make sure that you catch it and stay tuned with us
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.400]   as we go through 1 Peter.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.080]   But he says, "In this, eternal inheritance, you rejoice,
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.580]   "though now for a little while,
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.720]   "you have been grieved by various trials."
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.160]   So he's writing to an audience of Christian.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.000]   He's saying, look, there's gonna be an eternal inheritance,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.460]   but right now in this life,
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.600]   you're gonna walk through all kinds of trials.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.800]   What do they do in your life?
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.640]   So that the tested genuineness of your faith,
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.260]   that they begin to test your faith,
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.560]   which is more a faith more precious than gold,
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.360]   that perishes, though it is also like faith,
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.640]   tested by fire, may be found a result, your faith,
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.700]   in praise and glory and honor
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.040]   at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.920]   What did Peter just say?
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.580]   Peter just said that for believers inside of Christianity,
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.920]   when you become a Christian,
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.260]   God does not promise that he's gonna protect you from pain,
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.680]   but he promises a purpose in the pain in your life,
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.960]   in the pain in my life,
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.800]   that he doesn't promise like,
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.400]   hey, you become a Christian, you sign up,
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.300]   everything's gonna be great from here on out.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.020]   He doesn't promise protection from pain.
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.100]   He promises a purpose for your pain.
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.740]   And that is that trials are the thing
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.140]   that will refine and purify,
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.740]   will test and prove your faith to be true.
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.600]   The first idea from the text is that true faith
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.980]   is refined by trials.
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.740]   True faith, if you have true faith,
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.520]   it is something that will be refined
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.820]   by the trials inside of your life,
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.780]   no matter how big, no matter how small.
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.920]   I mean, Christianity, this is why people,
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.420]   the idea even Peter introduces that,
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.220]   man, you're going to face trials.
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.960]   There's gonna be things in your life that fall apart.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.900]   Singleness, a parent who divorced,
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.960]   the loss of a loved one, cancer,
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.500]   the loss of a loved one, cancer,
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.240]   whatever it is, Peter's gonna say you're gonna face.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.740]   This is why the idea that if you follow Jesus,
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.140]   and man, I wish this was true,
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.100]   it'd make life so much easier, wouldn't it?
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.200]   Hey, if you follow Jesus,
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.840]   everything's gonna be great in your life.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.980]   You're gonna be healthy, wealthy, wise,
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.820]   it's all gonna be great.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.820]   It's just a lie.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.340]   It's something called the prosperity gospel.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.860]   It just flies in the face of the New Testament teaching
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.960]   or of Peter, who got crucified upside down,
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.500]   who would say, man, if you follow Jesus,
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.360]   he doesn't promise protection from the pain in this world,
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.300]   but he does promise a purpose towards it.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.800]   And one of the primary purposes
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.700]   is that he will use it to refine the faith
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.540]   that you and I have.
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.340]   And he uses this illustration that, man, I just love.
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.500]   It's brilliant, of Peter.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.520]   He says, just like gold is tested and refined in the fire,
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.280]   faith is tested and refined in trials of life.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.380]   Whatever hard thing you're going through right now
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.160]   is something that God will use
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.560]   if we allow him to refine and grow our faith,
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.860]   grow our trust in him.
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:45.960]   And he uses the fire thing.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.160]   Here's why the fire thing's brilliant.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.260]   Here's the word that he uses for tested,
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.400]   both on your faith and with gold in the fire.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.600]   It's a metalsmith word or a goldsmith word
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.060]   that was used at this time.
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.260]   And it was a word that basically mean,
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.840]   it was the process by which gold would be refined.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.940]   Here's how gold gets refined.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.000]   Take a piece of gold, heat up this oven,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.480]   get it real, real hot, put the piece of gold in there,
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.480]   let it boil a little bit, pull it out,
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.820]   and all of a sudden the impurities rise to the top.
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.080]   They wipe off the impurities.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.280]   You may have heard it called dross.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.120]   That's what that is.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.160]   They stick it back in, make it even hotter.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.180]   The impurities continue to rise to the top,
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.220]   scrape them away.
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.200]   You know when they know that the gold has been tested
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.440]   or has been purified?
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.440]   When you can see, or the goldsmith can see his reflection
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.940]   in the gold.
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.200]   When he can see it clearly,
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.600]   he knows that the gold has been tested.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.700]   Why is that significant?
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.000]   It's the same thing that Christ does through trials,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.840]   through all of life,
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.840]   or is working towards in everyone who says they're a
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.540]   Christian or everyone who is a Christian.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.680]   Where he is working about and bringing all things
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.880]   for the good of those who love him to be conformed.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.120]   He's trying to make his reflection in your life
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.300]   more evident, more clear.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.060]   What God is doing through trials in your life
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.760]   and all of your life if you're a Christian,
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.720]   is he's trying to make his reflection,
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.920]   when he looks into and sees your life,
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.520]   that it would more clearly reflect his reflection.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.400]   Peter says that's what trials inside of our life are doing.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.320]   That he's using it to make us to more clearly see
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.760]   the presence of God in our life.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.180]   I think when I read this, I'm like,
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.480]   man, I both want to become more refined,
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.360]   at the same time I'm like,
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.400]   can we do it without the whole fire thing or the trial thing?
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.920]   And it's crazy that the things, the faith,
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.000]   I wanna have big faith,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.720]   but I don't wanna have the circumstances that require it.
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.260]   I have a friend who I was talking to today,
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.500]   and we were talking about this first,
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.680]   and I was like, man, I wanna know that this is true,
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.080]   'cause you're walking through the fire of trial.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.540]   He's a 26-year-old guy on our staff.
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.700]   He has a four-week-old daughter that four weeks ago,
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.520]   they went to the hospital, they're so pumped,
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.020]   first baby, everything's excited,
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.260]   fast driving to the hospital,
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.020]   we're getting there, it's all gonna be great.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.340]   And the delivery takes place,
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.740]   and she was 100% healthy, the baby, beforehand.
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:03.580]   And in the delivery of the baby, his little baby girl,
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.060]   she breathed in fluid
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.260]   that she should not have breathed in.
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.420]   And she ends up having to be life-flighted
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.220]   to Children's Hospital.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.660]   And for the next four weeks, she's been fighting for her life
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.460]   and I was asking John, his name's John,
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.860]   and I was like, dude, tell me how this is true.
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.080]   How have you seen God grow you?
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.020]   How have you seen more?
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.540]   How has he refined your faith in the midst of this?
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.100]   Just tell me what this is like,
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.020]   'cause honestly, the trials in my life,
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.620]   they pale in comparison to what you're going through.
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.380]   And he said, man, I remember I was sitting there,
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.760]   we were on the 12th floor of this children's building,
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.060]   and I was praying to God.
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.660]   And it was when we thought she was gonna die.
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.260]   And she's doing better now,
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.660]   and she's still been on the oxygen machine
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.900]   and on the life machine.
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.980]   And he said, I was sitting there, but this was then.
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.780]   And we were thinking that she wasn't gonna make it,
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:52.900]   and I'm just praying, God,
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.500]   this is either gonna push me away from you,
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.960]   or it's gonna push me towards you.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.580]   And I don't want it to push me away from you, God.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.560]   Will you please, Lord,
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.420]   will you help my unbelief in the midst of this?
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.400]   Will you help me?
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.740]   And he said it was like through prayer
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.860]   on side of that floor that God began to reveal,
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.980]   and he began to be confronted with the idea that, man,
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.460]   Jesus, he's either enough or he's not.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.060]   And Lord, I believe that you're enough.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.220]   I believe you're a good father,
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.380]   that I can ask you, Lord, save my daughter.
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.180]   But I believe that you're enough.
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.140]   Jesus, you're enough.
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.060]   And he said, in a new way that I could have told you
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.100]   and answered on test, Jesus is enough.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.580]   But in a new way that wasn't just words,
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.180]   I came to realize that he is.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:41.020]   And in the midst of trials, we more clearly see that.
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.920]   In the midst of trials,
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.660]   JP and I were talking a few minutes ago backstage
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:49.240]   of what's crazy about trials is like faith shines brightest
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.320]   in the darkness of trials, doesn't it?
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.260]   Like nobody in here, if you're like going through a season
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260]   of like singleness or job challenges
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.600]   or like divorce of your parents,
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.420]   that's when faith is like most needed
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.980]   and most shines brightly.
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.720]   When you walk by faith in those circumstances,
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.020]   it's like a wonder to the rest of us.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.260]   Nobody's like, oh my gosh, it takes so much faith
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.340]   to be the pretty girl who gets married
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.100]   and has like a full, you know, horde of children
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.300]   and you got the suburban,
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.180]   you got everything you want in life.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.620]   And yeah, you're so beautiful.
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.100]   And yeah, I wish I looked like that too.
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.100]   It doesn't take as much faith to be X person
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.200]   or whatever the story.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.220]   But those of us who walk through trials,
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.440]   it's staggering to a watching world.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.620]   The person who says, look, my God is in the heavens
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.780]   and I trust the story he's writing my life.
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.660]   What else am I gonna do?
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:36.540]   That person, faith is most needed in the midst of trials.
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.780]   Faith most shines brightly.
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:42.340]   Trust is seen most clearly in the midst
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.460]   of trials around us.
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.700]   Whatever you're facing, God is at work to refine your faith.
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.080]   True faith is always refined in the midst of trials,
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.880]   whether it is singleness or it's job loss
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.920]   or whatever's in front of you.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.220]   Maybe it's a relationship that just broke up.
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:01.480]   God says, are you gonna trust me with this?
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:06.600]   And if you will, I will use it to continue to refine,
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.360]   grow, strengthen your faith.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.100]   True faith is refined in the fire.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.720]   That's not only the thing that he says,
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.920]   he goes into what true faith is defined as
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.720]   and he gives us Peter's definition, if you will,
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.540]   of what it is.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.380]   Here's what he says.
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.600]   Though you have not seen him, that's Christ,
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.760]   he begins to lay out one of the first parts of faith,
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.940]   which is uncertainty.
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.180]   You love Christ.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.400]   Though you do not see him now,
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.160]   you believe or you trust in Christ.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.440]   He gives us three qualities.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.480]   And you rejoice, that's our third.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.560]   So though you don't see him, you love him.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.000]   Though you don't see him, you believe or you trust in him.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.460]   And though you don't see him, you're filled with joy
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.080]   that's inexpressible, filled with glory,
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.960]   obtaining the outcome of your faith,
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.600]   the salvation of your souls.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.920]   Our second point that Peter lays out tonight
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.880]   is that true faith is defined by love, trust, and joy,
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:58.720]   according to Peter.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.800]   True faith is defined by love, trust, and joy.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.020]   Here's what's interesting about the two words
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.760]   of love and trust that he uses.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.160]   The first one on love, he doesn't use,
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.560]   he says somebody who has real faith,
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.880]   you wanna know who has real faith?
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.400]   It's someone who has this actual, genuine love for Christ,
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.120]   who has this actual, like, man, I really,
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.540]   at the end of the day, I love Jesus.
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.520]   Even if everyone else falls away, Lord,
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.520]   I really love you.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.840]   He says that's one of the marks of it.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.780]   But it's not just, it's not like the love
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.080]   that we think of when we think of love
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.920]   'cause our culture's kinda ruined it.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.080]   Like, we think, like, oh man, the bachelor,
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.120]   and Nick, and this is so beautiful.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.160]   And that's not what Peter's talking about,
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.340]   of this feeling of love.
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.520]   He uses a word that's a verb, this agape.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.720]   It's a sacrificing love.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.280]   He says you wanna know someone who genuinely has faith,
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.920]   true faith, is marked by three qualities.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.760]   One of them is a love or a serving of Christ.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:47.940]   One of the things that marks their life
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.680]   is that they have this love that moves them to serve,
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.280]   sacrifice, I'm servant of Christ.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.400]   He says that's the first thing.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.040]   Second thing is trust, which is also an action.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.000]   Someone who has a true faith is someone who says,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.600]   look, I trust you.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.640]   I don't do it perfectly, but at the end of the day,
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.520]   my heart's desire is that I would trust you.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.840]   I wanna trust you with tomorrow.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.320]   I wanna trust you with my future.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.560]   I wanna trust you with whatever you have
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.800]   in terms of my romance story, or will I ever get marriage?
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.360]   I'm gonna trust you with my job.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.560]   I'm gonna trust you with whatever it is, my finances,
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.240]   how you say I should steward money,
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.560]   how you say I should handle sexuality.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.400]   I trust you, Lord.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.320]   I'm gonna do what you say.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.520]   Peter says that someone who has true faith
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.440]   is marked by a genuine love or service of Christ,
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.120]   and a genuine trust, like I can trust him.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.160]   Now, I'm not gonna do it perfectly, but I trust you, God.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.000]   Help me to trust you more.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.400]   And the third is this joy,
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.840]   that not just this happiness of today and tomorrow,
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.280]   but they're marked in life by this joy
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.280]   that's not based on circumstances from the world around us.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:52.040]   It's a joy that comes from the eternal inheritance
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.520]   that awaits them, the eternity they're gonna spend with God.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.620]   Someone said today that in the face of trials,
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.520]   Christians don't always immediately have joy,
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.820]   but they inevitably do.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.640]   That in the face of trials,
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.960]   Christians don't always immediately, but inevitably,
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.040]   with time and with Christ working in their life,
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.440]   they look back and they see that God was at work
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.680]   in the midst of those trials.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.180]   Now, I wanna pause here and talk about just quickly
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.880]   the idea of faith, 'cause here's what Peter just said.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.960]   Hey, if you wanna be a Christian,
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.120]   you wanna have true faith,
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.520]   you need to love somebody you don't see,
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.640]   you need to trust somebody you don't see,
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.880]   you need to have joy that comes from somebody you don't see.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.560]   And inside of this room, I know there's a lot of people,
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.120]   or there's at least some of us who are like,
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.080]   dude, this is why I don't think
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.320]   I'll ever become a Christian,
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.420]   'cause I'm kinda one of these like,
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.740]   I need to see it to believe it kind of people.
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.360]   Like, I want God to show up in my room,
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.400]   and if he comes like in a dream,
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.600]   I'll be like, oh, okay, I guess I'll go with you.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.000]   And that's the kind of person that I need.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   I need some like hard proof, I need some facts,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.900]   some evidence in order to believe in something.
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.080]   And I would say, man, you're not crazy.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:57.240]   I just think you're a little bit disingenuous.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.120]   I mean, you believe in things all the time
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.560]   without having cold, hard evidence.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.160]   I was talking to a friend a couple of weeks ago,
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.560]   we were talking about just this idea,
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.240]   and I had the same, he was reluctant,
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.240]   he was like, man, I just like need hard proof,
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.880]   and we'll talk about that in a second,
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.260]   but I was like, dude, you believe things all the time
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.320]   that you don't have any proof for,
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.800]   that you've never seen firsthand.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.640]   And he was like, what are you talking about?
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.520]   I was like, do you believe in George Washington?
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.440]   And he was like, yeah, duh, I believe,
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.540]   I'm like, you ever met George Washington?
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.580]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.980]   He's like, no.
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.800]   Hmm, you ever met anyone who met George Washington?
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.120]   No, dude, they're all dead, he lived like 200 years ago.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.440]   Dude, you believe in George Washington by faith.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.640]   I'm not even sure the guy lived.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.720]   He's like, he's on the coin, he has a house.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.880]   That doesn't mean anything.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.320]   Somebody like in the 1800s could have
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.600]   made this whole thing up.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.920]   You believe by faith in George Washington, it's true.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.680]   And when it comes to the message of Christianity,
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.760]   we don't just blindly, if you ever become a Christian,
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.680]   it won't be when you're just like, dude,
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.480]   I'll just blindly, I guess, go along with what seems crazy.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.740]   Here's in my heart of hearts, where the things that,
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.880]   when I look at the evidence compelling around Christianity,
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.440]   because here's a secret, even pastors doubt.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.960]   Even pastors go like, man, am I crazy?
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.160]   Is this like, is this just some good guy who showed up
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.800]   a long time ago and this whole thing is made up?
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.660]   And you know what makes me doubt my doubts?
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.160]   Like there's just certain undeniable things
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.440]   that I just can't escape.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.760]   When I look at the world, there's no explanation
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.920]   other than that he wasn't just some good guy who showed up,
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.360]   who by the way, said crazy people things,
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.340]   if he's just some good guy, like, hey, I'm God.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.360]   Nobody calls the guy who's like, hey, I'm God.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.480]   That's a good guy right there, I love that guy.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.600]   Come on, good guy.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.440]   Nobody says that about the guy who claims to be God.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.720]   Jesus showed up on the scene.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.080]   You know what makes sense of the fact that you and I
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.340]   even know who this person was?
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.040]   The fact that 2,000 years ago, if he was just some guy,
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.720]   it wouldn't be his teachings.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.040]   In other words, the reason that you and I,
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.400]   when I move towards doubt, the reason,
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.120]   when I look at the evidence, what explanation works
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.960]   other than he was a man who became,
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.160]   God who became a man who rose from the dead?
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.600]   Could it really be that, man, he was just some good teacher
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.400]   and like his good sayings really were promoted really well?
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.440]   That's lunacy.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.120]   Jesus, a Jewish peasant from the armpit of Rome,
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.400]   a place on the map you can't even point to.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.040]   And if you can, it's only for one reason.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.560]   Either because the Middle East conflict
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.360]   or because Jesus was there.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.400]   Jesus, who showed up on the scene,
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.720]   who was a man that taught things
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.440]   that other people had taught at the time.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.760]   Like, hey, you should really be nice to people.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.800]   Turn on the other cheek.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.120]   Things that would have never made it out of the first century
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.420]   aside from one other teaching that he had,
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:36.760]   which was this, I will die and I will rise again.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.520]   And hundreds, and listen to me right here.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.320]   Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people,
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.880]   his followers, went to their deaths,
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.360]   not for what they said that they believed in.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.560]   They went to their deaths.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.060]   They were killed for what they said they saw.
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.200]   They said, I saw him die and I saw him buried
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.080]   and he came back alive.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.200]   And the reason that we believe is not, hold on.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.840]   The reason that they went to their deaths
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.680]   is not just 'cause they're like,
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.640]   man, I just believe in the movement, dude.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.480]   This is, yeah, this is go love wins.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.720]   It wasn't because of that.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.000]   The reason they went to the death
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.400]   is because of what they said they saw.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.680]   I saw him dead and he came back alive
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.000]   and you can kill me all you want.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.760]   He came back alive and he said, if I trust in him,
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.680]   I'm gonna live forever.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.280]   So I'm going with the guy who died and came back alive.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.880]   Sorry, you can kill me.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.280]   And that's how the movement began.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.760]   (congregation applauding)
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.280]   People all the time go to deaths for what they believe in.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.320]   That's what Jihad is.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.440]   That's what terrorism is.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.440]   They went to their deaths for what they said they saw.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.640]   Today, here's what else is undeniable evidence.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.320]   You and every person you interact with,
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.820]   every coworker you live next to,
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:35.880]   or every, we work next to,
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.640]   every person that you live in an apartment complex next to,
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.720]   they all dated their calendars 2017 years
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.880]   from a man who many say was just a good dude.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.920]   This is a good dude, a little crazy, but good dude.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.120]   That's insane.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.360]   There's no explanation that would satisfy
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.520]   why you should even know about a Jewish peasant
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.880]   unless he was the man who said he was.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.280]   And he came back alive.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.960]   Like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of followers
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.280]   said that he did.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.000]   What else is undeniable is that all over this planet,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.420]   2 billion people claim to have had an experience with God
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.400]   in a real way through Jesus Christ.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.480]   And here's what's crazy to me.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.960]   This minister's maybe just to me,
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.780]   but when you get around,
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.180]   if you've ever traveled to other countries
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.040]   or other continents and you get around them
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.640]   and there's like brothers and sisters in Korea and Peru,
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.760]   and you come together sometimes through a translator
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.520]   and you begin to hear their stories
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.320]   and they're eerily similar to stories you hear all the time.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.720]   They're, I mean like unsolved mystery stories.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.680]   Like yeah, this happened a month ago.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.920]   We had this church in from Korea
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.700]   and they were sharing their stories of young adults
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.680]   who said they grew up and they were kind of marginal
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.760]   in their faith, they went to college, something happened.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.600]   Somebody told them about Jesus and their life changed.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.760]   And you're like, dude, you don't even speak English.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.960]   This is unbelievable.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.520]   Christianity is not some American religion.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.040]   It's changing on every continent.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.080]   And what's undeniable, regardless of what you believe,
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.560]   is that on every continent in this world,
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.960]   every language that's being spoken with very few exceptions,
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.520]   every color of someone's skin,
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.800]   every status of what they make in terms of money,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.560]   there are people who claim to be followers of Jesus Christ.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.920]   What's undeniable is that inside of your heart
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.480]   and my heart is this human whole
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.560]   or this God-shaped whole, it's been said.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.440]   That no amount of sex, no amount of alcohol,
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.720]   nothing can satisfy.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:22.000]   What's undeniable is that this man, Jesus,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.280]   changed everything.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.160]   And you're either gonna say he was some, man,
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.760]   a really good guy who said crazy things or he was Lord,
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.840]   like 2 billion other people have.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.200]   Like throughout the centuries,
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.160]   billions and billions of us have declared
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.640]   because it's the most reasonable explanation
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.880]   for what has happened.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.080]   It's not just by some blind faith.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.320]   We do walk by faith, but it is not a blind faith.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.400]   And Peter says, if you're gonna walk by a true faith,
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.680]   you're gonna walk not by what you see, but what is unseen.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.880]   You're gonna trust in the Lord.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.840]   You're gonna love the Lord.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.640]   You're gonna trust him and you're gonna have joy,
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.880]   not anchored in this world, but in the life to come.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.920]   In him.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.520]   And he continues with a third idea from this text
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.480]   where he says this, talking about the salvation
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.920]   that you and I have received.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.080]   Concerning this salvation, verse 10, that the prophets,
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.800]   so now he talks about the Old Testament.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.520]   So he takes a little bit of a left turn here
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.720]   and he begins to go like, hey, you know that salvation,
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.640]   it's unbelievable, let me tell you a little bit
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.480]   about this salvation that you and I have.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.880]   And he says this, concerning this salvation,
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.760]   the prophets, or the Old Testament,
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.920]   that's where the prophets,
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.680]   that's where the prophets are found,
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.120]   who prophesied about the grace, they spoke beforehand.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.720]   They were writing these things like, hey,
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.820]   the Messiah's gonna come, the Savior's gonna do these things
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.160]   and Peter brings it up.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.880]   And they were prophesying about the grace
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.080]   that was to be yours.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.200]   They searched and inquired carefully,
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.880]   inquiring or wondering as they wrote,
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.820]   what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.680]   was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.540]   and subsequent glories.
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.480]   It was revealed to them that they were serving
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.600]   not themselves, but you,
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.900]   and the things that have now been announced to you
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.700]   through those who preach the good news to you
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.540]   by the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.720]   Peter, what are you saying?
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.560]   Here's what he just said.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.640]   Hey, this salvation has been something
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.360]   that God has been writing about the entire time.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.480]   The message of Christ coming and dying on a cross,
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.040]   and he says, and he brings up the prophets,
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.600]   basically he's saying like, hey, when Isaiah sat down,
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.120]   Isaiah's an Old Testament prophet.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.600]   When he sat down to write, the Spirit of Christ
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.320]   essentially said, I want you to write this down.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.600]   He will be bruised for our transgressions,
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.040]   wounded by his wounds, we will be healed.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.080]   Speaking of Jesus, and Isaiah's going,
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.880]   okay, the Savior's gonna be wounded for our transgression.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.880]   Yeah, and then write, he'll be born of a virgin.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.200]   I want you to write that one down, okay?
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.920]   And then he'll be called Emmanuel,
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.760]   all these different things.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.600]   And Isaiah, the scripture just said,
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.500]   all the prophets were wondering,
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.480]   I don't totally understand how this is all gonna work.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.640]   I'm writing these prophecies about the Messiah,
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.480]   the Savior God's gonna send,
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.440]   who will both be God and killed, I don't understand.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.160]   And he'll be the Savior of everyone who trusts in him,
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.940]   I don't understand, Peter just said.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.320]   And then he says, it's not only something
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.400]   that they long to understand and long to know more of,
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.800]   even the angelic realm looks at the story
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.160]   of what we call the gospel of God becoming a man
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.260]   and dying for us, and they wonder at it.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.900]   And the prophets looked and they searched
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.260]   and they just wanted to know how.
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.740]   They knew that God would send a Savior,
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.060]   they knew that God was gonna win,
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.520]   they just looked and they wanted to know how,
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.480]   Peter essentially says.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.400]   It's not dissimilar to this.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.920]   If you watch the Super Bowl,
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.580]   you may have experienced what I did,
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.920]   which is I watched the first half
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.780]   and then I turned off the Super Bowl,
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.740]   'cause I was like, dude, Brady, over the hill, man.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.900]   This is unbelievable, buddy, you just gotta hang 'em up,
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.020]   hang those cleats up.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.440]   And so we ended up watching another TV show,
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.780]   DVR'd the rest of the Super Bowl.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.420]   Super Bowl ends, I have no idea what's going on,
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.780]   I all of a sudden look on social media,
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.540]   it's like Patriots win, I'm like, this is insane.
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.340]   They won, and I go back to look at my DVR
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.740]   and it cuts off the last five minutes of the game,
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.620]   also the best part of the game,
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.980]   where it's like, he's like diving for a catch
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.380]   and it literally cuts off.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.540]   And so now I begin to like search,
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:06.980]   I'm like looking on YouTube, trying to find like,
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.540]   how did they, I wanna know, I know that they won already,
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:10.940]   but how did they win?
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.760]   Peter just said that the prophets in the angelic realm
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.520]   looked at the story that God was writing,
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.320]   even the prophets writing about how Christ
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.560]   would be crucified or how we would die,
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.640]   and they just wanted to know how this could all make sense,
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.720]   how could the Savior do these things and he win?
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.560]   I know he wins, I just want to know how.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.480]   And the answer was through the cross of Christ,
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.320]   through the cross of Christ.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.000]   Our third idea from the text is that true faith
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.280]   is faith in the work of Christ on the cross.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.360]   That just like all of the Old Testament
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.840]   is centered on the cross of Christ,
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.060]   so all of true faith, if you're gonna have true faith,
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.200]   man, this is so huge, I hope you get this.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.000]   It's gonna be at the epicenter of it,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.140]   it's not gonna be faith in the idea
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.520]   of you being a good person,
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.220]   it'll be faith in the work of Christ on the cross
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.100]   on your behalf.
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:59.180]   The entire story of the Old Testament
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.440]   is all about the work of Christ on the cross.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.980]   It's all been pointed to that.
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.220]   From beginning to end, all of it is meant to climax,
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.500]   meant to culminate in the story of God becoming a man,
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.140]   dying in your place on the cross.
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.280]   Every story points to it,
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.740]   there's prophecies all throughout it,
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.260]   every page points to Jesus
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.600]   and the work of Christ on the cross.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.440]   If you don't believe me,
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.740]   there's examples of specific prophecies that point to it.
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.500]   Psalm 22 says that Jesus would be 1,000 years
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.940]   before he even was born.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.500]   It said he would be crucified
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.300]   through his hands and through his feet.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:32.500]   Crucifixion didn't even exist for another 600 years.
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.420]   Think about that.
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.340]   It's pointing to this day that it's coming.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.900]   Isaiah 53 says that Christ, like we referred to earlier,
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.720]   would be crushed for our transgressions,
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.020]   that God would send a savior
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.460]   and he would die in our place
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.660]   all throughout the Old Testament.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.620]   Jesus even says this on the road to Emmaus
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.900]   to some of his disciples who were like,
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.700]   "Yeah, I just don't understand how the Messiah could die."
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.980]   And he says this in Luke 24.
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.460]   "Foolish ones and slow of heart
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.600]   "to believe all the prophets have spoken.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.780]   "Was it not necessary that the Christ
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.580]   "should suffer these things and enter into his glory
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.020]   "and beginning," Jesus begins with these two guys
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:09.880]   walking on the road,
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.820]   "beginning with Moses and all of the prophets
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.180]   "he interpreted them in all the scriptures,
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.420]   "the things that are concerning himself."
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.940]   That Jesus sits these guys down and he's like,
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.920]   "Look, on every page it points to me."
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:22.680]   Wait a second, Leviticus points to you?
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.500]   The sacrificial system,
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.820]   that blood would need to be spilled
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.980]   in order for man to be forgiven.
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:31.300]   It was always pointing to Jesus, the ultimate lamb of God.
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.220]   Even the stories point to him.
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.300]   Think about it, Noah.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.540]   Think about the story of Noah.
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.320]   Okay, Noah, God shows up to Noah, says,
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.160]   "Hey, look, I'm gonna flood the earth.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.360]   "I need you to build a piece of wood.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.820]   "And I need you to tell everyone you can
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.660]   "about that piece of wood.
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.380]   "Tell them to get onto the wood, trust the wood."
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.080]   And when the floods came,
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.580]   everyone who trusted in this piece of wood
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.620]   that was lifted up was saved.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.060]   What does that sound like?
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.420]   Everyone who trusted in this piece of wood,
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.940]   AKA a cross, was saved.
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.260]   The story of Moses.
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.060]   Moses, you've heard Charleston Heston,
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.580]   he goes into Egypt, Pharaoh's in there.
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.660]   Hey, let my people go.
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:06.500]   You've heard that story.
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.260]   What's the circumstance?
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.300]   It all points to Christ.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:14.500]   God's people are in bondage, unable to save themselves.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.060]   All of a sudden, a deliverer is sent in,
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:20.020]   and he alone, Moses, later to be named Jesus,
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.980]   goes in and delivers the people,
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.700]   just like Jesus shows up,
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.500]   and God's people who were in bondage to sin
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.140]   and Satan and death,
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.720]   and he becomes the deliverer who sets them free.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.900]   The story of David.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.620]   Think about this, David and Goliath, all right?
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.860]   So David and Goliath, you know, 16-year-old kid,
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.420]   five stones, kills a giant named Goliath.
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.660]   You know what the number five stands for in Hebrew?
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.060]   Hebrew has this numerical system
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.340]   where the numbers can point to words.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.540]   The number five is grace.
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:51.620]   So David shows up, and he slays a giant with grace.
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.260]   What does that sound like?
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.580]   The same Jesus who showed up
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.860]   and didn't just slay Goliath, this nine-foot-tall person,
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.140]   but he slayed the giants of sin, Satan, and death,
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:31:59.960]   with what?
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.660]   With grace.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.620]   All of it points to him, Jonah, the prophet,
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.620]   who goes three days, dies three days,
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.020]   in the belly of a well, is resurrected three days later,
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:09.260]   and goes and proclaims news.
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.700]   Every page of your Bible,
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.040]   it's always been pointing to Jesus.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.420]   It all points to Jesus at every level.
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.920]   The Bible, if you were not raised in church,
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.980]   maybe it's your first time back in a while,
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.580]   the Bible is not this story of a bunch of good stories
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:21.420]   and good people.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.180]   It's a story of a bunch of bad people,
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:27.000]   and one good guy named Jesus,
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.520]   and all the bad guys kill him.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.620]   That's how bad we are.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.020]   And whoever trusts in this one good person
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:34.860]   will have eternal life.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.900]   It's not good people in heaven and bad people in hell.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.680]   It's forgiven people in heaven.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.640]   And there is one way to get forgiveness.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.400]   That is by trusting in Christ alone,
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.400]   in his work on the cross, on your behalf,
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.560]   and on my behalf,
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.160]   in all of the pages of the Old Testament.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.640]   They've always been pointing to it.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.960]   If you were in this room,
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.520]   and you were putting your faith
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.180]   in what you do,
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.820]   and how you behave, in other words,
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.440]   like, hey, if I'm gonna go before God,
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.600]   the reason I'm gonna get to heaven,
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:07.960]   man, and you're gonna come down afterwards,
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.920]   we're gonna have this same combo.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.640]   So just, I'll make it happen right here.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.880]   We can all have together.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.440]   If the reason you think you'll spend eternity with God
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.240]   is because you're a good person, you're not a Christian.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.480]   That's not what Christianity teaches.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.760]   That's not what Christians believe.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.600]   Let me say it again.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.200]   If you think you'll spend eternity with God
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.920]   because you're a good person, you are not a Christian.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.720]   On the other side, it's true.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.320]   If you think you cannot spend eternity with God,
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.560]   listen to me so closely, man,
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.320]   if you think you can't spend eternity with God
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.900]   because you're a bad person,
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.360]   you don't know what Christianity's about.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:49.040]   The message of Christianity is that all of us are broken,
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.360]   and God sent his son on the cross to die for your sins
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.400]   as a payment for your sin, and he rose back alive.
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.480]   And what that showed us is that the payment cleared,
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.400]   the check cleared, was more than enough.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.920]   That's the message of the gospel.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.840]   That's why we worship in here every single week.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.600]   It's not because we think that we're good people,
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.600]   that we figured it out,
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.720]   and we really have caught on putting ourselves together.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.040]   We come in here every single week,
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.320]   and we worship the only one who ever had it together,
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.560]   the one who loves us in spite of everything wrong with us,
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.840]   who died in our place, who died in your place,
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.480]   not because you deserved it,
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.240]   but because you didn't, and you never could,
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.600]   but because he loved you.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.080]   And you're either gonna trust in the cross of Christ
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.180]   and the work of cross and have true faith,
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:38.760]   or you're gonna buy into the biggest lie
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.760]   this world has ever been told,
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.560]   which is, man, just keep being good.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.340]   God will love you.
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:48.160]   We took those diamonds,
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.840]   and I'll finish the story and land the plane.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:53.280]   We took them back to that, we took them to another jeweler
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.120]   just to make sure like,
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.520]   hey, we shouldn't throw these things out
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.480]   just yet, let's confirm.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.840]   And we had a test done, so we like paid,
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.200]   and hey, send it back and test.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.560]   And here's how they test diamonds.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.840]   They see how strong it is.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.800]   They see how much pressure it can endure.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.880]   In other words, they put it underneath,
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.040]   there's a hardness scale,
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.220]   and if it cracks or it scratches, then it's not a diamond.
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:19.120]   But if it withstands the pressure, then it is.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.560]   And we paid, and they took it away,
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.400]   and they did this test, called us a week later,
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.360]   and they said, "These are real diamonds."
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.400]   Like they stood underneath the pressure, they didn't crack.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.000]   These are real, we were wrong.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.700]   These are genuine, the real thing.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:39.480]   How can I know that I have like genuine, true faith?
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.720]   How can I know that I have the faith
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.280]   that will be able to stand underneath the pressure
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.880]   of this life, of eternity?
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.040]   How can I know that I have true faith?
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.760]   Peter would say, "If you have a faith
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.560]   "that in midst of trials, you press into God,
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.140]   "you don't run from Him."
[00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:02.440]   If you have a faith that's marked by like,
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.200]   "God, I love you, I'm not perfect,
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.240]   "I'm still broken, Lord,
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.780]   "and you're taking ground on my life,
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.260]   "but at the end of the day, I love you,
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.260]   "and I wanna do what you want.
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.020]   "Will you help me, Lord?
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.400]   "And I trust you, God.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.320]   "My joy is found in you,
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.880]   "and perfectly, will you help me?"
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.320]   He says, "That's true faith."
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:22.440]   And if you're someone who has put your faith
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.520]   most importantly, not in what you do,
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.920]   but in the work of Christ on the cross,
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.000]   and His resurrection from the dead,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.720]   you have true faith that will stand
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.760]   in the midst of the eternal fire,
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.380]   and in the midst of the showers or fires
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.560]   of this world and life.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.920]   And pray that we would.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:44.360]   Father, thank you that you don't demand something from us.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.480]   Lord, you did something for us.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.680]   You died in our place, you died in my place.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.560]   Father, would the just truth of the reality of the gospel
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.440]   continue to take ground in my heart,
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.480]   in my friend's heart, for anyone inside of this room
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.920]   who still has bought into the lie
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.160]   that God wants them to earn their way to Him?
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:08.280]   Lord, would the hounds of heaven itself
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.600]   go after the hearts of those people?
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.640]   And would the Spirit of God come and press on them?
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.080]   Would they begin to trust not in what they do
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.440]   or what they haven't done?
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.360]   Maybe despite what they've done,
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.560]   that they would put their faith in Christ alone.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.640]   You died in our place as payment for our sins,
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.320]   and you offer us new life just like you rose again.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.200]   So shall we, God, we worship you now in song.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.400]   We are truly yours, forever yours.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.280]   We worship you because of that.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:46.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
