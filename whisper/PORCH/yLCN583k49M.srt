1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
 My kids are gonna be jealous, man.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,920
 Phil Wickham's the soundtrack of the Stewart House.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,000
 So thank you, brother, for leading us.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Can we just say thank you to Phil again for leading us?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 (congregation cheering)

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Hey, I wanna say thank you to David too,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 and the team for putting this on.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,240
 What an amazing, important time for us to gather together.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,720
 So awesome to be here with you.

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,320
 And if you got a copy of your scriptures with you,

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,560
 we gotta jump right in, folks.

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,880
 We're in Ephesians chapter two.

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,040
 Ephesians chapter two.

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,560
 I wanna read to you a big section of scripture

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,960
 to kind of load it into your mind.

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,960
 We'll pray and then jump into what the Lord has for us today.

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,080
 So Ephesians chapter two.

18
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,880
 If you don't have a copy of your scriptures, just listen.

19
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,800
 I'll read it out loud,

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,720
 and then we'll pray and jump in together.

21
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,560
 But Ephesians two, verse one begins like this.

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,440
 "And you were dead in the trespasses and sins

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,600
 in which you once walked,

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,640
 following the course of this world,

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,840
 following the prince of the power of the air,

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,400
 the spirit that's now at work in the sons of disobedience,

27
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,280
 among whom we all once lived,

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,320
 in the passions of our flesh,

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,680
 carrying out the desires of the flesh,

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,940
 of the body and the mind,

31
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,060
 and were by nature children of wrath

32
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,320
 like the rest of mankind.

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,000
 But God, being rich in mercy,

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,240
 because of the great love with which he loved us,

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,880
 even when we were dead in our trespasses,

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,860
 made us alive together with Christ.

37
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,360
 By grace you've been saved.

38
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,200
 And he raised us up with him and seated us with him

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,740
 in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,

40
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,080
 so that in the coming age,

41
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,320
 he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,000
 and kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 For by grace you have been saved through faith."

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,260
 This is not of yourselves.

45
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,040
 It is a gift of God.

46
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,680
 Not a result of works so that no one may boast,

47
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,800
 for we are his workmanship.

48
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,000
 Created in Christ Jesus for good works,

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,460
 which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in.

50
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,180
 Therefore, remember that at one time,

51
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,040
 you, Gentiles in the flesh,

52
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,400
 called the uncircumcision by what is called

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,800
 the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hand.

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,080
 Remember that you were at that time separated from Christ,

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,160
 alienated from the commonwealth of Israel,

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,920
 strangers to the covenants of promise,

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,120
 having no hope and without God in the world.

58
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,000
 But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far off,

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,360
 have been brought near by the blood of Christ.

60
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,680
 For he himself is our peace, who's made us both one

61
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,440
 and has broken down in his flesh

62
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,200
 the dividing wall of hostility

63
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,920
 by abolishing the law of commandments and ordinances

64
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,700
 that he might create in himself one new man

65
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,200
 in place of the two, so making peace

66
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,440
 and might reconcile us both to God

67
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,000
 in one body through the cross,

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
 thereby killing the hostility.

69
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,000
 He came and preached peace to you who are far off,

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,120
 peace to those who were near.

71
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,680
 Through him, we both have access

72
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,400
 in one spirit to the father.

73
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,160
 So then you're no longer strangers, aliens,

74
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,440
 your fellow citizens with the saints

75
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,520
 and members of the household of God,

76
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,080
 built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,

77
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,760
 Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone

78
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,160
 in whom this whole structure being joined together

79
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,760
 grows into a holy temple in the Lord.

80
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,600
 In him, you are also being built together

81
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,880
 in the dwelling place for God by this spirit.

82
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,640
 You read chapter four, verse one.

83
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,640
 I therefore, a prisoner of the Lord urge you,

84
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,680
 walk in a manner worthy of the calling

85
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,560
 to which you've been called,

86
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,280
 with humility and gentleness, with patience,

87
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,600
 bearing with one another in love,

88
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,720
 eager to maintain the unity of the spirit

89
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,820
 and the bond of peace.

90
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,560
 Well, fathers, we take up this subject

91
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,760
 of what it means to be united in love.

92
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,700
 I just pray at the outset, let it be.

93
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,600
 Let us know what it is to be loved by you.

94
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,080
 And let's take up the high and challenging call

95
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,160
 of loving each other.

96
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,700
 Not hypothetically, propositionally loving people,

97
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,240
 but in a real gritty way, love the people

98
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,080
 to our left and our right.

99
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,480
 The world needs to see it to help us do it.

100
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,960
 And I wanna invite you, if you're willing

101
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,720
 to just take a minute and pray, and you ask him,

102
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,520
 say, God, please teach us tonight.

103
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,640
 And then if you would, please pray for me,

104
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,280
 that the Lord would use me and I'd be helpful to you.

105
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,440
 (silence)

106
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:53,400
 Father, we love you and we trust you.

107
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,140
 Use this time, we pray in Jesus' name, amen.

108
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,880
 Well, when I was right out of college,

109
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,320
 my family decided to take a vacation in Colorado,

110
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,120
 where my brother was living at the time.

111
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,000
 So we flew up there and jumped into his car,

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,160
 threw all our gear in the back and drove up to this resort.

113
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,280
 And I remember as we were getting out of the car,

114
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,080
 I grabbed my bag and was walking through the parking lot

115
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,720
 and my mom asked me a question.

116
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,480
 She said, "Ben, is that your underwear on the ground?"

117
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,120
 And I looked and I was like, "Yes."

118
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,800
 That's odd, and tucked it in and we walked into this hotel.

119
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,240
 And as soon as we walked into the hotel,

120
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,880
 the bottom of my bag flipped open like a lid

121
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,760
 and all my clothes fell out.

122
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,920
 Remember, I was like, "What a cheap bag."

123
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,880
 So I kind of had to grab all my possessions

124
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,640
 and wandered through the lobby holding them.

125
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,600
 And we went up to the room and we decided,

126
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,760
 well, that was a weird start,

127
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,160
 but we were heading out to dinner.

128
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,920
 And at that moment, my brother realized

129
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,200
 he'd forgotten pants.

130
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,560
 So he asked if he could borrow a pair of pants.

131
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,480
 Then I gave him my favorite pair of jeans.

132
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,800
 And we went to dinner.

133
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,920
 I remember as we were walking back, I looked

134
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,820
 and there was a huge rip in them and not a cool one,

135
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,800
 like an awkward, "You ruined them," rip in my pants.

136
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,920
 And I was like, "What have you done?"

137
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,760
 He's like, "I don't know."

138
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,920
 I'm like, "What do you mean you don't know?

139
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,760
 "Take them off."

140
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,840
 And we got to the end of what had become

141
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,040
 a very strange trip.

142
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,560
 But the next morning we were excited.

143
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,400
 We're about to go whitewater rafting together.

144
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,220
 It's very cool.

145
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,140
 And so I remember we got in this boat

146
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,560
 and it was like three of us guys got in with this guide.

147
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,200
 And it didn't take very long down the river

148
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,800
 before he looked at me and my brother and his friend

149
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,680
 and was like, "Hey, you guys seem to know

150
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,640
 "what you're doing out here."

151
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,160
 We're like, "Yeah, what's up, man?"

152
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,960
 He was like, "Hey, do y'all wanna go on some harder rapids?"

153
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,200
 I'm like, "What are you gonna say, no?"

154
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,280
 We were like, "Of course, man, give us all you got."

155
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,120
 And then he gets amped.

156
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,240
 He's like, "Dude, I'd never get to do this.

157
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,120
 "It's gonna be crazy."

158
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,380
 And then he looks up at me and he was like,

159
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,000
 "Hey, man, when we hit that whitewater, I'm looking at you.

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,620
 "And I'm gonna tell you like stroke two

161
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,680
 "and you gotta dig in deep.

162
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,820
 "Everyone's gonna be keying off of you.

163
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,660
 "You got this?"

164
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,480
 I was like, "I got you."

165
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,320
 And he's like, "All right."

166
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,160
 So he's getting ready.

167
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,560
 And I remember as soon as we hit these rapids,

168
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,600
 he yelled, "Stroke two!"

169
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,220
 And as soon as he does,

170
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,660
 it feels like someone's lit a fire in my shorts.

171
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,320
 So he yelled, "Stroke two!"

172
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,440
 Right when I yell, "It burns!"

173
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,720
 And so we hit the rapids.

174
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,800
 I throw my oar down and start scooping water into my lap.

175
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,320
 And he's like, "What are you doing?"

176
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,480
 I'm like, "Make it stop!"

177
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,440
 And we went into the rapids sideways.

178
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,280
 It was chaos.

179
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,680
 He was very upset with me.

180
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,480
 No complimentary photo afterwards.

181
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,140
 But I remember as I was changing,

182
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,860
 I took the wetsuit off and my shorts were frayed

183
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,060
 like an incredible hole.

184
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,600
 I was like, "Man, what is going on?"

185
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,620
 And then finally it struck me.

186
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,780
 I looked at my brother and I said,

187
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,240
 "Hey, man, will you pop the trunk of your car?"

188
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,000
 And he did.

189
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,700
 And sure enough, there was an old car battery in the back.

190
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,860
 And battery acid had leaked into my bag.

191
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,000
 Now, if that's never happened to you before,

192
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,520
 battery acid doesn't necessarily eat all the clothes.

193
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,520
 What it does is it soaks into every fiber and weakens them.

194
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,260
 So that over the course of the next several days,

195
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,280
 as I would button a shirt, a chunk would rip off.

196
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,580
 As I would pull on socks, I'd rip the top off.

197
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,760
 Because this substance had soaked every fiber

198
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,120
 and weakened them so that when it was time for them to move,

199
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,820
 they disintegrated.

200
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,560
 Now, why do I mention that?

201
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,240
 Because I think there are forces today

202
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,880
 that have soaked into our mentality as a culture,

203
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,420
 that have weakened every fiber,

204
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,460
 and we are disintegrating.

205
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,900
 And our relationship with God,

206
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,660
 and our relationship to ourselves,

207
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,500
 and our relationship to other people, and it's a problem.

208
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,140
 Sun Tzu wrote the book "Art of War" centuries ago

209
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,180
 about the seminal book on warfare.

210
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,500
 And what's interesting about "The Art of War"

211
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,940
 is there's very little about what happens

212
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,620
 in the actual battlefield.

213
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,180
 Much of the book is about how to defeat your enemy

214
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,940
 before you even line up at the battle lines.

215
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,540
 And one of the pieces of information he says

216
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,340
 is, "Man, when you're working against a kingdom

217
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,660
 "with superior power, what you have to do is,

218
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,260
 "one, you wanna distract them

219
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,060
 "so allure them with sexual activity or with treasure.

220
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,660
 "And then you wanna send spies among the camp

221
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,180
 "to sow disinformation, to breed distrust,

222
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,020
 "and so that as there's distrust,

223
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,480
 "they will disintegrate within their own kingdom,

224
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,540
 "and so they'll be weakened

225
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,140
 "when the time of battle comes, they're not ready."

226
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,740
 What's fascinating was he wrote that centuries ago,

227
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,260
 but I was talking with leaders in DC where I live now,

228
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,500
 and that playbook has been run by Russia

229
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,540
 against the United States.

230
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,060
 You know, over the last few years,

231
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,060
 they was like, "Yeah, that's what we're going to do.

232
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,660
 "Let's flood the internet with all kinds of disinformation

233
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,780
 "to distort your view of reality."

234
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,540
 And what's interesting is even among Russian troll farms,

235
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,820
 they found that they were actually organizing events

236
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,060
 that took place in America during our election cycle.

237
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,360
 And some of those events were right-wing events,

238
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,900
 and some of them were left-wing events.

239
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,620
 And what was interesting is the FBI agent

240
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,760
 who was interviewed by Congress said,

241
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,580
 "Well, wait a minute, they were organizing

242
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,600
 "left and right-wing events?

243
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,540
 "What side were they trying to win?"

244
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,860
 And the FBI agent said, "No, they weren't picking a side.

245
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,940
 "They just wanted to make us tear each other apart.

246
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,740
 "The goal was disinformation to breed distrust,

247
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,380
 "so we'll disintegrate.

248
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,540
 "Why size up against us if I can get you to destroy yourself?"

249
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,900
 Now, here's the interesting thing is

250
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,060
 I'm actually not that worried about Russia right now.

251
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,340
 I can't solve anything with that,

252
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,340
 and I'm not really worried about

253
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,900
 what they're saying to you politically,

254
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,280
 but what's interesting to me is before Russia ran this play,

255
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,400
 before Sun Tzu ran this play, the devils ran this play.

256
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,780
 You look at Genesis chapter three, and what's he doing?

257
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,540
 Distrust, did God really say, "Eve, hey, Eve,

258
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,620
 "just make an observation.

259
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,180
 "It seems like the God that you worship

260
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,900
 "is holding out on you.

261
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,380
 "It seems like your allegiance to him

262
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,580
 "is costing you some experiences, Eve, I don't know,

263
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,080
 "but something about it says

264
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,440
 "that he's trying to steal real life from you."

265
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,120
 And he begins to sow distrust,

266
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,820
 so she will disintegrate from God.

267
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,580
 And then once he separated us from the head,

268
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,380
 what's Genesis chapter four?

269
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,180
 God warns Cain, "Sin is crouching at your door.

270
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,480
 "It wants to devour you, but rather than make war on sin,

271
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,940
 "Cain makes war on his brother, and he kills him."

272
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,260
 And I look at our culture today,

273
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,940
 and I think there are forces that are calling us

274
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,460
 to disintegrate from God and disintegrate from each other.

275
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,460
 Why take you head on?

276
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,380
 I don't have to.

277
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,280
 I just get you to tear yourself apart.

278
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,740
 And my concern is for us in the middle of a culture

279
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,380
 a country, a society that distrusts each other

280
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,420
 and is disintegrating or ripping apart at the seams.

281
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,860
 My question that I'm burdened with is,

282
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,640
 does the church have an answer?

283
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,820
 What do we say?

284
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,140
 Does our message have any bearing on a culture in crisis?

285
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,780
 'Cause I can't fix America,

286
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,660
 and we don't need to pontificate about that,

287
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,580
 but I'm very concerned about who is the church

288
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,240
 in the middle of a difficult day.

289
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,740
 And what I love about this passage in Ephesians

290
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,780
 is Paul is gonna show us, hey, there's the problem,

291
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,180
 and here's the depths underneath our problem,

292
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,940
 but then he's gonna lead us to the great physician

293
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,300
 and to see the answer.

294
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,620
 And the answer is not something you do.

295
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,740
 What Paul is gonna show us is what Christ has done.

296
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,500
 As he's watched the enemy rip apart his people,

297
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,220
 Christ comes to act decisively.

298
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,700
 And we're gonna get to see the movement of Christ,

299
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,980
 how he handled the unraveling individually,

300
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,700
 and how he handled it corporately.

301
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,780
 And then we're gonna see how we participate in it.

302
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,940
 Sound good?

303
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,340
 So it's a lot of scripture,

304
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,500
 and we won't necessarily get into the details of all of it,

305
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,820
 but I wanna fly over what he's done.

306
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,660
 And he starts with how he's helped you individually.

307
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,420
 And you see in Ephesians 2, it starts with,

308
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,820
 "And you were dead."

309
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,260
 That Paul looks at our dislocation from God as human beings.

310
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,540
 And he said, "We've been so severed from the author of life

311
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,700
 "that when he tries to find a metaphor for it,

312
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,900
 "he goes to the morgue."

313
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,160
 You are so distant from God,

314
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,040
 the best description of your spiritual state is a graveyard.

315
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,060
 And he says, "And we were dead in our trespasses and sins."

316
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,820
 Trespass means you went someplace

317
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,700
 you were never meant to go.

318
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,180
 And sin means you became something

319
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,260
 you were never meant to be.

320
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,260
 The Bible says all of us have sinned

321
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,820
 and fallen short of the glory of God.

322
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,860
 God made us to be something glorious,

323
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,180
 but there's something wrong with us.

324
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,700
 I'm in spiritual conversations all the time with people,

325
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,060
 and you say, "How?"

326
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,180
 'Cause I'm a pastor.

327
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,340
 People ask, "What do you do for a living?"

328
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,700
 I say, "I'm a pastor,"

329
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,200
 which either destroys the conversation immediately,

330
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,580
 or they start asking questions.

331
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,100
 And you know what's fascinating?

332
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,940
 Is I tell all of them,

333
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,180
 "Though you're beautiful in the image of God,

334
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,340
 "you're desperately broken."

335
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,140
 And no one ever disagrees.

336
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,440
 They're not like, "Well, Ben, I don't know.

337
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,980
 "I mean, let me push back on that."

338
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,240
 I see skies of blue and clouds of white.

339
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,660
 I think to myself, "What a wonderful world."

340
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,500
 No one says that.

341
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,140
 (congregation laughing)

342
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,100
 I say, "We're all broken."

343
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,920
 They're like, "Right?"

344
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,600
 And they start giving me examples.

345
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,040
 And I say, "And you're broken."

346
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,120
 And no one pushes back on that.

347
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,960
 They say, "You're right.

348
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,400
 "I don't even understand what I do.

349
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,520
 "We all know something's wrong with us,

350
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,800
 "but we sometimes misdiagnose the need.

351
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,320
 "Maybe I just need to lose a little weight,

352
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,440
 "maybe gain a little weight,

353
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,720
 "maybe read a self-help book."

354
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,700
 And Paul says, "No, man, if you got an upset tummy,

355
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,660
 "you need Tums.

356
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,480
 "If you got a broken leg, you need surgery.

357
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,520
 "If you're dead, you need a miracle."

358
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,700
 And the problem's deeper.

359
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,540
 The disintegration is further.

360
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,700
 You're not alive.

361
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,200
 In which you walked following the course of the world,

362
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,120
 he said, "There's a social element to our sin.

363
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,340
 "There's a sense of when you get all sinners together,

364
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,480
 "more sin begins to mix into each other

365
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,600
 "and integrate and bump into some very ugly ways."

366
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,880
 Whenever you look historically at genocides,

367
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,420
 people perpetrating enormous evil,

368
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,080
 exterminating millions of people like in Nazi Germany.

369
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,920
 Afterwards, in the interviews of people

370
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,160
 that were just normal people

371
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,940
 who in various ways participated,

372
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,740
 they would ask them, "How could you participate

373
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,520
 "in something you knew was morally wrong?"

374
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,840
 And over and over again, the reports come back,

375
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,520
 because everyone was doing it.

376
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,520
 You've all read about the Ash Conformity Experiment

377
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,640
 where they did tests on college students.

378
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,020
 They would show them pictures,

379
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,080
 which line is the longest, A, B, or C,

380
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,520
 and A was clearly the right answer.

381
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,080
 But the trick on the test was that everyone was in on it

382
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,240
 in the room except one kid,

383
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,080
 and so everyone in the room would clearly pick a shorter one.

384
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,120
 And you'd watch these kids,

385
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,400
 if you've never watched the videos,

386
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,520
 look around like, "What?

387
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,480
 "No, it's A, right guys, right guys, nobody?"

388
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,620
 And over time, as that consistently happened,

389
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,140
 you'd watch them slump in their chair

390
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,660
 and look down, look exhausted,

391
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,500
 until finally 75% of them would give answers

392
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,540
 they knew were wrong.

393
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,260
 Which circle's red?

394
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,220
 Oh, the blue one.

395
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:47,860
 The push of peer pressure so strong,

396
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,540
 some good self-wisdom you could have

397
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,900
 is knowing how it gets you.

398
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,500
 We followed the Prince of the Power of the Air.

399
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,260
 There's a spiritual element to it.

400
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,740
 I read two books a few years ago,

401
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,260
 people who came to believe in God,

402
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,160
 not because they contemplated the beauty of the world,

403
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,500
 but because they saw the darkness in it.

404
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,100
 And it was more than just biology to them.

405
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,500
 There's something dehumanizing us

406
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,600
 that lets us be so inhumane to each other.

407
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,680
 And then there's a personal element,

408
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,100
 among whom we all lived with the passions of our flesh,

409
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,340
 carrying out the desires of the body, that's the impulse.

410
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,860
 I wanted to see that, so I clicked on it.

411
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,340
 I wanted to touch that, so I did it.

412
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,380
 It's the impulse and the desires of the mind.

413
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,100
 I thought about it.

414
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,820
 I knew that would hurt that person's feelings,

415
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,160
 and I posted it anyway.

416
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,060
 Some of it's impulsive, some of it's deliberate,

417
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,900
 but all of it is death, and we are by nature

418
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,700
 children of wrath like the rest of mankind.

419
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,500
 God is furious when he sees what we've done with the world,

420
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,620
 and I don't blame him.

421
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,580
 And you know, in centuries in the past,

422
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,960
 or centuries years ago, I remember it was kind of awkward

423
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,300
 to talk about wrath.

424
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,920
 I think people get wrath now.

425
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,720
 It's the proper response to injustice.

426
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,780
 Like I remember for me, when I was a little kid,

427
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:01,220
 going with my father to visit my grandma in the hospital,

428
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,300
 and, or in this nursing home, rather,

429
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,380
 and we showed up and we heard screaming

430
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,660
 when we walked through the door.

431
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,100
 And I remember when we turned the corner,

432
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,500
 we saw the screaming was coming from my grandma.

433
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,220
 They had tied her to a chair in the hallway and left her,

434
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,020
 and she was slumped down and she was screaming, it hurts.

435
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,740
 I'll never forget as a young man, looking at my father,

436
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,540
 who was a gentle man, never yelled,

437
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,620
 but I looked at his face and I saw his arms

438
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,100
 and I saw wrath.

439
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,220
 I saw fury in that man, because you had one job,

440
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,540
 take care of her, and you didn't do it.

441
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,700
 You did the opposite of that.

442
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,660
 And who are you mad at?

443
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,460
 The person who tied her to the chair,

444
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,100
 or all the people who walked down the hall in indifference?

445
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,780
 Both.

446
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,740
 And God looks down at the earth he gave us.

447
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,580
 Can you imagine if you had an estate to hand to people

448
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:59,100
 and they abused a third of them and misused the funds?

449
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,060
 You'd be furious.

450
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,820
 And God looks at the world and said, man,

451
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,980
 I called you to love each other

452
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,180
 and look what you've done to each other.

453
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,060
 He's furious at it.

454
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:11,220
 And we're all children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.

455
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,580
 And I know some of us in here say, Ben, I'm not that bad.

456
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,780
 And let me tell you something.

457
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,380
 There's three dead people that Jesus raised

458
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,820
 from the dead in the gospels.

459
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,740
 Jairus' daughter that had died minutes before Jesus arrived.

460
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,180
 The young man who Jesus stopped his funeral,

461
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,060
 literally stopped the funeral beer

462
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,900
 and raised him from the dead.

463
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,500
 And Lazarus, who Jesus waited for days

464
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,300
 before he raised him from the dead.

465
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,380
 All three of them, he raised from the dead.

466
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,300
 The little girl probably looked like she was sleeping,

467
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,220
 probably still warm.

468
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,580
 She had just been dead for minutes.

469
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,060
 Young man had probably been dead a day.

470
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,660
 Body was probably already stiff.

471
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,700
 Lazarus had been in the tomb for days.

472
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,140
 So when Jesus showed up, he said, roll the stone away.

473
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,340
 Mary and Martha went, whoa, whoa, whoa, Jesus, hey,

474
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,340
 he's gonna stink.

475
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,380
 That's the stench of decomposition.

476
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,380
 But here's the interesting thing.

477
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,740
 All three of them, very different.

478
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,340
 Warm, a little stiff, stench.

479
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,740
 But what did they have in common?

480
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,780
 They're all dead.

481
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,780
 It wasn't that he was all dead and she was mostly dead.

482
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,820
 No, they're all dead.

483
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,140
 Just the manifestation of that death looked different.

484
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,340
 So some of us may say, man, I'm not as bad as that guy.

485
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,540
 I don't stink like that person.

486
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,980
 You're right, but you're still dead.

487
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,300
 Like the rest of humanity.

488
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,380
 We're all in a difficult place.

489
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,300
 And unless God does something about it, we can't get out.

490
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,740
 I've told this story a lot in here, but it bears repeating.

491
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,820
 When I was a child, my grandmother had a pool

492
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,900
 in her backyard that years before had been emptied of water,

493
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,980
 emptied of pool water.

494
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,260
 Over the course of years, it had filled with rainwater

495
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,860
 and trees had fallen in it, grass.

496
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,300
 There were snakes in there and frogs.

497
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,580
 And when you're a little kid with a vivid imagination,

498
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,020
 all things evil in the world.

499
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,980
 So if you have a grandma with a pool of evil

500
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,580
 in the backyard, what do you do?

501
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,380
 You play on the edge of it.

502
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,380
 That's what my brother and I would do.

503
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,300
 We'd just go walk in the edge.

504
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,940
 We were like, I can't even stand it.

505
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,380
 All right, walk along.

506
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,100
 Until one day I slipped and I fell in.

507
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,380
 And at that moment, it dawned on me immediately.

508
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,900
 I have to get out of this situation.

509
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,140
 So I waded over to the shallow end.

510
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,900
 I began to run as fast as I could.

511
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,340
 And I went for the leap to try to get myself out.

512
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,740
 I didn't come close.

513
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,500
 I don't know who dug out that pool, but he was motivated.

514
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,820
 I remember I looked up at my brother,

515
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,940
 who's just a year older than me.

516
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,780
 And I'm like, "Ugh."

517
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,620
 And he's like, "Ugh."

518
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,440
 And I'm like, "Ugh!"

519
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,700
 'Cause I realized I can't get out and he can't help me.

520
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,020
 So I did the only thing that was available to me

521
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,580
 at the time, I started crying.

522
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,660
 And I remember as a little five-year-old,

523
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,860
 I'm crying in a pretty terrifying place to me.

524
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,660
 And as I'm doing that, I look through the fence

525
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,780
 and I see a guy that's maybe college age.

526
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,820
 And I see him right as he hears me crying.

527
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,860
 And I watch him drop whatever gardening tool he had.

528
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,060
 And he just started to run.

529
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,700
 And I remember when he got to that fence,

530
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,500
 he just leapt it all in one move.

531
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,900
 It was the coolest thing I'd ever seen.

532
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,340
 And we're all like, "Oh, okay, that was amazing."

533
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,340
 (congregation laughing)

534
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,180
 And he dove into that pool with me and he drew me out.

535
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,420
 It was one of my clearest memories as a child.

536
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,820
 I remember being a little kid, him leaning over

537
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,220
 and looking into my face and saying, "Are you okay, son?"

538
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,540
 And I couldn't answer him.

539
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:44,420
 I was awestruck by the one who would dive into my chaos

540
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,060
 to set me free.

541
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,540
 And Paul here says, "You were dead,

542
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,860
 but God, being rich in mercy,

543
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,060
 because of the great love with which he loved us."

544
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,020
 Not 'cause of what you did,

545
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,940
 but because of what is housed in him,

546
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,260
 because of that great love, even when you were dead,

547
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,660
 he made you alive with Christ.

548
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,660
 By grace, you've been saved.

549
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,300
 And he raised us with him and seated us with him

550
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,580
 in the heavenly places.

551
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,300
 The Bible is not about making bad people good.

552
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,540
 It's about making dead people alive.

553
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,900
 That Jesus Christ united you in his love.

554
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,460
 He saw the disintegration of our relationship with God

555
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,980
 and Jesus Christ reweaved that relationship.

556
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,820
 How did he do it?

557
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,220
 'Cause there's a vertical beam to this cross.

558
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,460
 He took down the thread of love

559
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,420
 and said, "I'm binding you with me."

560
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,900
 That's what's so great about the language.

561
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,980
 Did you notice three times, "With him, with him, with him."

562
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,460
 You were dead, dead, dead in Adam,

563
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,060
 but you are now raised with me and seated with me,

564
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,540
 alive with me, knit together with Christ.

565
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,580
 You have a future and a hope in him

566
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,220
 because it's by grace, his kindness and compassion,

567
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,580
 you've been rescued.

568
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,700
 Not a result of work so that nobody can boast.

569
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,100
 This is our great message.

570
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,380
 This is the hope of the world

571
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,300
 that we've been rescued by a God

572
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,380
 who has united us with his love.

573
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,780
 Not because of what you've done,

574
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,460
 but because of what he did.

575
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,740
 So that in the ages to come,

576
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,260
 we can be a trophy of his grace,

577
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,060
 the kind of love that could change you from the inside out

578
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,020
 and make you in verse 10, his workmanship.

579
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,780
 Created in Christ Jesus for good works,

580
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,660
 which God has prepared for you beforehand,

581
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,180
 that you would walk in him.

582
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,140
 In an anxious and fractured day,

583
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,780
 he has made you something new.

584
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,100
 There's a dignity and a stability to this.

585
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,500
 It's fascinating.

586
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,900
 Michelangelo's David,

587
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,820
 one of the most famous statues in the world.

588
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,940
 And if you've never gone to see it,

589
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,540
 you'll wait for hours in line

590
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,140
 with people from around the world

591
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,060
 to go into a museum

592
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,140
 that really doesn't have much else except David.

593
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,780
 The whole museum was built for that statue.

594
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,700
 But what most people don't know is

595
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,300
 that statue was initially a discarded stone.

596
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,300
 Many other artists had passed it by.

597
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,220
 And then Michelangelo chose it, carved it,

598
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,940
 and made one of the greatest masterpieces

599
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,060
 humanity's ever produced.

600
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,460
 It's insane if you've never looked at it.

601
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,500
 You expect this marble to move.

602
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,380
 It's a lifelike.

603
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,140
 Now, if stone could think,

604
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:26,540
 it would be dumb for David to stand up there and think,

605
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,380
 I'm just a discarded stone.

606
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,620
 (congregation laughing)

607
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,620
 So many have passed over me

608
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,820
 because I'm flawed deep inside.

609
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,460
 You'd say, yeah, all that's true.

610
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,540
 But then the master put his hand on you

611
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,140
 and he's made you something else.

612
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:55,180
 But it'd be equally stupid for David to stand there and say,

613
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,500
 I am David.

614
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,460
 (congregation laughing)

615
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,340
 Drink it in.

616
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,340
 I carved myself out of that stone.

617
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,980
 I chiseled these abs.

618
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,180
 You'd say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

619
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,980
 Now, you are impressive, but you didn't do that.

620
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,380
 You're something beautiful

621
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,220
 because the master put his hands to you.

622
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,140
 You see the beauty of the gospel?

623
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,460
 It makes us humble and confident at the same time.

624
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,980
 That you can come and say, man, I am something great.

625
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,940
 You're not destined by your flaws.

626
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,460
 They don't have to determine your future.

627
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,100
 You've been made something else.

628
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,940
 Why?

629
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,660
 Because the master knit you together with him.

630
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,980
 You are something else.

631
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,820
 You've been united with him in love.

632
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,660
 You see it?

633
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,220
 And he set out your itinerary

634
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,100
 that we would now step into good works

635
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,380
 that he's prepared for us.

636
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,220
 Now, most people when they preach stop here

637
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,620
 because 10 verses is a lot and that's a good place to stop.

638
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,340
 Paul doesn't and so we don't either.

639
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:03,700
 Paul goes from what's a really good landing point.

640
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,060
 You're a masterpiece and bring out the band

641
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,220
 and we sing about how a masterpiece I am.

642
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,420
 Paul goes back down and says,

643
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,140
 therefore in light of this,

644
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,740
 remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh.

645
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,980
 Gentile is the word ethnos.

646
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,380
 It's the non-Jewish people in the audience.

647
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,100
 He looks at everyone from the nations

648
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,300
 that are diverse ethnically

649
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,780
 and he brings up a source of tension.

650
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:34,420
 He says, therefore remember that one time you Gentiles

651
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,580
 in the flesh and not just a source of tension

652
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,540
 called the uncircumcision by what is called

653
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,540
 the circumcision.

654
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,500
 Now that's awkward.

655
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,220
 Why does he bring up whether or not you're circumcised?

656
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,260
 That's weird and who would call you that?

657
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,700
 Well, for the Jewish people,

658
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,300
 circumcision was a sign of a covenant with God

659
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,380
 that God has bound himself with us

660
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,460
 and they were meant to be a kingdom of priests

661
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,260
 helping other people know the God

662
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,100
 who had chosen them by his grace.

663
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,500
 But rather than using that graceful position to love others,

664
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,460
 they were using it to lord over others.

665
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,900
 And he says, so they're looking at you

666
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,740
 and calling you the uncircumcision,

667
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,100
 meaning God doesn't like you as much

668
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,180
 because of the nature of your ethnicity.

669
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,900
 It's a racial slur

670
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:19,660
 and it's got cultural baggage and religious baggage.

671
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,900
 And Paul brings up a really awkward subject.

672
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,740
 This one's great.

673
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,420
 This is getting weird.

674
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,180
 The gospel gets me to heaven,

675
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,020
 but we're ripping each other apart.

676
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,220
 We're not just disintegrated here,

677
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,900
 we're disintegrated here.

678
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,260
 And does the Bible have anything to say

679
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,980
 about how we're culturally ripping each other apart

680
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,660
 because there's all kinds of issues brought up here.

681
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,620
 And Paul keeps pressing on me and keeps making it weird.

682
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,420
 Remember that you were separated from Christ.

683
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,700
 You had no messianic hope,

684
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,620
 alienated from the Commonwealth of Israel.

685
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,300
 There's some national issues here.

686
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,260
 Strangers to the covenant is a promise.

687
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,100
 You didn't even know the words of God.

688
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,580
 And so you had no hope of a future

689
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,700
 without God in the world.

690
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,540
 He's bringing up all these tensions

691
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,420
 that for the Jewish people,

692
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,940
 Gentile was an oppressor, I mean,

693
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,340
 through their whole life,

694
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,340
 back from Pharaoh to Babylon to Persia to Rome.

695
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,260
 So there were religious implications,

696
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,620
 but political implications, social implications,

697
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,740
 religious implications, ethnic ones,

698
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,940
 all kinds of barriers.

699
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,500
 I know it's hard to imagine a time in history

700
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,580
 where people were divided along all these lines.

701
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,340
 Just try to imagine by faith.

702
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:36,100
 Do we have a message that has anything to say here?

703
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,940
 But now in Christ Jesus,

704
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,380
 you who were once far off have been brought near

705
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,580
 by the blood of Christ.

706
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,180
 For he himself is our peace.

707
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,300
 This isn't internal peace,

708
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,860
 it's talking about us.

709
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,300
 He's our peace, how?

710
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,420
 'Cause he broke down in his flesh

711
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,500
 the dividing wall of hostility

712
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,020
 by abolishing the law of commandments,

713
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,260
 expressing ordinances that he might create in himself

714
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,700
 one new man in place of the two.

715
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,700
 So making peace and might reconcile us both to God

716
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,340
 in one body through the cross

717
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,020
 thereby killing the hostility.

718
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,140
 That's the power of the cross.

719
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,300
 I love the way my friend Derwin Gray says it.

720
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,180
 The cross has a vertical beam

721
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,060
 that I can be reconciled to God.

722
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,860
 And it has a horizontal beam

723
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,620
 that I can be reconciled to you.

724
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,140
 The cross is so powerful.

725
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,020
 It can make dead people alive.

726
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,660
 And the cross is so powerful.

727
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,660
 It can turn former hostility into family.

728
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,220
 That's the power of the cross.

729
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,900
 That we can be united with God in love.

730
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,620
 And we can be united with each other in love.

731
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,860
 The cross of Jesus Christ is sufficient

732
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,620
 to make the dead alive and to make enemies into family.

733
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,700
 It's that powerful.

734
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,660
 How did he do it?

735
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,020
 Through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.

736
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,980
 That in the old Jewish temple, there was a wall.

737
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,020
 Jews could come towards the Holy of Holies

738
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,260
 into the inner sanctum.

739
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,020
 Gentiles could not.

740
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,700
 But he says, Christ didn't just reconcile us to God.

741
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,660
 He broke down that wall, made the two one.

742
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,980
 And now we're reconciled together as one body

743
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,540
 because of his cross.

744
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,840
 There's level ground at the foot of the cross.

745
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,620
 I remember for me, when I first started as a pastor

746
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,660
 right out of college, I was involved in a church

747
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,060
 that did communion where everyone comes down front

748
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,580
 and you'd get break off a piece of the bread

749
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,140
 and you'd dip it in the juice and then eat it.

750
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,220
 I had never been a part of a church.

751
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,700
 I wasn't part of the ones that handed out

752
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,700
 little individual cups of the body of Christ

753
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,540
 and blood of Christ.

754
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,980
 And he would sort of not look at anyone else

755
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,820
 or make eye contact.

756
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,580
 I'm having a moment with my individually wrapped

757
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,300
 body of Christ, blood of Christ.

758
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,180
 Y'all stay over there.

759
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,980
 And so it was the first time it was like this communal thing.

760
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,060
 I thought it was weird at first.

761
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,900
 I wasn't sure.

762
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,380
 And actually, I don't know if we'll ever go back

763
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,340
 to sharing bread again.

764
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,500
 Not up in DC, bleh, spook people.

765
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,020
 But back there, I remember staying up there.

766
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,740
 My job was to hold the bread and say,

767
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,220
 the body of Christ was broken for you.

768
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,500
 The body of Christ was broken for you.

769
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,340
 That was my job.

770
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,380
 And someone else said, the blood of Christ

771
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,020
 was shed for you.

772
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,000
 I remember doing that and I remember this old man

773
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,900
 coming down front.

774
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,460
 This old man had done a lot of impressive things.

775
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,060
 I knew his story, but he still needed this.

776
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,860
 I told him, the body of Christ has been broken for you.

777
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,220
 Then I remember this little girl walked up,

778
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,180
 had to kneel down.

779
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,580
 Like, and the body of Christ was broken for you.

780
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,940
 I watched this sweet old Hispanic grandma come up.

781
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,660
 She said, the body of Christ is broken for you.

782
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,660
 Saw a strong young black man come up.

783
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,140
 Body of Christ is broken for you.

784
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,980
 I stood there and I was getting overwhelmed by it.

785
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,020
 I'm like, is there something sufficient

786
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,180
 to unite us together in a divided day?

787
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,540
 Can something reweave the fabric

788
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,460
 that's being disintegrated in society?

789
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,140
 Yes, it's not something new, it's something old.

790
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,780
 It worked back then, it works now.

791
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,460
 That the cross kills the hostility,

792
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,460
 that we can be united in love with him

793
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,380
 and united in love with each other.

794
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,860
 That's the possibility open to us.

795
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,260
 For through him, we both have access in one spirit

796
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,140
 to the Father, which is beautiful, but not easy.

797
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,900
 So chapter three, Paul takes an aside

798
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,940
 and talks about how God called him to the Gentiles.

799
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,740
 And then he gets back on track 'cause he said,

800
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,180
 hey, I've been called you to walk

801
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,220
 in these good works that he called you to walk in.

802
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,060
 And he picks that up in chapter four, verse one.

803
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,220
 He says, I therefore, as a prisoner urge you,

804
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,780
 walk in a manner worthy of the calling

805
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,220
 with which you've been called.

806
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,500
 With all humility and gentleness and patience,

807
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,620
 bearing with one another in love,

808
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,620
 eager to maintain the unity of the spirit

809
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,300
 and the bond of peace.

810
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,500
 He says, man, now that God has reconciled you to himself,

811
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,100
 I want you to walk in good works.

812
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,700
 And he says, what are they?

813
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,060
 He said, well, he's taking people who are very different.

814
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,860
 And I want you to walk in a manner worthy of the gospel.

815
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,980
 What is that?

816
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,020
 I want you to bear with one another.

817
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,540
 In the Greek, that means put up with each other.

818
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,380
 Which you think he would say something more impressive.

819
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,700
 Christ bled out a drops of blood, so go to the nations.

820
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,580
 Now, what does he say?

821
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,060
 Christ bled out for you, so what?

822
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,700
 So put up with each, just put up with each other.

823
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:16,700
 Be gentle, be patient, bear with each other

824
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,740
 because you'll misunderstand each other constantly.

825
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,860
 But be eager to maintain the unity of the spirit

826
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,700
 and the bond of peace.

827
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,060
 Does that describe you at all?

828
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,100
 We put your social media up on the screen.

829
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,460
 Would it look like eagerness to maintain the unity

830
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,980
 of the spirit and the bond of peace?

831
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,940
 There's a lot of motivations in the world to tear us apart.

832
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,940
 And there's real issues and real division.

833
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,180
 But we have the possibility of being woven together

834
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,220
 to bear with one another in love.

835
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,060
 Why?

836
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,780
 Because we have the inexhaustible resource of God's love.

837
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:56,300
 My wife and I love each other.

838
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,260
 And it's pretty amazing that you can love somebody

839
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,540
 and you build this family that didn't exist before.

840
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,580
 And that the outworking of that love

841
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,900
 can actually produce people.

842
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,860
 Don't go too deep into the metaphor, but it's pretty fun.

843
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,940
 So, but you look and when you bring these humans

844
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,660
 into the world, you're like, we built this relationship

845
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,220
 and you are a product of our love for each other.

846
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,460
 That's so crazy.

847
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,660
 And I remember when my daughter Sparrow was born,

848
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:27,780
 the instant she was born, she was ours, mine,

849
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,140
 forever loved by me.

850
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:35,140
 But she was also instantly sister to Hannah

851
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,940
 and one of the greatest hopes as parents

852
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,340
 that we plead with them is get along.

853
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:52,300
 Let this love transfer here, not just here, but here.

854
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:57,260
 I want it to move amongst each other.

855
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,420
 Can we do that?

856
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:02,180
 Is it possible to be united with him in love

857
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,460
 and united with each other,

858
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,820
 bearing with one another in love,

859
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,980
 eager to maintain the unity of the spirit

860
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,060
 and the bond of peace?

861
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,260
 That what the spirit procured, we preserve.

862
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,740
 What Christ purchased, we preserve.

863
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,940
 We fight for this unity because the world needs to see it.

864
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,780
 And let me tell you something,

865
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,020
 if I can get in your business a little bit.

866
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,620
 Today, if you're millennial or Gen Z, statistically speaking,

867
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,180
 depending on how the question's asked,

868
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,300
 somewhere between 25 to 35% of your generations

869
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,060
 say they're unaffiliated with any religion.

870
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,300
 Yet interestingly, in the same surveys,

871
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,620
 when they're asked, how often do you pray

872
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,180
 and do you believe in heaven, hell, and miracles,

873
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,060
 the same number roughly as previous generations

874
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,180
 indicate that they do.

875
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,580
 It's confusing.

876
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,660
 So wait a minute, you're less religious,

877
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,260
 but you roughly believe the same things

878
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,700
 and pray about the same amount of time?

879
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,820
 What's the difference?

880
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,300
 Well, the difference is that word unaffiliated.

881
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,860
 It means not part of a group.

882
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,700
 And what you see happening a lot in the world today

883
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,660
 is not that I'm less interested in spirituality

884
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,020
 or less pursuing of spirituality,

885
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,140
 it's just that I'm less interested

886
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,580
 in the affiliations with other people.

887
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,260
 Dr. Gene Twenge did a study on it

888
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,860
 on your generations and has found that

889
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,420
 where a sense of individualism is high,

890
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,500
 the prioritizing of self, religious involvement is low

891
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,020
 because it involves commitment to a group.

892
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,380
 So you see the rise of this language,

893
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,060
 I'm spiritual, but not religious.

894
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,900
 What does it mean?

895
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,100
 It means I wanna acknowledge there's a spiritual world.

896
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,940
 I believe there's more than just biology.

897
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,700
 I wanna be a part of something out there,

898
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,780
 but I don't want the hassle of you.

899
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,500
 And so you see, it's not an anti-spiritual movement

900
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,540
 in your generation, it's anti-social.

901
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,660
 It's I wanna love God,

902
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,780
 but I don't want the hassle of you people.

903
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,660
 And listen, I'm not giving you a hard time

904
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,540
 because this is a trend in America you were born up to.

905
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,820
 The number of people that you can call in a crisis

906
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,420
 has been decreasing in America since the 1950s.

907
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,300
 So you're part of an anti-social movement

908
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,500
 that's been happening in America for a long time.

909
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,380
 As our square footage of our homes has grown,

910
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,820
 the square footage of our friendship groups have shrunk.

911
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,540
 And a lot of that is because of these phones

912
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,420
 and you didn't make them,

913
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,260
 they were put in your hand as babies.

914
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,780
 But the more we're brought onto this,

915
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,580
 you see a marked decrease in empathy in your generations

916
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,860
 because I can be rude to you

917
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,340
 and not have to look at the pain in your face.

918
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,060
 And so there's an anti-social movement in society,

919
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,780
 but it's interesting, Huffington Post,

920
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,820
 which is by no means a conservative or religious publication

921
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,580
 released a study by UCLA,

922
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,380
 which is in no way a religious institution,

923
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,780
 but they study college students, your generation,

924
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,220
 over 200 universities,

925
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,060
 and they were looking for what are the major trends

926
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,380
 in college students over the decades.

927
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,940
 And do you know what they found the major trends are?

928
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,140
 College students are less religious,

929
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,220
 not surprising, we just said that.

930
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,300
 And it says, but college students are also more lonely,

931
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,140
 depressed, and stressed than any generation previously,

932
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,060
 by a wide margin.

933
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,140
 And so the third trend they're seeing

934
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,140
 is they need to offer more drug treatment

935
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,580
 because addiction is an intimacy disorder.

936
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,740
 If I can't find my needs met with another human being,

937
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,740
 then I go to try to regulate my chemicals of the substance.

938
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,180
 You see?

939
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,020
 And there's an increasing amount of responsibility

940
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,860
 for colleges to try to police sexual violence.

941
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,820
 As you see among your generation,

942
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,620
 there's been not a lack of interest in spirituality,

943
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,540
 but a weakening of the fabric socially.

944
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,820
 And what's it done?

945
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,900
 You've all seen that study.

946
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,180
 Every pastor's quoted it.

947
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,460
 So let me just get it out of the way.

948
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,820
 They did a study recently in Barna, right?

949
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,820
 Across America throughout the pandemic,

950
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,060
 everyone's mental health went down, except one group.

951
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,740
 Those who went to church on a weekly basis,

952
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,500
 not every now and again, weekly,

953
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,420
 said, I'm gonna prioritize what Christ purchased.

954
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,860
 I'm united with Him, so I'm united with us.

955
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,420
 And what the statistics are showing us

956
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,140
 is what Genesis says is haunting.

957
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,100
 It's not good for a man to be alone.

958
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,700
 One of the greatest gifts God has given us is us.

959
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,340
 I'm united with Him.

960
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,140
 And then he says, but I didn't stop there.

961
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,260
 I also united you with us.

962
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,540
 So be eager to maintain this bond of unity

963
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,380
 and this bond of the Spirit in peace,

964
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,540
 because it's difficult, but it's worth it and you need it.

965
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,700
 So let me give you two implications before we close.

966
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,140
 'Cause some of you are like, Ben, why would I bother?

967
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,740
 Like, why do I wanna fight for this?

968
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,860
 Why do I wanna fight for unity?

969
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,500
 Like, I have my friendship group.

970
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,220
 All I need is a couple buddies

971
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,580
 and some podcasts and some books and I'm good.

972
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,580
 Jesus here is talking about,

973
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,060
 I made strangers and enemies into family.

974
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,060
 Why?

975
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,860
 Because the unity of diversity brings glory.

976
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,380
 It does.

977
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,700
 Give you a simple example.

978
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,620
 If I came to you and said,

979
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,340
 hey man, you gotta listen to this song.

980
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,300
 And you said, why?

981
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,140
 And I was like, dude, it is a hit

982
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,740
 among 13 year old white girls.

983
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,740
 They love it.

984
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,660
 You probably don't care.

985
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,660
 Like, dude, I wanna hear this song.

986
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,900
 But if I said to you, dude, you gotta hear this song.

987
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,740
 You're like, why?

988
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,900
 Because this is the number one song

989
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,940
 in every country on planet earth.

990
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,940
 Across age demographics, social economic boundaries,

991
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,700
 this song is the number one song in the minds and hearts

992
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,180
 of people from all different ethnicities and ages

993
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,660
 and social and economic backgrounds,

994
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,740
 all across the planet, all keen off this song.

995
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,900
 You'd go, play me the song.

996
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,980
 What could possibly unite people like that?

997
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,300
 The unity of diversity brings glory.

998
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,220
 I gotta hear it.

999
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,700
 If I said, try this restaurant.

1000
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,460
 It's a hit with the over 75 set.

1001
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,780
 I mean, the grandparents love it.

1002
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,100
 You're probably not gonna go.

1003
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,100
 But if I say everyone wants to go there,

1004
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,460
 you wanna know what they're serving.

1005
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,380
 The unity of diversity brings glory.

1006
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,340
 It is no great glory for you to love your friends.

1007
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,180
 That's what Jesus said.

1008
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,180
 He said, love your enemies.

1009
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,220
 Pray for those who persecute you.

1010
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,420
 He said, you love your friends?

1011
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,940
 Even the sinners do that.

1012
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,580
 Even Hitler probably had friends.

1013
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,420
 I love my friends.

1014
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,380
 Who cares?

1015
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,860
 But people see the glory of God

1016
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,740
 when they see people across boundaries,

1017
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,940
 when they see love explode past the expected banks,

1018
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,900
 it brings glory.

1019
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,580
 When they walk into a church building

1020
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,620
 and they see you all here,

1021
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:03,700
 and say, hey, there's old people here and young people here.

1022
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,340
 Hey, there's black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Latino.

1023
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,380
 Everybody's here.

1024
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,580
 What could do that?

1025
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,780
 There's only two entities in America,

1026
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,580
 the Department of Motor Vehicles.

1027
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,380
 (congregation laughing)

1028
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,220
 And there's something to it.

1029
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,820
 Everyone knows they're guilty.

1030
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,100
 Yeah, yeah.

1031
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,460
 We all stand condemned.

1032
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,060
 And the church of Jesus Christ.

1033
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,580
 And this one's way more fun.

1034
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,140
 (congregation applauding)

1035
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,540
 That people are meant to walk in among us

1036
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,620
 and say, what can do this?

1037
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,820
 What could unite a people like this?

1038
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,220
 What could do this?

1039
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,660
 We say the cross is that powerful,

1040
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,300
 that it not only brings the dead to life,

1041
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,820
 it makes former enemies, it makes them family.

1042
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:53,580
 So we do it for his glory and we do it for his good.

1043
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,460
 We do it for our good.

1044
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,580
 But we need us.

1045
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,500
 It's interesting, man, 'cause you all believe this anyway.

1046
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,980
 I mean, you look in like the Iron Man movie

1047
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,340
 made maybe $300 million.

1048
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,060
 The Avengers made multiple billion.

1049
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,180
 Would it be billion dollars, right?

1050
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,180
 Why?

1051
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,980
 Because we wanna see people who are formerly disparate

1052
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,540
 come together to solve a problem, right?

1053
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,700
 How many times have you watched that movie?

1054
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,900
 Over and over again.

1055
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,780
 Lord of the Rings and the Avengers

1056
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,220
 and Justice League, no, it's good.

1057
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,140
 But you go to those movies all the time.

1058
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,580
 I wanna see people who have no business getting along

1059
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,860
 and don't really like each other

1060
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,660
 suddenly have a purpose bigger than themselves

1061
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,620
 that they have to unite about

1062
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,780
 and they overcome their differences

1063
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,140
 and found that our unity doesn't actually detract from me.

1064
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,580
 Actually, as I work through our differences,

1065
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,980
 it enriches me 'cause I get to be a part

1066
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,340
 of something bigger than myself.

1067
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,780
 And we go, yes, that's right.

1068
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,140
 That is just stealing a little piece

1069
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,220
 of what Jesus is doing right.

1070
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,060
 Man, I don't wanna do that

1071
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:44,980
 'cause I don't get along with that guy.

1072
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,020
 I don't understand him.

1073
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,500
 You want this.

1074
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,940
 You're built for this.

1075
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,420
 It's for God's glory and it's for your good.

1076
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,340
 I love it.

1077
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,460
 We didn't get a chance to read it,

1078
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,540
 but he says, "When we speak the truth to one another in love,

1079
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,300
 "we will in all things grow into the head."

1080
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,980
 That is we lean into preserving this unity

1081
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,780
 and speak the truth to each other, you grow.

1082
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,900
 This is for your good.

1083
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:13,580
 It's interesting, match.com is an old school dating site.

1084
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,260
 And they developed an algorithm

1085
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,820
 of you punch in the characteristics that you like

1086
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,180
 and we'll spit out your first date

1087
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,900
 and you guys should get married, you're a match.

1088
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,620
 And they found that it like never worked.

1089
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:28,660
 Like people barely ever made it out of the first date.

1090
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,860
 And so they hired a guy to understand

1091
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,900
 what's wrong with our algorithm.

1092
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,300
 Why does our algorithm work?

1093
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,580
 And what they found was there's nothing wrong

1094
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,260
 with the algorithm.

1095
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,540
 The problem is people.

1096
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:42,580
 What they say they want and who they marry

1097
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,660
 are so wildly disparate.

1098
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,500
 There's no correlation.

1099
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,180
 And it's funny when I talk to people that are like,

1100
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,580
 well, Ben, I don't need to go to church.

1101
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,740
 I got my friends, my podcast, my books.

1102
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,340
 That betrays the assumption

1103
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:00,900
 that you actually know what you want and you don't.

1104
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:05,180
 But the spirit apportions gifts for the common good.

1105
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,740
 He scattered them among an us and you need an us.

1106
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:13,540
 I had no idea when I was 20 how selfish I was

1107
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,820
 till I got involved at a church

1108
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,980
 and started serving among junior high kids.

1109
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,220
 And I would speak and they're not listening.

1110
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,420
 And I'm like, why are you not listening to this?

1111
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,260
 This is good.

1112
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,100
 Like, why are you not?

1113
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:23,940
 Other people want to hear this.

1114
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:24,780
 I don't need this.

1115
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,620
 I don't need y'all.

1116
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,460
 I don't need this.

1117
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,740
 And I realized I'm so selfish.

1118
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,220
 I have no idea.

1119
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,420
 But I'll never forget the day

1120
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,020
 one of them walked into the church early

1121
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,100
 and asked, how are you doing, man?

1122
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,020
 He was like, fine.

1123
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:39,740
 But I knew his parents had just divorced.

1124
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:43,620
 And I knew he was helping dad move into his apartment

1125
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,460
 that week.

1126
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,780
 And I asked, how was that?

1127
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,820
 He said, it was fine.

1128
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,980
 I don't normally talk like this to middle school kids,

1129
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,020
 but I was like, hey man, like,

1130
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,580
 I know you're gonna be fine, but it sucks.

1131
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,340
 It's okay to say it sucks.

1132
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,220
 And he just started crying.

1133
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,460
 It fell into my chest and I was holding this kid.

1134
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,020
 And instantly when I was holding him,

1135
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,140
 I thought about all the time it costs me

1136
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,300
 to volunteer among these children.

1137
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:14,940
 But I just thought,

1138
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,260
 but there's nothing else I'd rather do with my life.

1139
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,660
 And I sat there and I was like,

1140
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:24,060
 I would have never at 23 knelt down in my bedroom

1141
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:24,900
 and thought, God,

1142
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,260
 will you just send me some middle school age boys

1143
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,100
 (congregation laughing)

1144
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,340
 to make me in your image?

1145
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,980
 I would have never asked for that.

1146
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,820
 Would have never crossed my mind.

1147
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:40,660
 But he wove us together for my good.

1148
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,500
 I had no idea.

1149
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,660
 I was a dwarf in prayer till I joined a church

1150
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,500
 where there were old ladies

1151
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,380
 that would just easily pray all night for somebody else.

1152
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,580
 Never experienced that.

1153
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,540
 I moved to a church in the inner city of Denver

1154
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,380
 and lived in it,

1155
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,300
 this wildly diverse church ethnically.

1156
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,380
 And so there's all these issues that come up

1157
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,100
 as cultures rub against each other.

1158
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,780
 But I watched a church not be scared of that,

1159
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,620
 but just like Paul,

1160
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,100
 be willing to bring it up and listen

1161
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,940
 and care for each other.

1162
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,100
 It was the most beautiful picture

1163
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,740
 of look what's possible in this place.

1164
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,060
 It was an open church.

1165
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,580
 In this place, it was an old grocery store

1166
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,540
 that closed down and left the neighborhood

1167
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,100
 because the store decided it's not worth being

1168
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:16,940
 in this neighborhood.

1169
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,780
 It got robbed too much.

1170
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,100
 And so the church moved in and they used to laugh about it.

1171
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,980
 Several of us that used to rob this church

1172
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,660
 are now ministering to the neighborhood

1173
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,420
 in Jesus' name in the same building.

1174
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,140
 (congregation laughing)

1175
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,740
 And I remember being in that church

1176
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,780
 and the front desk was manned by two people

1177
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,420
 who were the best of friends,

1178
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,740
 like little peas in a pod.

1179
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,420
 One was this little bitty old white lady

1180
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,740
 and one was a big, tall Hispanic man.

1181
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:46,020
 She was old, so she was frail,

1182
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,820
 but he was so gentle with her, helping her around.

1183
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,260
 And he had come out of a rough lifestyle

1184
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,900
 and had some illnesses of his own.

1185
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:58,300
 She would mother him and remind him to take his pills

1186
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,140
 and all this.

1187
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,300
 And you would just watch the way they would talk

1188
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,740
 to each other and you were like,

1189
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,540
 it's beautiful that God gave them to each other.

1190
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,460
 And I promise you,

1191
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,700
 she never knelt down in her old folks' home

1192
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,820
 or wherever she lived and just said,

1193
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:14,820
 "Lord, I just, I need a huge Hispanic former gang member

1194
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,380
 "in this last chapter of my life."

1195
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,340
 (congregation laughing)

1196
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:24,060
 I guarantee you, he was never in his room going like,

1197
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,980
 "Lord, I need a white grandma."

1198
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,820
 (congregation laughing)

1199
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,580
 He wasn't asking.

1200
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:33,700
 And let me warn you something.

1201
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,580
 If I was the enemy and wanted to destroy you,

1202
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:36,420
 what would I do?

1203
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,180
 I would make you not prioritize being among us.

1204
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,580
 That's a disinformation, distrust.

1205
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:46,300
 Take real problems, but exacerbate them.

1206
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,420
 Take those threads and pick at them

1207
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,740
 and pick at them and pick at them.

1208
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,740
 Keep you apart from each other

1209
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:50,740
 so you can't hear each other's hearts,

1210
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,340
 you only hear the language.

1211
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,020
 Throw volleys of hate on a phone.

1212
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,740
 Get this in between your relationships,

1213
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,540
 make it a dividing wall of hostility

1214
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,580
 and disintegrate the church

1215
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,660
 so that when the world is in the darkness,

1216
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,060
 we're already powerless before the fight starts.

1217
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,580
 And I wanna warn you,

1218
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,660
 Jesus Christ is reweaving a connection

1219
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,380
 between heaven and earth through his cross.

1220
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,740
 And he's reweaving a connection between us by his cross.

1221
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,140
 And I haven't given you much

1222
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,300
 by the way of application of how to do this,

1223
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,060
 but if we bear with one another

1224
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,500
 with gentleness and humility and patience,

1225
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,940
 we're not just built into individual Davids.

1226
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,660
 He said, "You're being built together

1227
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,940
 into a temple of the Holy Spirit."

1228
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,380
 The world will see something it desperately needs.

1229
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:38,100
 Robert Woodbury did a study

1230
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,900
 on the missionary roots of liberal democracy

1231
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,260
 published in a scientific journal.

1232
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,220
 He wanted to understand the impact of missionaries

1233
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,620
 on developing nations.

1234
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:49,100
 So he did a study over years and he said,

1235
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,860
 "What he found struck him like an atomic bomb."

1236
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:57,660
 He said that, "We found that missionaries,

1237
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,900
 when they entered economically developing nations,"

1238
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,980
 he said, "Wherever Protestant missionaries

1239
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,020
 had a significant presence,

1240
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,660
 those nations are more economically developed,

1241
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,340
 have comparatively better health,

1242
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:12,340
 have lower infant mortality, have lower corruption,

1243
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,260
 have greater literacy, have higher educational attainment,

1244
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,380
 especially for women,

1245
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,620
 and more robust membership and service."

1246
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,620
 And he said, "To be clear,

1247
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,060
 there were some racist missionaries

1248
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,940
 and self-centered missionaries,

1249
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,340
 but if that was the norm,

1250
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,300
 you would expect to see those negative effects

1251
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,140
 be the average, but the opposite was in place."

1252
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,540
 He said, "Wherever you saw missionaries come,

1253
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,700
 you saw a culture elevate."

1254
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,380
 But then he makes the important distinction.

1255
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,260
 When I say missionary,

1256
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,180
 I'm talking about conversionary Protestants,

1257
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,580
 which is a title he made up.

1258
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:46,180
 But he's trying to explain conversionary means

1259
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,720
 they're people who understand you need to be converted.

1260
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,820
 You were dead and need to be made alive.

1261
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,740
 And Protestant meaning they believe this book

1262
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,980
 is the word of God that tells you about a Jesus Christ

1263
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:58,100
 who came for you to reweave the fabric of a broken society

1264
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,980
 so that you would love God and love each other.

1265
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,620
 He said that message, when it lands in a culture,

1266
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,540
 doesn't just change individuals,

1267
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,460
 it actually changes cultures and changes nations.

1268
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,500
 And then this is what he wrote in his conclusion.

1269
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,620
 He said that these missionaries,

1270
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,780
 he said they imposed unjust and destructive practices

1271
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,860
 like opium addiction and slavery and land confiscation,

1272
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,620
 but they didn't set out to be political activists.

1273
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,780
 All this reform came through the back door.

1274
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:31,060
 All these positive outcomes were somewhat unintended,

1275
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:35,080
 which by saying he completely misreads the gospel.

1276
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:39,420
 Because Jesus says, when you make the tree good,

1277
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,140
 the fruit will be good.

1278
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,020
 He said, it's the weirdest thing.

1279
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,780
 People are coming to Christ and nations are rising,

1280
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,500
 but they didn't set out to change nations,

1281
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,460
 they set out to change people.

1282
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,280
 Isn't that weird?

1283
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,200
 And we say, no, not at all, Robert.

1284
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:55,580
 When we reweave the broken fabric between God and humanity,

1285
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:59,260
 he says, this isn't the only fabric of love I'm weaving.

1286
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,900
 I wanna weave it across every human boundary too,

1287
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:06,340
 so that when you love each other, cities change,

1288
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:10,700
 churches change, cultures change, society changes.

1289
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,140
 It's possible.

1290
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,900
 We're not too far gone.

1291
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,340
 I have great hope for America.

1292
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,660
 I have great hope for our nation.

1293
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,380
 I have great hope for your generation,

1294
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,340
 but not 'cause you're so great, but because he is.

1295
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,740
 So make that decision.

1296
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,460
 I'm gonna press into us,

1297
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,380
 not a hypothetical spirituality,

1298
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,700
 but a deep, robust community,

1299
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,700
 that as we rub up against each other, the world sees love.

1300
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,180
 They see you at churches.

1301
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,100
 They see you in places like this,

1302
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,180
 and they say, surely God is in their midst,

1303
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,300
 because nothing else makes sense.

1304
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,660
 And the light of the world will shine

1305
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,060
 in the darkness through us.

1306
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:43,960
 Lord, let it be.

1307
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,400
 So God, thank you,

1308
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:52,100
 that while we were a long way off, you came for us.

1309
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,060
 And God, I know there's some people in here

1310
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,700
 that have never put their faith in Jesus.

1311
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:01,660
 And I pray that first part of the sermon

1312
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,060
 would be for them, that they would say,

1313
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,180
 no, I know what I am.

1314
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:07,260
 I know I'm dead, and I keep trying to turn over a new leaf,

1315
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:11,220
 but I need to be resurrected.

1316
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,900
 And thank you, God, that you sent Christ,

1317
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,300
 that he can renovate hearts from the inside out.

1318
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:23,580
 And Lord, I pray there might be some men and women

1319
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,540
 here even tonight that say, I want you.

1320
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:28,800
 If you're rescuing, rescue me.

1321
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,600
 If you're reweaving the severed fabric

1322
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,300
 between heaven and earth, weave me in.

1323
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,460
 You tell him that tonight, friend,

1324
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,020
 and then please tell one of us.

1325
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:46,040
 And then God, for those of us who know you,

1326
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,620
 it's not shocking to watch a culture divide

1327
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:52,340
 of along very common lines, all throughout human stories,

1328
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,720
 we have divided across cultures.

1329
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,540
 Decided on socioeconomic boundaries,

1330
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,100
 political boundaries, ethnic boundaries, we divide.

1331
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:05,300
 But God, you have done something about that too.

1332
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,620
 The cross is so powerful.

1333
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,800
 It not only brings the dead to life,

1334
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,900
 it makes enemies into family.

1335
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,220
 So I pray, God, in the midst of a culture that's divided,

1336
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,380
 might they see us speak the truth to each other?

1337
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:22,200
 Not hide it, not bury it, but speak it in love,

1338
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,260
 with gentleness and humility, with patience,

1339
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:29,560
 bearing with one another, eager to maintain that unity.

1340
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,880
 And I pray, God, radiating out of our churches

1341
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,500
 and towns all across this country,

1342
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,340
 people would see, surely God is in their midst.

1343
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:40,180
 What could create a healing like that?

1344
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,740
 What kind of balm could heal the wounds

1345
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,840
 of a nation like that?

1346
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,340
 God, I pray the glory of all that you purchased

1347
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:50,260
 on the cross would be manifest through the unity

1348
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,320
 we persevere and maintain together.

1349
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,360
 Knit us together for your glory,

1350
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,700
 knit us together for our good,

1351
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:02,620
 and may our cities be different because we exist.

1352
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:09,640
 May this generation be different

1353
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,540
 because we dare to believe this truth.

1354
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,860
 I wanna invite you just to ask Him,

1355
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,660
 what would it look like for me, God,

1356
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:24,120
 to forgive someone who hurt me,

1357
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,440
 to reach out to someone I've avoided,

1358
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,460
 to pray for somebody that I secretly just wanna see fall.

1359
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,620
 What if I prayed and asked God to bless me?

1360
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:38,880
 To not give up when people are a hassle,

1361
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,180
 to press in with a question

1362
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,980
 rather than attack with a statement,

1363
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,000
 ask Him to give you a vision of what it might look like

1364
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,700
 to be the church to each other.

1365
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:57,720
 Let it be.

1366
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:07,720
