188
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Thank you for my friends who are walking faithfully just through all of the junk that's just in our life.

189
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 It's in our heart and we wait for the day where you totally remove it and you free us once and for all.

190
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 But until then, help us to walk honestly and authentically. May we struggle and be anything but liars.

191
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 I pray even now that we would expose in proper settings to brothers and sisters in our life anything that we need to

192
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 and that we would declare the greatness of our King despite the hypocrisy of our hearts.

193
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Thank you for Jesus, the only one who wasn't a hypocrite. In his name we pray. Amen.

194
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 I like never thought I would work for a church and still think it's like funny that I do at wake up days going,

195
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 "Am I still doing this?" And one of the reasons was I'd never seen authenticity the way that I've seen it here.

196
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 And I've never seen even, I have friends who work at other places and they go, "Yeah, you know, church politics."

197
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 And I always have to go, "I really don't." They say, "Yeah, once you get farther into the leadership of the church,

198
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 you'll just see kind of behind the curtain." And the more that I see, I'll tell you this, and I feel like,

199
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 I don't know how much credibility I have, but whatever that is, I can tell you the more and more that I see here,

200
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 and these guys are not perfect, but the farther in that I see, the more of Christ I see. I really do.

201
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 And I feel like I can say that about Todd in a way that he wouldn't be able to say about himself.

202
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 But if that gives you any confidence about a man who is, say, I'm not perfect or any of the elders,

203
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 but who long ago said, "Let's be a community of people who doesn't pretend to be perfect,

204
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 but proclaims that we have a perfect Savior. And let's be anything but liars along this journey.

205
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 Let's just be open about where we are. If there's times I don't feel like I need you, even though I know that I do."

206
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 And so tonight, if you're here for the first time, maybe in church in a long time,

207
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 and maybe you stepped out because you were hurt by someone who wore the name of Christ,

208
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 we'd love to talk to you, and we hate that for you. And we don't promise that it won't hurt here.

209
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 We do promise that we will be diligent to care, to ask for forgiveness if there's areas we need to,

210
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 and to seek to preserve the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace.

211
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 We make every effort to declare that when we are hypocritical, I'm a Christian hypocrite,

212
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 and I have a great Savior. If you don't know that Savior, we'd love to talk to you about Him.

213
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 [Silence]
