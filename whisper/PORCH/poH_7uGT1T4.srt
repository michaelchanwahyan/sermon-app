1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:23,600
 - What's up, Porch, how we doing tonight?

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,740
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,200
 Hey, it's good to see you, I hope that all is well.

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,400
 Happy Tuesday to you.

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,880
 My name is Timothy Atik, I'm one of the teaching pastors

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,920
 here at Watermark on Tuesday nights as well as on Sundays.

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,900
 If this is your first time ever with us on a Tuesday night,

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,480
 thank you for trusting us with your Tuesday night.

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,560
 I do wanna give a shout out to all the Porch Live

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,760
 locations watching, especially wanna say hello

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,760
 to Porch Live Midland, Porch Live Tulsa,

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,320
 Porch Live Boise, so glad that you're tuning in tonight,

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,720
 I hope all is well.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,320
 So here's the deal, I've got three boys

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,280
 and all three of my boys have birthdays at some point

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,280
 in the month that we are in, which is not great financially

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,640
 but it's just a reality for the Atik family,

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,160
 which means that we are thinking a lot about gifts

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,000
 that we are giving and the third kid's birthday

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,280
 is on October 12th and then right after that,

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,240
 like our kids are gonna be thinking about what they want

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,560
 for Christmas, so for the whole fall,

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,160
 we are really thinking about presents

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,240
 and something that I've learned over the years is this,

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,240
 when you give a gift to someone,

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,240
 you care about their response, the response matters.

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,920
 Like I remember when my oldest son Noah

29
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,800
 was three years old at Christmas,

30
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,080
 he got a lot of gifts 'cause he was the first grandkid

31
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,080
 and I remember him on Christmas, this was his rhythm,

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,000
 he would take a present, he would unwrap it,

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,360
 he would look at it, he would not say thank you

34
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,720
 and he would put it to the side,

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,360
 he would grab the next gift, he would unwrap it,

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,600
 he would look at it, he would not say thank you

37
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,200
 and he would put it to the side.

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,200
 After he unwrapped all of his gifts,

39
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,320
 he looked at my wife and me and said,

40
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,800
 what else you got for me?

41
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,000
 I was like, we're gonna need to work on that,

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,880
 you're a pastor's kid, that's not gonna fly,

43
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,760
 Jesus is the reason for the season, anyway.

44
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,960
 It's not the response we were looking for.

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,920
 Your response matters when you're receiving a gift.

46
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,120
 I remember when my wife and I, in our first year

47
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,840
 of marriage, I remember the first time

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,400
 we were exchanging gifts as a married couple,

49
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,400
 this is a big moment and I did not win in this situation.

50
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,480
 She gave me for Christmas, she gave me three shirts

51
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,280
 that I would consider to be super basic.

52
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,400
 Now, here's what you need to know about me, guys,

53
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,280
 I'm an Enneagram four, which means that

54
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,760
 I think I'm really special and I need to be special

55
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,800
 and I need everything to be unique,

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,700
 so I need the clothes that I wear to be unique

57
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,800
 and I know what you're thinking,

58
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
 you're wearing a polo in jeans,

59
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,200
 I don't wanna talk about it.

60
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,600
 But on this particular Christmas,

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,840
 I opened these three shirts and I just,

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,280
 it's not that I responded poorly, I just didn't respond,

63
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,280
 I was like, oh, okay, well, there's that.

64
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,200
 You know, like, I don't remember what I said,

65
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,000
 I don't remember if that was the moment

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,680
 that Cat threw a blanket at me

67
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,340
 or if that was another fight,

68
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,600
 I just remember it didn't go well.

69
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,200
 But then I think about a time when I was in sixth grade

70
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,600
 and I received a gift and we still have the video of it

71
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,600
 to this day, when I opened that gift, this was my response.

72
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,960
 I kid you not, this is what I did, I go.

73
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:10,940
 Because at that time in my life,

74
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,240
 there was a band out called New Kids on the Block

75
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,920
 and I was kind of into it

76
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,440
 and so they kind of fueled my response.

77
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,720
 That was the right response to the gift that I had received.

78
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,800
 Your response when you're receiving a gift,

79
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,280
 it really matters.

80
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,300
 And the reason I tell you that is because tonight,

81
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,000
 we are starting a new series

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,180
 that we're gonna be in for a lot of this fall

83
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,820
 where we are journeying through the gospel of John.

84
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,980
 And the gospel of John was written to help you and me

85
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,980
 have the right response to God's gift of Jesus Christ.

86
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,820
 The gospel of John has the most famous verse

87
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,900
 in the entire Bible.

88
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,420
 Even if you're not familiar with the Bible,

89
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,700
 you're most likely familiar with this verse.

90
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,020
 John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that he," what?

91
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,460
 "That he gave his only son,

92
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,400
 "that whoever believes in him should not perish,

93
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,900
 "but have eternal life."

94
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,460
 Jesus was a gift from God to you and to me.

95
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,180
 How you respond to the gift that God has given you matters.

96
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,060
 John, in his gospel, he uses the word believe

97
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,140
 about 84 times.

98
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,620
 That's the whole goal of the book.

99
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,360
 The goal of the book is that you and I would believe.

100
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,900
 Now, if you're sitting there saying,

101
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,360
 "I've believed in Jesus for a long time, so next,"

102
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,100
 like, I get it.

103
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,940
 Well, what you need to know is if you aren't a Christian,

104
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,940
 the goal is that you would move towards basic belief.

105
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,300
 And if you've been a Christian for a long time,

106
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,280
 my hope is that this book is gonna move you

107
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,820
 toward bold belief in Jesus Christ.

108
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,420
 This book is my favorite gospel out of the four

109
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,500
 that are in our Bible.

110
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,140
 I love this book.

111
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,220
 It's a powerful book that is going to drive us

112
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,220
 towards the right response to the gift of Jesus Christ.

113
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,940
 Just so you know what we're calling the series,

114
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,840
 we are calling it Glory.

115
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,660
 And that is very clear behind me.

116
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,140
 So it's called Glory, and you're gonna find out

117
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,840
 in a little bit what we mean when we say Glory.

118
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,240
 But the goal of this series is that you would behold

119
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,900
 Jesus Christ in this book,

120
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,620
 and it would lead to the right response.

121
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,340
 Just so you know how important this book,

122
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,260
 the Gospel of John is,

123
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,900
 one commentator referred to it

124
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,420
 as God's love letter to the world.

125
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,340
 Martin Luther, the German monk

126
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,980
 who sparked the Protestant Reformation said this.

127
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,220
 He said, "Should a tyrant succeed

128
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,400
 "in destroying the Holy Scriptures

129
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,680
 "in only a single copy of the Epistle to the Romans

130
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,360
 "and the Gospel according to John escape him,

131
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,220
 "Christianity would be saved."

132
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,940
 Why does he say that?

133
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,940
 He says that because this book is so instrumental.

134
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,020
 It is so essential to us understanding the beauty

135
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,140
 in the person of Jesus Christ,

136
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,100
 and it drives us toward the right response to him.

137
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,900
 We are learning from John.

138
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,380
 If you're new to the Bible,

139
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,220
 and John really isn't on your radar,

140
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,440
 John was a fisherman before he laid down his life

141
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,500
 as a fisherman to follow Jesus Christ full-time.

142
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,380
 Jesus had three guys that were kind of in his inner circle.

143
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:52,200
 It was Peter, and then John and his brother James.

144
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,300
 John was so tight with Jesus

145
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,380
 that Jesus gave him and his brother a nickname.

146
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,160
 He referred to James and John as the Sons of Thunder,

147
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,880
 which is a pretty baller nickname.

148
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,200
 Like, no one has ever referred to me as a Son of Thunder.

149
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,720
 Like, I just don't put off that type of vibe,

150
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,400
 but like, that was a killer nickname for James and John.

151
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,440
 John is the guy on the night that Jesus has his last supper.

152
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,600
 Do you know what John's doing?

153
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,400
 He's reclining on Jesus's chest

154
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,380
 because they're that tight.

155
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:31,440
 John refers to himself as the one that Jesus loved.

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,840
 John was the guy that when Jesus

157
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,440
 was being led to his crucifixion,

158
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,840
 he entrusted his mother to John.

159
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,120
 John was the first disciple to reach the empty tomb.

160
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,400
 He was the first disciple to believe

161
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,640
 in the resurrection of Jesus.

162
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,840
 John went on to write five books in the New Testament,

163
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,640
 and John played a key role

164
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,080
 in the establishment of the church.

165
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,680
 That's who we're learning from.

166
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,960
 This is a guy who had a very,

167
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,400
 very tight relationship with Jesus.

168
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,480
 He's a guy who had the right response to Jesus,

169
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,720
 and he writes 21 chapters in this book

170
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,440
 so that you and I would have the right response to Jesus.

171
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,400
 So tonight, here's what I wanna do.

172
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,640
 I wanna speak to three different groups

173
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,080
 of people in this room.

174
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,000
 I first am going to speak to those in the room

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,920
 who aren't Christians.

176
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,000
 You don't have a relationship with Jesus.

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,800
 The only reason you're here tonight

178
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,480
 is because a friend invited you,

179
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,440
 and you've told them no so many times,

180
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,640
 you finally felt like they needed a win.

181
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,880
 And so for you, the response that I wanna encourage

182
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,680
 in you tonight is to investigate Jesus.

183
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,840
 I also wanna speak to a group of people in this room

184
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,080
 who are not Christians yet,

185
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,320
 but you're gonna become a Christian tonight

186
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,400
 because God is doing something miraculous in your life

187
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,200
 and something deeply important in your life.

188
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,480
 And something deep inside of you is like,

189
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,360
 I need to be here tonight.

190
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,680
 And the response that I wanna encourage you toward tonight

191
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,000
 is to receive Jesus.

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,720
 And then I wanna speak to a group of people

193
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,520
 who've been following Jesus for a long time.

194
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,160
 Jesus is your savior.

195
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,800
 Jesus is your king.

196
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,840
 And the response that I wanna encourage in you

197
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,440
 is that you would behold Jesus tonight.

198
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,640
 Three responses.

199
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,800
 Those are the right responses to the gift of Jesus Christ.

200
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,160
 First, I wanna speak to the group of people in this room

201
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,600
 who would say, I am not a Christian.

202
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,840
 Maybe you're an atheist.

203
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,080
 Maybe you're an agnostic.

204
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,440
 I'm so glad you're here.

205
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,080
 This is a place where you can come

206
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,480
 and evaluate what we believe is the word of God.

207
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,760
 Please come back.

208
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,000
 But if that's you,

209
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,960
 I wanna invite you to investigate Jesus.

210
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,600
 There's a famous pastor named A.W. Tozer,

211
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,920
 and he said, what comes into our minds

212
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,120
 when we think about God

213
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,400
 is the most important thing about us.

214
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,800
 And I would just encourage you to evaluate that.

215
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,120
 What comes to mind when you think about Jesus Christ,

216
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,520
 that is potentially the most important thing about you.

217
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,520
 Yesterday on Instagram, we asked what you thought of Jesus.

218
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,000
 And some of you said, he's my best friend.

219
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,800
 Someone said, he's like an older sibling to me.

220
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,720
 One of you was super honest and just said, I love him,

221
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,040
 but I get frustrated with him

222
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,480
 and don't understand his plans most of the time.

223
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,400
 That's real.

224
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,000
 So I don't know what you think of Jesus

225
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,640
 when you think about him.

226
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,840
 But I would imagine that many of you here

227
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,000
 who are not Christians, if I were to ask you,

228
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,560
 what comes to mind when I mentioned the name Jesus,

229
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,120
 you might say, not much.

230
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,120
 Or when you think about Jesus,

231
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,080
 you think about the people that you know

232
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,000
 that claim to be following him.

233
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,320
 And the people you struggle with most in this world

234
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,840
 are the people who seem hypocritical,

235
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,640
 but they claim to know Jesus.

236
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,160
 Or maybe when you think of Jesus,

237
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,740
 you think about the miracles you've heard

238
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,000
 that the Bible claims that he did.

239
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,760
 Or you know about the fact that Jesus is said

240
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,560
 to have been crucified on a cross.

241
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,860
 And there are billions of people around the world

242
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,880
 that would subscribe to his religion.

243
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,020
 The chances are, when you think about Jesus,

244
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,860
 what comes to mind, it's the 33 years

245
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,300
 that he lived on earth.

246
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,820
 But if that's all that comes to your mind,

247
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,380
 what you need to know is that you are cropping out

248
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:42,380
 eternity from Jesus's identity and his activity.

249
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,940
 So I want to invite you to investigate Jesus.

250
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,740
 Like, let me ask you, have you ever thought of Jesus as God?

251
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,100
 Have you ever thought of Jesus as God?

252
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,540
 Look with me at the Gospel of John chapter one.

253
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,100
 The Gospel of John chapter one.

254
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,700
 Here's how it starts in verse one.

255
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,620
 It says, "In the beginning was the word,

256
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,620
 "and the word was with God, and the word was God."

257
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,700
 John here is referring to Jesus as the word.

258
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,780
 Why would John refer to Jesus as the word?

259
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,820
 Well, think about what a word is.

260
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,380
 A word is a thought expressed.

261
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,520
 A word makes known something hidden.

262
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,860
 It makes something unheard heard.

263
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,780
 It makes something invisible visible.

264
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,080
 Here's what that means.

265
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,380
 Why is John referring to Jesus as the word?

266
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,520
 Because what he's trying to communicate

267
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,540
 is that Jesus is God's greatest communication

268
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,780
 to humanity about himself.

269
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,420
 So if you want to know God,

270
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,340
 then the best thing you can do is know Jesus Christ.

271
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,940
 If you want to know more of God, then investigate Jesus.

272
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,360
 If you have some working knowledge of the Bible,

273
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,280
 if you've even just read the first verse

274
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,220
 of the entire thing, it's Genesis 1.1,

275
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,320
 think about how it starts.

276
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,100
 It says, "In the beginning,

277
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,820
 "God created the heavens and the earth."

278
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,220
 Did you hear how John chapter one, verse one started?

279
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,580
 "In the beginning was the word,

280
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:31,220
 "and the word was with God, and the word was God."

281
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,780
 According to John, Jesus's story doesn't start

282
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,980
 in a manger in Bethlehem.

283
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,220
 John is placing the eternal word,

284
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,480
 the eternal son of God, who would take on flesh

285
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,340
 in the person of Jesus Christ,

286
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,340
 he is placing him before the creation of the world.

287
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:56,540
 The eternal word that we now know as Jesus

288
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,060
 is in fact God.

289
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,380
 He's not just a wise teacher.

290
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,360
 He's not just a prophet.

291
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,260
 He's not just a significant religious figure.

292
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,180
 He is God.

293
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,940
 And to believe that he's just a good man

294
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,940
 or a wise teacher is crazy because Jesus claimed to be God

295
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,860
 and all of his followers claimed that he was God.

296
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,620
 So if someone is claiming to be God,

297
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,620
 but he's just a man and not God,

298
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,620
 that either makes him a liar or a crazy person.

299
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,000
 And so the reality is Jesus is God.

300
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,520
 The God of Christianity is the God where Jesus is God.

301
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,620
 If Jesus isn't God, then it isn't Christianity.

302
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,240
 Have you ever thought of Jesus being God?

303
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,080
 What about this?

304
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,600
 Have you ever thought of Jesus as the creator of all things?

305
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,440
 Look at what John says in verses two and three.

306
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,000
 He says, "He," referring to the word,

307
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,960
 who we now know as Jesus,

308
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,640
 "He was in the beginning with God.

309
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,980
 "All things," watch that,

310
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,700
 "All things were made through him.

311
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,840
 "And without him was not anything made that was made."

312
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,520
 So according to John, the word Jesus

313
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,000
 that we now know as Jesus,

314
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,480
 he was the agent of all creation.

315
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,840
 So when you think about Jesus,

316
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,500
 do you think to give him credit for his work

317
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,120
 in everything that has been made, including you?

318
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
 Or what about this?

319
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,280
 Have you ever thought of Jesus

320
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,520
 as the one sustaining your life?

321
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,960
 Listen to what verse four says.

322
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,320
 John says, "In him was life.

323
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,320
 "In the life was the light of men."

324
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,520
 So I want you to think about this.

325
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,280
 John refers to Jesus as the light of men.

326
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,280
 I think we can all agree that life on the earth

327
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,160
 is impossible without the sun, which provides us light.

328
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,760
 Physical life needs the light that the sun gives

329
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,960
 in order for us to live.

330
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,600
 And yet what John is proposing is that even more important

331
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,600
 than the physical sun is the eternal son of God, Jesus Christ.

332
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,560
 In him is life, meaning that apart from Jesus,

333
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,020
 it's actually impossible for you to live physically,

334
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:34,020
 but it's also impossible for you to live spiritually.

335
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,420
 Some of you might be sitting there wondering,

336
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,740
 what has God ever done for me?

337
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,740
 I just want to invite every person in here

338
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,460
 to just take a breath, just breathe in, breathe out.

339
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,480
 There's your answer.

340
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,700
 Like that breath you just took is the best rebuttal

341
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,060
 to the belief that Jesus is irrelevant to your life.

342
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,660
 Because according to John,

343
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,700
 Jesus is not only the creator of life,

344
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,660
 he's the sustainer of life.

345
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,700
 You have oxygen in your lungs today

346
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,580
 because the eternal son of God is the agent

347
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,220
 through which that breath has come.

348
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,940
 And then verse five, what does John say?

349
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,100
 He says, "The light shines in the darkness

350
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,020
 "and the darkness has not overcome it."

351
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,580
 There's this shift in this passage

352
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,900
 in the first five verses.

353
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,780
 Verse five marks a shift, and it's subtle,

354
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,720
 but John is shifting from talking about the physical

355
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,580
 to now talking about the spiritual.

356
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,180
 See, darkness wasn't just a reference

357
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,460
 to the absence of light in life

358
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,260
 at the beginning of creation.

359
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,860
 It was actually to symbolize evil within humanity

360
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,980
 in the absence of spiritual life.

361
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,020
 So what John is saying when he says,

362
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,700
 "The light shines in the darkness

363
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,620
 "and the darkness has not overcome it,"

364
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,460
 is he is saying that not only is Jesus

365
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,560
 the sustainer of physical life,

366
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,560
 but he is our only hope for spiritual life,

367
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,060
 life with God.

368
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,620
 So the reason that I tell you this,

369
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,420
 if you are not a Christian in the room,

370
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,940
 and when you think about Jesus,

371
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,740
 all you think about is either the people

372
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,020
 who claim to follow him or the few details

373
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,600
 that you know about his life on the earth,

374
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,940
 what you need to understand

375
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,300
 is that you are cropping out eternity

376
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,920
 from Jesus's identity and his activity.

377
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,300
 Why do we use the crop feature on our photos?

378
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,540
 It is to remove things that are either unattractive

379
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,160
 or unimportant.

380
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,800
 Here's what you need to understand.

381
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,800
 If Jesus feels unimpressive or irrelevant to you,

382
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,920
 do you know what's happened?

383
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,800
 You've cropped out what you think is unimportant.

384
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,880
 And what you've done is you've cropped out

385
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,220
 so much of Jesus's identity and activity

386
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:12,220
 that you are no longer actually dealing with the real Jesus.

387
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,720
 You're actually just dealing with a Jesus

388
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,400
 that you have fabricated in your mind.

389
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,820
 Our world says that you get to decide who God is,

390
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,940
 but we don't get to decide who God is.

391
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,940
 We only get to decide what we do with who God is.

392
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,680
 And so if you're here tonight and you're not a Christian,

393
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,440
 my invitation to you,

394
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,040
 the right way to respond to the gift of Jesus

395
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,720
 is to investigate Jesus.

396
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,180
 Let me explain it this way.

397
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:51,400
 My wife and my three boys and I,

398
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,400
 we have a standing tradition that Friday night each week

399
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
 is pizza and a movie night.

400
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,760
 So we get a cheap pizza from Costco,

401
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,840
 which is surprisingly good for the price.

402
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,520
 You young adults should know about Costco pizza.

403
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,720
 If you don't, go get a membership.

404
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,660
 It's worth it.

405
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,420
 [audience applauding]

406
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,420
 But we get a cheap pizza from Costco

407
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,420
 and every Friday night we watch a movie.

408
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,460
 Well, we have done that so many Friday nights

409
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,220
 that it's getting harder and harder

410
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,000
 to decide what movie to watch,

411
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,460
 because it feels like we've gone through

412
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,420
 so many of the good ones.

413
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,420
 But there's this weird thing happening with my boys,

414
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,020
 and I don't know if it's just that they're getting older

415
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,500
 and they're beginning to reach that point

416
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,780
 where nothing that their dad says is cool,

417
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,060
 and if dad suggests it, we should definitely not do it.

418
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,340
 I don't know if that's what's happening.

419
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,340
 But there's this weird phenomenon happening

420
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,580
 where I can name a movie.

421
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,180
 I can say, "Hey, we should watch this movie."

422
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,200
 And it can be one of the classics,

423
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,420
 one of the greats from the '80s or the '90s

424
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:03,020
 that is on like lists of top movies for families.

425
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,060
 And my boys could have never heard of it,

426
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,860
 never seen a trailer for it, and be like, "Nope."

427
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,060
 So just think about it.

428
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,900
 Here's what they have said, "Nope," to "Princess Bride."

429
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,420
 Remember the Titans.

430
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,260
 Hook.

431
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,820
 Angels in the Outfield, y'all know that?

432
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,800
 Maybe not really.

433
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,320
 Stuff like that.

434
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,460
 I'm sure that there's more.

435
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,700
 There's one of my favorites, it was called "Short Circuit,"

436
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,900
 which was about a robot,

437
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,760
 and they're probably justified in saying no to it.

438
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,220
 But it's this weird thing

439
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,180
 where it's easy for them to reject something

440
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:47,060
 that they have no knowledge or any familiarity with.

441
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,380
 And I tell you that just to say,

442
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,820
 "Don't be like my kids when it comes to Jesus."

443
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,140
 It's often easy to reject something

444
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,820
 that you have no familiarity with.

445
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:03,280
 My encouragement to you is if Jesus is

446
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,420
 who this book says He is,

447
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,780
 now you might internally be like,

448
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,260
 "No, I don't believe that book."

449
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,340
 Well, but just because you don't believe it

450
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,640
 doesn't mean that it's not true.

451
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,580
 Your opinions have no bearing on truth,

452
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,420
 but truth should have a lot of bearing on your opinions.

453
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,540
 And so my encouragement is to at least investigate

454
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:30,140
 so that you can come to a place where you can say,

455
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,120
 with full confidence and full integrity,

456
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,280
 "I have investigated the person of Jesus Christ,

457
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,680
 the one that people claimed was God,

458
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,640
 the one that people claimed was the creator

459
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,160
 and sustainer of all things,

460
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,760
 the one that people claimed was the only way

461
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,200
 to have a true life with God, and I reject it."

462
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,480
 You wanna be able to say that with full integrity,

463
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,560
 that you've done the hard work to investigate,

464
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,180
 but don't reject a person

465
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,680
 that you have zero familiarity with.

466
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,300
 Investigate 'em.

467
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,380
 And we would love to help you do that.

468
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,940
 The second group of people that I wanna talk to

469
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,140
 is I wanna talk to a group of people in the room

470
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,100
 that a miracle is happening in your life.

471
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,460
 There's no other way to say it

472
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,180
 besides there's a miracle happening in your life.

473
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,660
 Like you're here tonight

474
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,940
 because something deep inside of you was like,

475
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,980
 "I need to be there."

476
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,200
 Like something's going on with you

477
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,700
 where you've been contemplating your life more and more,

478
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,180
 thoughts of God are popping into your head more and more,

479
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,420
 you've been thinking about eternity more,

480
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,600
 you've wondered more and more

481
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,440
 what the purpose is in your life.

482
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,100
 The things that you've been looking to

483
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,860
 in this world to satisfy you

484
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,100
 just don't seem to be doing what you hoped they would do.

485
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,100
 And so in your quest to feel satisfied,

486
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,580
 you feel lacking and empty.

487
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,340
 And what has happened is God is drawing you to himself

488
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,240
 and tonight he is introducing himself to you.

489
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,580
 And he's inviting you into a relationship with him.

490
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,720
 If that's you, a miracle is happening in your life.

491
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,180
 And the right response to the gift of Jesus

492
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,340
 is to receive Jesus.

493
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,500
 Look at what John says in verses nine through 13.

494
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,220
 He says, "The true light, Jesus,

495
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,500
 "which gives light to everyone,

496
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,000
 "was coming into the world.

497
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,200
 "He was in the world and the world was made through him,

498
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,940
 "yet the world didn't know him.

499
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,640
 "He came to his own and his own people did not receive him.

500
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,460
 "But to all who did receive him,

501
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,700
 "who believed in his name,

502
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,300
 "he gave the right to become children of God,

503
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,700
 "who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh

504
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,460
 "nor of the will of man, but of God."

505
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,860
 What I want you to see is the terminology in these verses.

506
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,820
 It turns relational.

507
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,820
 Do you see what it says?

508
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:03,700
 It says that Jesus came into the world,

509
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,180
 he made the world, and yet the world didn't know him,

510
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,540
 which means he moved in.

511
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:14,300
 God in the person of Jesus moved in close enough

512
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,780
 for people to be able to know him.

513
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,140
 Watch what verse 11 says.

514
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,660
 It says he came to his own.

515
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,260
 There's relationship.

516
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,620
 He came to his own people

517
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,380
 and his own people didn't receive him.

518
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,700
 Like he moved in close enough

519
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,780
 that people had to make a decision

520
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:37,240
 either to receive him or reject him.

521
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,020
 And here's the crazy thing.

522
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:45,020
 Jesus, the world was made through the eternal son of God,

523
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,660
 who we know to be Jesus.

524
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,100
 And yet what do we do?

525
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,700
 We give credit to other gods

526
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,620
 because we subscribe to other religions

527
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,580
 or we give credit to random natural forces.

528
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,020
 That would drive you crazy.

529
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,300
 Like have you ever been at work

530
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,860
 and you work really hard on a project at work

531
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:12,420
 and yet your boss gives credit to a group of people

532
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,700
 when you're the one who's done all the work

533
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,620
 and something in you is like,

534
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,180
 "No, no, no, I'm the one who did it."

535
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,900
 Like flashback to high school

536
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,180
 when you were in group projects.

537
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,860
 Some of y'all loved group projects

538
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,900
 because you let other people do all the work.

539
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,780
 And then there were those of you who hated group projects

540
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,640
 because you did all the work.

541
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,300
 How maddening is it and frustrating

542
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:42,580
 when other people are given credit for something you did?

543
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,060
 Jesus came into the world,

544
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,780
 the world which he had made

545
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,300
 and yet people didn't know him or receive him.

546
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,460
 What grace and love.

547
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:00,460
 This is how good God is that you can live your entire life

548
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,900
 on the earth that he made and not receive him.

549
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,540
 That is grace.

550
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,380
 That's grace.

551
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,140
 And if you do receive him,

552
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,500
 do you know what the result is?

553
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,980
 If you do receive him,

554
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,980
 the result is that you have a place

555
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,960
 in the family of God for all of eternity.

556
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,580
 That's why Jesus says,

557
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,060
 "But to all who did receive him,

558
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:33,220
 "he gave the right to become children of God."

559
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,860
 Which is amazing to think about this.

560
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,060
 There's 8 billion people on the planet

561
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:41,060
 and the God of the universe doesn't just know your name.

562
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:45,140
 He actually calls you his son or his daughter.

563
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:51,540
 And so what is the right response to the gift of Jesus?

564
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:56,420
 According to John 1, verse 12, it's to receive him.

565
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,560
 That word in the Greek,

566
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,540
 the original language of the New Testament,

567
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:04,540
 it carries the idea of welcoming intimate connection.

568
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:09,180
 It's like when a man or woman receives someone in marriage

569
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,700
 or when a host receives a house guest.

570
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,140
 On October, or I'm sorry, on June 2nd, 2006,

571
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,980
 I proposed to Kat.

572
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,060
 And I'll save you the story,

573
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:26,060
 but it culminated in me getting down on a knee in a rowboat

574
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,220
 and asking Kat to marry me.

575
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:33,220
 And she said yes, which I praise God for to this day.

576
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,600
 But here's the reality.

577
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,480
 When Kat said yes, she wasn't just saying yes

578
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,100
 to me putting a ring on her finger.

579
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,960
 She wasn't just saying yes to the most expensive party

580
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,140
 that we would ever throw in our lives.

581
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,860
 What she was saying yes to was life with this guy.

582
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:53,560
 She was saying yes to living together

583
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,920
 for the rest of her days on earth.

584
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,980
 She was saying yes to eating the majority

585
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,460
 of her meals with me.

586
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,460
 She was saying yes to raising three crazy boys with me.

587
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,500
 She was saying yes to the good times in life

588
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,900
 and the low times in life with me.

589
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,860
 She was saying yes to a lifetime of connection.

590
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:21,100
 To receive Jesus is to welcome

591
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,060
 intimate connection with him.

592
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,840
 So we need to be careful that we don't overcomplicate

593
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,680
 receiving Jesus.

594
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,400
 And at the same time, we have to be careful

595
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,660
 not to water it down.

596
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,360
 When we talk about receiving Jesus

597
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,240
 or welcoming intimate connection,

598
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,520
 I'm not talking about you signing up

599
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,520
 for a lifetime supply of requirements

600
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,080
 that you have to check off every day of your life.

601
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,920
 But it's also not just receiving information or ideas.

602
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,380
 It's receiving Jesus.

603
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,040
 It's welcoming intimate connection with him.

604
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,480
 Remember, your response matters.

605
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,680
 And the nature of the gift should drive

606
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,840
 the nature of your response.

607
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,760
 What do I mean by that?

608
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,240
 Here's what I mean.

609
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,940
 Often people treat Jesus like a ticket.

610
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,760
 That the reason to believe in Jesus

611
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,680
 is so that you get entrance into heaven.

612
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,400
 But think about a ticket.

613
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,600
 A ticket is only useful for one second

614
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,000
 when it's being scanned for entrance.

615
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,860
 It's useless before and it's useless after.

616
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,040
 Jesus is not a ticket.

617
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,840
 He's not only useful for just entrance into heaven.

618
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,800
 Jesus isn't a ticket.

619
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,840
 He's God, he's savior, he's rescuer, he's king, he's friend.

620
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,540
 To receive Jesus is to welcome a lifetime

621
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,040
 of intimate connection with him.

622
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,800
 And it begins with a prayer to God

623
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,200
 in which you acknowledge your sin

624
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,560
 and your need and desire for a savior and king.

625
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,800
 So if you're here tonight and you're like,

626
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,580
 I think he's talking about me.

627
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,800
 I think that a miracle is happening in my life.

628
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,840
 And I think Jesus is calling me to himself.

629
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,980
 Then say yes.

630
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:18,980
 Like what is keeping you from receiving Jesus tonight?

631
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,880
 Receive him.

632
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,120
 And then the third group of people I wanna speak to

633
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,240
 is the people in the room who have considered themselves

634
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,520
 followers of Jesus Christ for a long time.

635
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,800
 The right response to the gift of Jesus is to behold Jesus.

636
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,520
 When I talk about beholding Jesus,

637
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,220
 I'm talking about seeing Jesus.

638
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,560
 I'm talking about the idea of spiritual sight

639
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,020
 that we find in the scriptures.

640
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,040
 Like the apostle Paul in Ephesians 1:18 says,

641
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,320
 "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened

642
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,040
 "in order that you may know the hope

643
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,440
 "to which he has called you."

644
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,040
 Jesus, after he feeds 5,000 people

645
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,800
 with a little kid's lunchbox,

646
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,360
 he then feeds 4,000 people.

647
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,700
 We don't think about the feeding of the 4,000

648
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,920
 like we think about the feeding of the 5,000.

649
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,520
 But after he feeds the 5,000 and then he feeds the 4,000,

650
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,320
 he gets on a boat with his closest friends, the disciples,

651
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,280
 who actually had helped distribute the miraculous food

652
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,560
 that Jesus had just made.

653
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,760
 And when they get into the boat,

654
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,560
 they start arguing with each other.

655
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,000
 Do you wanna know why they're arguing?

656
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,200
 Because they forgot to bring bread.

657
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,840
 And it's like, guys,

658
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,880
 like if there's one thing you don't need to be worried about

659
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,520
 when you're with Jesus,

660
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,000
 it's bread.

661
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,640
 Like he just fed 9,000 plus people bread.

662
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,760
 Some of y'all are gluten intolerant,

663
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,520
 you're like, I don't get this at all.

664
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,920
 I don't know what we're talking about right now.

665
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,320
 Listen to what Jesus says to them, Mark 8.

666
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,440
 Jesus, aware of this, said to them,

667
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,320
 why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread?

668
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,280
 I love this.

669
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,460
 He says, do you not yet perceive or understand?

670
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,340
 He's like, what are we doing here, people?

671
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:20,700
 You were there for the 5,000, you were there for the 4,000.

672
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,000
 Do you not get it?

673
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,120
 You don't perceive?

674
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,000
 Now watch what he says, this is so important.

675
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,680
 He says, are your hearts hardened?

676
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:33,340
 Having eyes, do you not see?

677
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,560
 When I talk about beholding Jesus,

678
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,660
 I'm talking about spiritual sight.

679
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:44,240
 It's the reality that it's possible to see Jesus

680
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,540
 without seeing Jesus.

681
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,760
 It's possible to come to the porch

682
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,760
 and to go to all the effort, to park in a parking garage

683
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,400
 and literally get all of your steps for the day.

684
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,840
 Like if you show up with zero steps,

685
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,560
 you're going to leave with your exercise ring closed,

686
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,280
 just coming to the porch.

687
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,320
 And you can go to all that effort

688
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,820
 and leave here without seeing Jesus.

689
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,200
 When the night is all about Jesus,

690
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,540
 why does the porch exist?

691
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:22,200
 The porch exists to call any and every young adult to what?

692
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,320
 See Jesus and surrender fully to life with him.

693
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,120
 You know what spiritual blindness is?

694
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,700
 Spiritual blindness is simply seeing Jesus

695
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,520
 without being captivated by his goodness

696
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,400
 or being compelled to worship him.

697
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,240
 It's going to all the effort to be here tonight

698
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,540
 and leaving here unmoved.

699
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,400
 So what I want to do is I want to show you

700
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,360
 where I'm getting this from John chapter one.

701
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,560
 I'm going to read you right now the most important verse

702
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,280
 in the entire book of John.

703
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,680
 There's 21 chapters.

704
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,940
 This is the most important verse.

705
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,440
 Actually, the next 20 chapters of the book

706
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,020
 seek to unpack this one verse.

707
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,180
 Here's what it says.

708
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,120
 It says in verse 14, it says,

709
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,960
 "The word became flesh and dwelt among us

710
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,200
 and we have," say it, what's that word?

711
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,160
 We have seen or beheld his glory.

712
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,280
 Glory is of the only son from the father,

713
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,400
 full of grace and truth.

714
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,960
 I just want to break this verse down

715
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,840
 because I want you to see Jesus.

716
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,640
 And remember, I'm talking to the Christians.

717
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,660
 And what I'm doing is I am inviting those of you

718
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,600
 who have known Jesus for a long time.

719
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,480
 I want you to hear what I'm saying

720
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,240
 like you have never heard it before in your life.

721
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,200
 Listen to what it says.

722
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,640
 The word became flesh.

723
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,480
 Do you know what that's saying?

724
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,640
 It's saying God became man.

725
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,640
 Rip off the calluses of your heart

726
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,880
 to the reality of the incarnation

727
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,720
 that God stepped out of heaven and put on skin.

728
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,240
 Blood flowed through his veins.

729
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,940
 God became a man.

730
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,320
 That is crazy.

731
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,920
 It's crazy.

732
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,760
 Why?

733
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,680
 Because man spends his life

734
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,800
 trying to ascend to the place of God.

735
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,160
 That's why Jay-Z nicknamed himself Hova,

736
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,880
 which is short for Jehovah, name for God.

737
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,920
 That's why Kanye West has a song called "I Am a God."

738
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,800
 Why?

739
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,720
 Because man wants to ascend to the place of God.

740
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,840
 What we're talking about is God

741
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,800
 descending to the place of man.

742
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,320
 Now watch John's wording.

743
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,640
 He says, "And the word became flesh and dwelt among us,

744
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,000
 "and we have seen his glory."

745
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,800
 We have seen, we have beheld his glory.

746
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,200
 What does John mean when he says we've seen his glory?

747
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,960
 What does glory mean?

748
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,240
 Well, commentators believe that when John

749
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,160
 is writing these words, most likely,

750
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,640
 he has Exodus chapter 33 in his mind.

751
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,520
 And what's great is Exodus 33

752
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,140
 helps us understand what glory means.

753
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,120
 Moses says this in Exodus 33.

754
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,520
 Moses says to God, "Please show me your glory."

755
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,720
 It's a great prayer to pray.

756
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,280
 Please show me your glory.

757
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,200
 And what does God say?

758
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,200
 He says, "I will make all my goodness pass before you,

759
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,840
 "and will proclaim before you my name, the Lord."

760
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,640
 Do you know what the glory of God is?

761
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:36,160
 The glory of God is the supreme goodness of God.

762
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,020
 It is everything praiseworthy of God

763
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,760
 wrapped up and bundled and manifested to humanity

764
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,480
 so that humanity can taste and see that the Lord is good.

765
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,600
 Let me ask you, if you're a follower of Jesus Christ,

766
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,280
 when's the last time you were captivated

767
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,960
 by the beauty and the goodness of God?

768
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,960
 When's the last time you tasted and saw that God is good?

769
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:09,600
 What does it mean when John says we have beheld his glory?

770
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,440
 Well, what you need to understand is God's supreme goodness

771
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,200
 has been revealed to us in the person of Jesus Christ,

772
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,440
 specifically through the grace and the truth

773
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,840
 that Christ brought into the world.

774
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,660
 That's why John says, "We have seen his glory,

775
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,400
 "glory of the only Son from the Father,

776
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,240
 "full of grace and truth."

777
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,200
 I'm inviting you to behold, once again,

778
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
 the grace of Jesus Christ.

779
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,400
 Behold his grace because through receiving Jesus,

780
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,400
 we have complete forgiveness from our worst moments.

781
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,000
 We have healing and relief from our greatest shame.

782
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,840
 We're loved despite our most unlovable flaws.

783
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,360
 We are pursued with a perfect love,

784
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,800
 even when we wander in our imperfection.

785
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,900
 We can live near to God now and for all of eternity

786
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,360
 as loved, accepted, delighted and children of God.

787
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,940
 We did nothing, he did everything.

788
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,800
 We deserve nothing, and yet we get everything

789
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,440
 because of him.

790
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,440
 He's full of grace, but he's also full of truth.

791
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,280
 What does it mean that Jesus is full of truth?

792
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,200
 It means that Jesus has come and he has shown us

793
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,320
 the one and only way to have a real relationship

794
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,640
 with the God of the universe.

795
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,040
 Jesus says in John 14, six, "I am the way, the truth,

796
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,880
 "and the life.

797
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,880
 "No one comes to the Father except through me."

798
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,080
 You don't find your own way to God.

799
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,800
 Jesus says, "I'm the true way, I'm the truth."

800
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:39,000
 And all of this grace and truth has manifested itself

801
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,040
 in Jesus, who went to the cross, bore our shame,

802
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,400
 and rose from the dead.

803
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,060
 That's why Revelation 19, 13 says about Jesus,

804
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:51,040
 "He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood,

805
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,200
 "and the name by which he is called is," what?

806
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,480
 "The word of God."

807
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,940
 The word of God, God's greatest communication to us

808
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,520
 about himself was God who took on flesh,

809
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,840
 and the reason that his robe is dipped in blood

810
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,040
 at the end of the Bible is because Jesus went to the cross

811
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,320
 and endured the wrath that was for our sin.

812
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,480
 He was punished so that you and I wouldn't have to be.

813
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,600
 He was buried and he rose from the dead as a demonstration

814
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,320
 that the God of the universe, a holy and perfect God,

815
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,760
 had accepted his payment on behalf

816
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,040
 of very unholy, imperfect people.

817
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,120
 So I just wanna ask you, Christian,

818
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,160
 when was the last time that you beheld Jesus?

819
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,360
 When was the last time you were captivated by his goodness

820
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,380
 and compelled to worship him with your life?

821
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,280
 If you're here tonight as a Christian

822
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,920
 and your heart feels cold to Jesus right now,

823
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,000
 I wanna help you.

824
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,860
 If there's a lack of worship, it's due to a lack of sight.

825
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:59,580
 And so let me just ask you, is there sin?

826
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,840
 Is there sin in your life?

827
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,240
 Listen to what Matthew 5, 8 says.

828
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,880
 "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."

829
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,880
 Sin hinders sight.

830
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,120
 Do you understand that?

831
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,500
 Sin hinders sight.

832
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,780
 It's hard to be captivated by the goodness of God

833
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,760
 when you are captivated by the pleasure of sin.

834
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,000
 If you wanna see Jesus, I wanna say this with love,

835
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,720
 but repent of your sin.

836
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:31,680
 Don't walk out of here and live with one foot in

837
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,080
 and one foot out.

838
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,720
 Don't cling to sin thinking that it's not a big deal

839
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,760
 and it's really not hindering sight.

840
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,760
 When you release that sin, you're gonna see

841
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,840
 just how blurry your vision has become.

842
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,560
 And when you see Jesus clearly,

843
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,480
 you know what you're gonna see,

844
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,760
 you're gonna see something that is far more satisfying

845
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,360
 than your sin ever could have been.

846
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,260
 Repent.

847
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:57,800
 Another question to answer is, are you settling?

848
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,760
 Are you settling?

849
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,160
 What do I mean by that?

850
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,840
 Here's what I mean.

851
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,320
 Is it possible that you are living vicariously

852
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,080
 through someone else's sight?

853
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,360
 You know what drives me crazy about my kids' generation?

854
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,080
 Is that my boys, one of my boys will watch

855
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,140
 20 minute long YouTube videos

856
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,040
 of other people playing Minecraft.

857
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,440
 And I'm like, bro, you have Minecraft yourself.

858
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,960
 Why would you watch someone else play a game that you have?

859
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,800
 Makes no sense.

860
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,040
 Who has the greater enjoyment of playing Minecraft?

861
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,600
 It's the people playing Minecraft,

862
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,200
 not the people watching the people playing Minecraft.

863
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,880
 And so here's the reality.

864
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,440
 Some of you guys are just trying to live through,

865
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,820
 live vicariously through other people's sight.

866
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,480
 Like you just, you watch reels

867
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,240
 of your favorite Christian influencers

868
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,880
 who are seeing Jesus

869
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,520
 and you're trying to draft off their sight.

870
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,240
 You know you can meet with the Jesus

871
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,280
 that they're meeting with.

872
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,320
 Like you can just go see him for yourself.

873
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,400
 You can sit and meet with him.

874
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,120
 You can hear from him yourself.

875
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,400
 You don't have to hear from him vicariously

876
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,360
 through someone else who is experiencing all the intimacy.

877
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,960
 You can experience the intimacy that they're experiencing.

878
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,400
 See Jesus for yourself.

879
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,600
 So what does that mean?

880
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,440
 What do I mean, see Jesus for yourself?

881
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,560
 I'm just saying, meet with God yourself.

882
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:38,040
 Make time tomorrow to sit down and open up his word

883
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,880
 and say, God, if this is your word,

884
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,020
 would you speak to me as I read?

885
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,780
 I want to hear from you.

886
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:48,400
 And then talk back to him, pray.

887
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,440
 And when you pray, believe he is listening.

888
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,280
 He cares, he is with you.

889
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,740
 He is in the room wanting to meet with you.

890
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,260
 Another question to ask yourself is, are you distracted?

891
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,780
 This weekend I took one of my boys

892
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,320
 on a father-son trip to San Diego

893
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:11,560
 and we rented a Tesla through Turo, which was amazing.

894
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,900
 But this Tesla had a video screen in the back

895
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,240
 and it had YouTube on it.

896
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,240
 And so he was watching YouTube videos

897
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:21,240
 of guys playing Minecraft in San Diego.

898
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,520
 And we left the airport and we're driving into the city

899
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,720
 and I'm looking out and it is gorgeous.

900
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,520
 I mean, I left concrete Dallas

901
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,160
 and I see water and there's boats

902
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,760
 and there's hills and classy architecture.

903
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,160
 And I'm like, hey dude, look at this.

904
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,560
 And he looks up, he's like, okay.

905
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,000
 And then he looks back at his screen.

906
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 I'm like, dude, like this is, he's missing beauty.

907
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,120
 Why? Because he's distracted.

908
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,120
 I just wonder if that's our lives.

909
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,000
 Like the reason you're not seeing Jesus

910
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,200
 is 'cause you're seeing everything else.

911
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,640
 And God loves you too much.

912
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,640
 To show you all of himself

913
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,920
 when you're watching everything else.

914
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,800
 And so what does this look like?

915
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,040
 Maybe it just means, look, if you're meeting with God,

916
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,880
 why would you want to be accessible to anyone else?

917
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,280
 Like turn your phone off.

918
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,840
 It's like for 20 minutes.

919
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,120
 Like why would you care about hearing from any influencer

920
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,840
 when you can meet with the God who made the influencer?

921
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,960
 And if he wants to meet with you, who cares?

922
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,840
 If anyone else wants to meet with you.

923
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,240
 So just shut it off.

924
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,400
 Like don't sit at your kitchen table

925
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,520
 when all your roommates are trying to cook breakfast

926
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,880
 and get out of the place.

927
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,400
 Like be alone, get alone with God.

928
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,520
 Drown out the distractions so that you can see him.

929
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,640
 And then the last question I'd encourage you to answer

930
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,520
 is are you glancing instead of gazing at Jesus?

931
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,560
 This is a wording from A.W. Tozer.

932
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:08,920
 Like are you just kind of quickly glancing at him

933
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,240
 or are you seeking to gaze at him?

934
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,640
 Like no one's love story is you know what,

935
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,800
 I pass by her running on the Katy Trail

936
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,880
 every Monday, Wednesday, Friday afternoon

937
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,920
 and I said hey to her every time

938
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,720
 and now we've been married for 20 years.

939
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,520
 Like whose story is that?

940
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,920
 No one's.

941
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,320
 'Cause no one meets and falls in love by a quick glance.

942
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,920
 Hey, I don't know your name, hey.

943
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,560
 No, you gotta ask someone out.

944
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,880
 This isn't even a dating talk.

945
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,640
 You should ask someone out, maybe.

946
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,520
 You ask someone out, you take them out.

947
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,080
 You go to dinner.

948
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:51,360
 Like you look at them in the face.

949
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,360
 You get to know them.

950
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,800
 You ask them questions.

951
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,800
 And as you gaze at them, you know what happens?

952
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,800
 Is it cultivates your heart for them.

953
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,440
 And so I'll just tell you this to say like

954
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,280
 I've shared this before but

955
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,600
 quality time comes from quantity of time.

956
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:20,400
 Like my relationship with my kids,

957
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,120
 it's not based on me hanging out with my kids

958
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,400
 for five minutes a day.

959
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,160
 Like no dad is like you know what,

960
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,320
 I'm crushing it for just five minutes a day.

961
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,840
 I'm a great dad.

962
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,560
 I feel super connected to my kids.

963
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,160
 Kat and I's marriage, man, it is soaring.

964
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,280
 Why, five minutes a day?

965
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,960
 Just hang out five minutes.

966
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,080
 It's amazing, best five minutes of my day.

967
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:49,040
 No, quality time, it's birthed out of quantity of time.

968
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,880
 So my encouragement is just look at your schedule.

969
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,920
 Change your priorities and just create more space for God.

970
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,920
 Why, so you can see Him.

971
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,320
 Like get where you can see Him.

972
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,320
 Sit until you see Him.

973
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,680
 And so what's your response gonna be to Jesus?

974
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,120
 What is the right response to the gift of Jesus?

975
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,760
 If you're here tonight and you're not a Christian,

976
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,920
 I wanna encourage you to investigate Him.

977
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,560
 Maybe it's you just take the next 21 days

978
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,040
 and you read one chapter of John a day for 21 days

979
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,120
 just to investigate Him.

980
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,760
 Don't be like my boys on movie night.

981
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,320
 Don't dismiss something

982
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,160
 that you have never become familiar with.

983
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,760
 If a miracle is happening in your life tonight,

984
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,600
 would you receive them?

985
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,200
 Like don't leave here.

986
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,080
 If God brought you here for you to know Him, receive Him.

987
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:46,280
 And then behold Jesus.

988
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,880
 If you're a follower of Jesus Christ,

989
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,480
 I just wanna encourage you to behold Him.

990
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,480
 Maybe you just stay right where you are tonight.

991
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,320
 You don't rush out.

992
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,200
 Maybe you go up to the prayer chapel

993
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,800
 where we're gonna have extended worship tonight.

994
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,880
 Maybe you go out and you go to the loft

995
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,040
 and you go to next steps because you just want to know more

996
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,920
 how you can take next steps with Jesus in His church,

997
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,040
 but behold Him tonight.

998
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:16,080
 The gift of Jesus deserves the right response.

999
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,640
 Investigate Him, receive Him.

1000
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,720
 Behold Him.

1001
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,720
 Let's pray together.

1002
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:27,120
 Lord Jesus, my hope and prayer is that every person

1003
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,680
 in this room tonight would take a step with you.

1004
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,360
 God, that no one would leave here unmoved.

1005
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:39,200
 God, for the person who's not a Christian,

1006
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,760
 Lord, I pray that you would just take them

1007
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,360
 on a journey of investigation.

1008
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,560
 And as they investigate, I pray that they would find you.

1009
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,800
 God, for the Christian, I pray that even now

1010
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,160
 you would open their eyes to see you more clearly.

1011
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,240
 And then for the person who doesn't know you,

1012
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,360
 but is here because you have drawn them here.

1013
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,880
 Miracle is happening in their life.

1014
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,840
 If that's you right now,

1015
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,760
 just wanna invite you in this moment

1016
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,400
 to just repeat after me in the quietness of your own heart.

1017
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,840
 This isn't a rabbit's foot prayer.

1018
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,200
 I'm just trying to help you articulate to God

1019
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,040
 what you know to be true.

1020
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,080
 You can just say, "Lord Jesus,

1021
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,000
 "would you come into my life tonight?"

1022
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 Just say, "I want a relationship with you.

1023
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
 "Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me.

1024
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,640
 "Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.

1025
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,840
 "Would you forgive me of my sins?

1026
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,120
 "And would you lead me in a new life

1027
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,360
 "with you as my savior and my king?"

1028
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,120
 Lord, we need you.

1029
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,600
 We love you.

1030
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,640
 God, I pray that over the coming weeks,

1031
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,560
 we would be a people who behold your beauty.

1032
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,520
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1033
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,820
 Amen.

1034
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:58,820
