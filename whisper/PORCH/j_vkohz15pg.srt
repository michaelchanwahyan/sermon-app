 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 All right, well let's go! Welcome everybody in the room!

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Everybody tuning in wherever you are joining us from.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 And I want to welcome PortsLive, Fort Worth, Midland, Indy, Boise.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 We are kicking off a brand new series, Anti-Suppressants.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 What does that mean? I'll explain in a second.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Let me read the text that we're going to be in tonight and then give us a little bit of a recent event in my life

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 that will set us up for where we're going really in this series.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 This comes from Matthew chapter 18. It's a conversation between Jesus and his disciples.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 And here's what happens. Verse 21.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 "Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, 'Lord, how often should I forgive someone who sins against me?

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Up to seven times?' 'No, not seven times,' Jesus replied, 'but seventy times seven.'

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 'Therefore,'" and he launches into a parable or a story or an analogy to explain what he means.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 "'The kingdom of heaven can be compared to a king who decided to bring his accounts up to date

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 with servants who had borrowed money from him.'"

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 So he's got a lender, gave out some money, time to settle those debts.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 "'In the process, one of the debtors was brought in who owed him millions of dollars.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 He couldn't pay, so his master ordered that he be sold, along with his wife, his children,

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 everything he owed, to pay the debt.'"

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 That's a bad day.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 "'But the man fell down before the master and begged him, 'Please be patient with me. I will pay it all.'

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Then the master was filled with pity for him, or mercy, and he released him, and he forgave his debt.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 But when the man left the king, he went and found a fellow servant who owed him a few thousand dollars.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 He grabbed him by the throat and demanded instant payment.'"

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 You better Venmo me right now.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 "'And his fellow servant fell down before him, and he begged for a little more time,

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 and he says the same thing to this man who just had his debt crossed out.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 'Be patient with me. I'll pay you back.'

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 But his creditor wouldn't wait.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 He had the man arrested, put in prison until the debt could be paid in full.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 When some of the other servants saw this, they were upset.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 They went to the king and told him everything that happened.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 The king called in the man.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 He had forgiven and said, 'You evil servant, I forgave you that tremendous debt because you pleaded with me.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Shouldn't you have shown mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?'

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Then the angry king sent the man to prison to be tortured until he had paid all of his entire debt.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 And that's what it will be like with my heavenly father for those of you who refuse to forgive your brothers and sisters from your heart.'"

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 About a year ago, I got given a cooler as kind of a Christmas gift at Watermark one time a year.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Leadership will bust out and give something.

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And it was a cooler, and I didn't have a cooler, especially not like, you know, Yeti coolers.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 And this is like the poor man's version of the Yeti cooler, and that's the Arctic.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 It's supposedly as good as the knockoffs, but dude, I didn't care.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 I needed a cooler, and so this is great.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And so a little bit of time went by, and my family and I, we went on a trip and went out to this friend's lake house,

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 and we brought the cooler, loaded it up with food.

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Everything's going great, great trip, come back home, unpack, move on with life.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Three months later, we're going to go on another trip.

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 I go out to the garage to get the cooler, going to load it back up with food.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 I open up the cooler, and I had left meat for not three days or three weeks, but three months in that cooler.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And it was a smell, and I've got like half of my smell anyways back from COVID,

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 and it was a smell that was overwhelming despite that, and I was like, oh, my goodness.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 So I take the meat out, and my new cooler that I was so excited about, I begin to go into, you know, solution mode.

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 How am I going to get rid of this smell?

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 So I'm looking up on, you know, Googling, how do you get rid of, somebody said you take magazines and rip them up and throw them in there.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 That doesn't work at all.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 I tried other solutions, you know, baking soda in there, washed it out multiple times, and to this day, nothing has worked.

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 It is horrible smelling, and so, yeah, people are going to throw out their solutions.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 We can talk afterwards, but the point is I left in this container something from the past, something from an event, and it contaminated it.

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 In other words, in just a little bit of time, something that was left over from a past event was left inside,

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 and it led to impacting the future use of this cooler and contaminated it.

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Now, what does that have to do with what we're going to talk about?

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Well, our heart in this series is that in a very similar way that someone can leave something in a cooler,

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 and without removing that or dealing with it, over time, you're going to see, experience the effects of it.

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 In a similar way, all of us are on a journey called life, and in the midst of life, there are certain events that happen,

65
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 and they leave something inside of not a cooler but of our heart and of our soul,

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 and if they're not dealt with, they're going to contaminate and impact the future.

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 So our series in this series is to not suppress those things.

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Everyone's familiar with antidepressants and people who've experienced a battle depression,

69
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 and this is not about that at all. It's about antisuppressants, which is God's design for healing,

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 and part of the antisuppressant, in other words, that you would not suppress some of those events,

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 some of the deep pain that you've experienced in life, and in order to do that, you can't suppress it.

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 You've got to address it, and that's what we're going to walk through inside of this series,

73
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 and I think God is going to do something in some of your lives that you're going to look back for the next 40 years,

74
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 and it will be you applying God's Word as we're going to examine it from the Scripture.

75
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 That's going to change the trajectory of your future marriage, the future parenting,

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 the future life that you're going to have because of what he's going to do in this series.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Candidly, a few weeks ago, we had a night where we had this moment of talking about shame

78
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 and how in Christ, we're free from anything defining us other than Jesus.

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 If you're a Christian, whatever your story is, whatever your past sin, present sin, future sin,

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 we're no longer defined by those shames, and we just had all of us write out on different index cards,

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 and we threw them in these boxes saying, "That doesn't define me anymore."

82
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And our team, I told you, was going to go through and just pray over and pray that God would give you the freedom

83
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 to believe that and release that.

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And as we went through and read them and just prayed over, it was very abundantly clear.

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 The amount of pain, trauma, hurt that is represented in all of our stories.

86
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 And nobody in life often teaches us how do we deal with that.

87
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 You go through school and you learn how to do algebra, but nobody teaches you how do you deal with the fact

88
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 that your dad wasn't ever around.

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 How do you deal with the fact that you had people make comments about you at a young age,

90
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 and that created an insecurity that led to an eating disorder for years?

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 How do you deal with the fact that you never got the affirmation from a parental figure in life,

92
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 and so you've been looking for it anywhere you can find it, only to come up empty?

93
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 How do you deal with big and small hurts?

94
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And so tonight I want to talk about the conversation of forgiveness, and let me just open it up.

95
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 This is such a huge topic and has such life-changing, trajectory-changing importance

96
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 that we're going to cover two weeks.

97
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 It just was too much to cover a high-level understanding of why we forgive as Christians,

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 what it even means to forgive, which is what we're going to cover tonight,

99
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 and then very practically how we're going to forgive.

100
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 So if you leave tonight and you're like, "Man, I feel like I kind of left something on the table,"

101
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 that's because this is a message that is broken down into two parts,

102
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 where we're going to look through what God says about forgiving.

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 But this message and the idea of forgiveness and the ability to forgive is going to shape your future marriage.

104
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Candidly, the reason why some of you are going to end up not making it in marriage

105
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 or the relationship will fall apart is because you will not have put into practice

106
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 the ability to get rid of bitterness, to deal with hurts.

107
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And so we're going to walk through, again, a powerful, profound teaching that Jesus gives,

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 and tonight we're going to cover why we forgive and look at three reasons the Bible commands as Christians.

109
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 If you're not Christian, man, this doesn't apply to you. You're welcome.

110
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 We're so glad that you're here.

111
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 But I'm talking very specifically to Christians who have been called by God to practice the habit of forgiveness.

112
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 So I'm going to walk through these three things again that we see in Matthew 18

113
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 as we look at what Jesus' radical teaching on forgiveness says.

114
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And it starts with Peter coming up to Jesus and asking him a question.

115
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Remember the question before he launches into the story?

116
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 He says, "Lord, how many times, if somebody wrongs me,"

117
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 I don't want to mean names or name names. I'm talking about James, John, Bartholomew.

118
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 "If they wrong me, how many times do I forgive them?

119
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Like, where's the line? When do I begin to go, 'Nope, uh-uh, out of my life, forget you, I'm done' up to seven times?"

120
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Now, my hunch is that Peter is saying this thinking, like, I'm patting myself on the back,

121
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 that I would be so generous to do seven. Why do I say that?

122
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Because rabbinic teaching or the teaching of the time was up to three times.

123
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And Peter says, "I'm not just doing three. I'm going to double it, plus one.

124
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 How do you like them apples? What do they look at me now?"

125
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And Jesus says, "No, Peter, not seven times. Seventy times seven times."

126
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 As in translation, there's no end to the call to forgive.

127
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 The first reason that you and I are to forgive, or reason why, is because God has commanded it.

128
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 And now, let me unpack exactly why that's important before I explain what forgiveness is.

129
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Because the reason people balk at, "Oh, God commanded it. That feels so invalidating,"

130
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 is because you think that forgiving is forgetting or pretending it didn't happen.

131
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 That's not what forgiveness is. In a second, we're going to talk about what it is.

132
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 But first, I want to establish, if you were a follower of Jesus, and I mean a Christian,

133
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 you are commanded to forgive continuously, to forgive when people sin against you.

134
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 What do I say if you're a Christian?

135
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Candidly, there's a lot of people who have the title of Christian.

136
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 You may say, "Man, I'm a Christian."

137
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 But if you don't live out the lifestyle of forgiving, it may be that you are not a Christian.

138
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Jesus, all throughout his teaching, says, "Hey, this is what's going to mark my people."

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 In fact, when he teaches on prayer, he's like, "Here's how you should pray."

140
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be your name."

141
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 He goes through the Lord's Prayer.

142
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Inside of the prayer that he says, "Here's how you pray.

143
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Forgive us our debts as we forgive other people."

144
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 That it's at the heart of following Jesus, is I am continually called to forgive people in my life.

145
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 The first idea and the first reason is why, because Jesus commands it.

146
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 When do I forgive?

147
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Every time someone sins against you.

148
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Here's what that means.

149
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Every person around you right now, every person you've ever met, is a sinner.

150
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Myself, your mom, every person here, everyone you've ever met is someone that is going to sin.

151
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Jesus says, "There's no end."

152
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 When you ask the question, "How many times do I allow the person who cut me off in the road,

153
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 or the person who posted that thing on Instagram that I disagreed with,

154
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 or how many times do I forgive my sibling, or how many times do I forgive my parents?"

155
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 How many times did Jesus say, "You never stop forgiving, that you are called to forgive continually."

156
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 He's not saying to take abuse.

157
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 And I'll explain why I say that, which people hear because they don't understand what the Bible means

158
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 when it says forgiveness.

159
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 There's a lot of misunderstanding about that.

160
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 But I just want to establish up top that he calls us continuously to forgive.

161
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 The co-worker that offended you, the friend that betrayed you, this is why cancel culture,

162
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 the world around us, somebody says the wrong thing, mentions, posts the wrong thing, makes a mistake,

163
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 you're canceled.

164
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 For Christians, it's sin.

165
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Because we're called to love people, and love bears all things, hopes all things,

166
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 believes all things, endures all things.

167
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 And for the world around, cancel the latest person or whoever that is, man,

168
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 that's just them fulfilling their job description.

169
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 This is what people who don't know Jesus do.

170
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 But for people who do, you and I are to be continuously forgiving, gracious,

171
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 when people intentionally or unintentionally hurt us.

172
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 It's pretty radical teaching.

173
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 And if you're sitting there going, but you don't know my story, and you don't know what he did, I don't.

174
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 But God does.

175
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 And he's the one who's commanding that.

176
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 And he's doing so because he loves you.

177
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 And I'll explain why I say that here in a second.

178
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 But the first idea is that you and I are to continually forgive people.

179
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And why this is really hard is because there are some real deep wounds here.

180
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Some of you guys had your purity taken from you.

181
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And it wasn't your fault.

182
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 But it's now part of your reality.

183
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And God is not saying that's right or his desire.

184
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 But he has called all of us to forgive.

185
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Some of you guys, like you just had bad parents.

186
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 And it wasn't right.

187
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 And your mom's still to this day like she's passive aggressive and your dad's controlling and they just weren't good parents.

188
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 And God didn't want that or desire that for you.

189
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 But here's what you've got to know.

190
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 You've got to forgive them.

191
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 It's a part of you healing.

192
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 The person who introduced you, maybe like me, to pornography at a young age, and that played a huge -- I mean, that shaped the next decade of my life.

193
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 And part of you experiencing freedom from that involves forgiving.

194
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 In my house, from time to time, you know, vacuum up and everyone's seen -- there's the big vacuums and then there's hand-held vacuums.

195
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 And when you've got little kids, you just bust these out because it's a lot more convenient when they're constantly dropping Cheerios all the time.

196
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 And I've noticed something about these small hand-held vacuums.

197
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 This small nozzle, and particularly like I said, when you're dealing with Cheez-Its and Goldfish and all of that, something will get lodged inside of it.

198
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And you know what happens whenever you get something lodged, clogging up part of the suction on it?

199
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 It decreases the efficiency of the vacuum.

200
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 In other words, it makes it less able to do the thing it was created to do.

201
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Less able to operate it, its full potential.

202
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 And not only that, when something gets clogged in there, it doesn't just decrease its efficiency,

203
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 it makes it more likely that something else is going to get clogged in there too and get stopped, unless you deal with it.

204
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 And in words that I will fail to communicate, my heart for you, just as somebody a little further down the road, is that you would deal with it.

205
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 There are things that are getting lodged in, and to use that example,

206
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 it's not only decreasing your potential to be all who God called you to be,

207
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 it's also increasing the likelihood of other things getting lodged in your heart.

208
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 In other words, you're more sensitive, you're more quick to be offended,

209
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 you have more things that are getting lodged in there, because you haven't practiced the habit of forgiveness.

210
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Whenever I do somebody's marriage, and from time to time people will ask and say, "Will you do our wedding?"

211
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 A question I ask every time two couples or a couple is in front of me,

212
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 "Is there anyone that either of you have not forgiven?"

213
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 And almost always, it's either, "No, we have," or it's apparent.

214
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 And I say as lovingly as I can, "I cannot do your wedding unless you forgive them."

215
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Why? Well, first, because God commands it, but also because I'm going to be a part of a wedding ceremony

216
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 where you two are going to promise to love and sacrifice and serve one another,

217
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 and you hold bitterness in your heart, which makes you more likely to hold bitterness when he hurts you,

218
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 or when she hurts you, because you know it's going to happen, right?

219
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 That's what marriage is. It's two sinners coming together.

220
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 As Billy Graham famously once said, "What makes a good marriage? Two great forgivers."

221
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 And so if you haven't worked through and you're holding on to bitterness,

222
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 it's only going to continue to show up in your life.

223
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 And God who loves you wants you to experience freedom from that.

224
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 The first reason why is because we're commanded.

225
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And then Jesus launches into this story, and it's a pretty profound story, but I'll recap as a reminder of it.

226
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 He basically says, "Peter, let me tell you a story. It's like the kingdom of heaven.

227
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 We're talking God's kingdom, ready?

228
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 There was a man, king, had a lot of cash, lent it out to a bunch of people.

229
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 One guy owed millions and millions and millions of dollars."

230
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 In fact, other translations hold it that it would have been closer to a billion dollars that this man was in debt.

231
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 This guy had hit Vegas way too many times, and he's in debt hundreds of millions of dollars.

232
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 And he goes and the king says, "Hey, time to pay up? Bring me my money."

233
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 The guy says, "Man, I can't pay it."

234
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 The king says, "All right, well, we're going to sell him, sell his house, his wife, his kids, sell the cat, sell it all.

235
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 We're going to get that money back."

236
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 The guy throws himself at his feet and says, "Please, give me some time, I'll pay it."

237
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 There's no amount of time where this guy could have ever paid that back.

238
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And the king says, "You know what? I forgive you. I am having mercy on you."

239
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 And the guy has got to be ecstatic.

240
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 I mean, this is like, this is a better day than every student loan or car note in this room, boom, gone.

241
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 He's ecstatic, and he runs home, and he runs out.

242
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 On his way home, after being forgiven hundreds of millions of dollars, he sees, you know, an old boy that owes him a few thousand.

243
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 He's like, "Hey, hey, where's my money? Give me my money, give me my money."

244
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Grabs him by the throat.

245
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 And the guy says, "Just give me a little time."

246
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Now, the guy could have paid that debt back.

247
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 But he says, "No time has him taken away, put in prison."

248
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 And Jesus is saying that the king calls him in and says, "After the enormous forgiveness of your debt that I gave to you, you would not forgive him?

249
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 That's how you respond?

250
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Then you're going to spend, trapped in that debt for the rest of your life."

251
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Now, what's the point that Jesus is making?

252
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Because then he says, "Hey, this is, all of my followers will not act like this man."

253
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 The second reason why we forgive is because God has forgiven us.

254
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 The second reason why, as Christians, you and I are called to forgive, and this one is the hardest to wrap our minds around, is because of the enormous debt.

255
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 That's the point Jesus is making.

256
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 He's like, "Everybody that sinned in your life, no matter how painful it felt, and it was real, and it was painful.

257
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 It pales in comparison to the infinite debt that you and I have, and have created against God."

258
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And God, through Jesus on the cross, said, "I'm covering all of it.

259
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 It is paid for.

260
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 It is finished.

261
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And so for me to hold on to a grudge, or hold on to bitterness in my heart towards someone else, makes me like the servant."

262
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 And Jesus says, "My people forgive because they've been forgiven.

263
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 The forgiven forgive people."

264
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 The second reason why you and I are called, or why we forgive, is because of God's forgiveness in us.

265
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 And I'm going to unpack why that is so hard for us to understand, but why it's true.

266
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 But first I want to explain really quick what forgiveness is, because this is where people get lost.

267
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 They think, "Man, forgiving is forgetting.

268
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Forgiving is pretending it didn't happen.

269
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Forgiving is dismissing."

270
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 And so let me cover first what forgiveness is.

271
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Based on the story, it's a perfect example.

272
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Because Jesus says, "Here's what forgiveness is.

273
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 It is releasing the demand for payback."

274
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 It is releasing not the feelings, not the fact that it happened.

275
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 It is declaring, "Oh, it's real and it happened.

276
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 But I'm releasing my demand for payback to God.

277
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 I am trusting that God and His Word, which tells me that every sin and action and abuse and hurt, harm,

278
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 will either be paid for by that person for all of eternity in hell,

279
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 or was paid for by Jesus on the cross.

280
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 And I'm releasing the demand for payback to God."

281
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 So forgiveness is releasing the debt, the demand for payback.

282
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 And next week, we're going to walk through really, really practically how do you do that.

283
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 But first, I just want to establish, that's what forgiveness is.

284
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Forgiveness is not excusing sin.

285
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Forgiveness or sin is such a big deal that Jesus bled out on a cross for it.

286
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 In other words, it's not pretending, "Oh, it just wasn't a big deal. Don't worry about it."

287
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 It is a huge deal. Sin is such a big deal, Jesus died.

288
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 So it's not pretending that it's not a big deal.

289
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Forgiveness is not forgetting. In fact, it requires remembering.

290
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Because in order for me to say, "You did this, it created a debt.

291
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 You took from me.

292
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 You took away years. I'm never going to get back.

293
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 You took away my virginity, and then you cheated on me.

294
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 You took away having a mom in the house.

295
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 And I'm not pretending it didn't happen.

296
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 But I'm releasing the demand for payback to God.

297
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 It's not forgetting. In fact, it requires remembering.

298
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Because it's saying, "It happened."

299
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 And I'm releasing and trusting God with that.

300
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Forgiveness is also not denying your hurt or your anger.

301
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 You should be hurt. You should be angry.

302
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Sin makes God angry to see his children hurt.

303
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Forgiveness is also not conditional.

304
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 In other words, it doesn't require the other person asking for it.

305
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Or to own their part, or even be present.

306
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 In other words, the idea, and this is a really common belief,

307
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 is like, "Man, I will forgive them as soon as they ask for it."

308
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 That's not a biblical idea.

309
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 There's people in your life, they're never going to ask for it.

310
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 There's people you don't even know that you're offended by,

311
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 that cut you off at the airport yesterday, and you're like, "Unbelievable. How dare you?"

312
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 And they're gone, and it still messed up the rest of your day,

313
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 and put you in a bad mood.

314
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 And so it doesn't require the other person being involved.

315
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 It requires you deciding, "I am releasing the demand for justice to God.

316
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 I'm going to trust him with that."

317
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 But this is Jesus' point. He's trying to make the motivation,

318
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 the reason we forgive is because of the forgiveness God has given to us.

319
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 That there's a far greater debt that we had that he canceled.

320
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 He paid for.

321
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And now, out of an overflow of that, we forgive others.

322
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Paul would pick up this idea, and the New Testament picks it up,

323
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 that we forgive following the example of Jesus towards us.

324
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 This is what Ephesians 4, verse 32 says.

325
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another as God in Christ forgave you."

326
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Colossians 3, verse 13 is even more savage. Here's what it says.

327
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 "Make allowances" -- this is so frustrating and relevant.

328
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 "Make allowances for each other's faults."

329
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 There's going to be people in your life, they're going to hurt you,

330
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 they're going to offend you, going to frustrate you, going to let you down.

331
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 "Make allowances for their faults," Paul said.

332
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 "Forgiving anyone who offends you."

333
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 This culture is sick, and a number of things that are offensive to people.

334
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 And Paul says, "You are to be quick to forgive anyone who offends you."

335
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Am I saying that being offended is invalid? No.

336
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 I'm saying we live in a world that, especially coming out of the recent season,

337
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 everyone is offended by everything, and as Christians, we've got to be able to say,

338
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 "Hey, even when I'm offended, I'm choosing to forgive you."

339
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 "Forgiving anyone who offends you."

340
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others.

341
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 In other words, the motivation for forgiving someone

342
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 doesn't come from looking back at the past and how dare you,

343
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 it comes from looking up at the God who forgave you and forgave me.

344
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Now, the question is always,

345
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 "How is our actions created an infinitely greater debt than what happened to me?"

346
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 This is a real, real trauma that has happened in the lives of people in this room.

347
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 And you're telling me that me looking at pornography,

348
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 or me sleeping with my girlfriend, or me getting drunk a little bit too much

349
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 is a greater sin against God than some of the worst events

350
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 that I could have imagined happened to me at such a young age?

351
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 How can that be true?

352
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 The Bible tells us God is holy, perfect.

353
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 A sin against Him is a sin against someone

354
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 who is of the highest and greatest authority and honor.

355
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 And even in our own society, we recognize that a sin against someone,

356
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 the consequence for that sin or action,

357
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 is directly related to the person sinned against.

358
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 What do I mean by that?

359
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 You come down front and you lie to me about where you went to school,

360
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 and you're like, "Yeah, you know, I went to Harvard."

361
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And you really went to like, you know, some technical--

362
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 I'm going to insult somebody, but whatever I say there.

363
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 You really went wherever you went.

364
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 And I find out, I'm like, "That's just weird.

365
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Why would you--I mean, why would you lie to me?"

366
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 You look in the eyes of a federal judge and you lie to him?

367
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 That's called perjury with a five-year prison sentence.

368
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 We understand that the sin against someone,

369
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 the consequence for that is directly related to the person sinned against.

370
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 If you come after the reports tonight, you go to my house in my front yard,

371
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 you trespass on my front yard, I'm going to just be, again, perplexed.

372
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 First, you lie to me about the Harvard thing, and now we're doing the yard thing.

373
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 And maybe frustrated, but if you trespass on the White House front lawn,

374
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 you are going to have a sniper coming after you and face prison time

375
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 because we recognize the level of authority in the person being offended

376
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 as a direct correlation to the consequence there,

377
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 and the same with the infinite, holy, perfect God,

378
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 who every person in sinning doesn't just sin against another person.

379
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 They sin against God, the Scripture tells us.

380
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 And God was so madly in love with you, despite the fact of all the enormous debt that you paid.

381
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 He didn't just cancel the debt by waving a wand like the king in the story.

382
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 He said, "I will cancel the debt by giving my own life for you on the cross

383
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 so that every enormous debt that you have would be paid for and canceled."

384
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 And now, as a follower of Jesus, we extend forgiveness to a world

385
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 because we've been forgiven from our God.

386
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 And the second reason, and the reason why you and I can forgive,

387
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 is because of the forgiveness that we have received in Christ and have been given to Him.

388
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Finally, he goes into, really, I think one of the more important reasons

389
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 why we have got to forgive, where it's going to shape the future of your life.

390
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 In the story, we're told that the king comes and he grabs a man and he says,

391
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 "You know what? If you're not going to forgive that debt, you're going to go and be imprisoned."

392
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 And when you read the story, you're like, "What is the analogy? What is he trying to say?"

393
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 But when you think about it, it's a pretty perfect analogy.

394
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 You know what holding bitterness inside of your heart begins to do?

395
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 When you're angry and you hold frustration, and it's real frustration and real hurt that happened.

396
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 When you begin to hold that in your heart, it begins to put a prison on you.

397
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 It begins to impact the fact that you can't forgive yourself.

398
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 And so the reason why you think that you're damaged goods

399
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 and you could never end up dating somebody like that

400
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 is because you look at your decisions and your history,

401
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 and when it comes to forgiveness, you haven't even forgiven.

402
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 You can't forgive you.

403
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 And then someone comes along in life, and you dated this guy or you dated this girl,

404
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 and the way she treated you was wrong, and you got hurt.

405
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 And in response to that hurt, you just begin to put up walls.

406
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And all of a sudden now, "Man, I just don't trust men. I don't trust girls."

407
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And you've created all these different walls, and that bitterness that got lodged,

408
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 it's impacting your ability to have healthy relationships.

409
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 Maybe it was a friend that came up, and they betrayed you.

410
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Maybe it was a bad friend, and they really hurt you.

411
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 And now you just kind of wall it off, and you're like, "Man, I'm not getting hurt like that anymore."

412
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 And you holding on to that bitterness is holding you back from having real relationships and friendships.

413
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 Like somebody came along in your life, and there's just a million different things.

414
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 And if you want to experience healing, you've got to go, and you've got to decide,

415
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 "I am going to forgive this."

416
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 And you've got to walk through exactly how to do that.

417
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 But you were made fun of when you were in middle school.

418
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 And that created an insecurity in you where you never felt enough,

419
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 and you began to turn to pornography.

420
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 And maybe you're a girl, and you've never told anybody because you just think,

421
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 "Man, girls don't struggle with that, or I can't be open," which is not true.

422
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 But you can trace it all the way back to somebody made some comment about you

423
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 and the way that you look, and you felt inadequate ever since.

424
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 I mean, there's a thousand of them.

425
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Parents, your dad was always working, or your dad was never even there, or he hurts you,

426
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 or you grew up and you were embarrassed about your home.

427
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 And somebody down the street, they made fun of the house that you lived in.

428
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 And you know what happened?

429
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Something shifted, and you went, "I'm never going to be that again.

430
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 I'm going to work, and now you work, and you work, and you're building your business,

431
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 and you're climbing that ladder, and you're doing it because some little

432
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 eight-year-old snot-nosed kid down the street made fun of your house?"

433
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 And I'm not trying to invalidate any of that.

434
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 I'm just saying, how long are you going to live in the shadows of that hurt

435
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 and allow that to fuel who you're going to be, who you're going to become?

436
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 And God is saying, "You have been invited to forgive and release that debt,

437
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 and you can trust me with that."

438
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 The third reason why we forgive is because holding on will hold you back.

439
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 This man is thrown in prison, which is such a perfect picture.

440
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Like, hey, if you're not going to forgive, you're going to live in a prison of your own making,

441
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 and it's going to shape your life.

442
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 And it's not hurting the person that hurt you.

443
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 It's hurting you.

444
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 It's been well said that bitterness is drinking poison

445
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 and hoping it hurts the person who hurt you,

446
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 that it's a toxin that's invading,

447
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 and there's so many different ways that it is shaping who you are.

448
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Somebody -- I mean, just trace -- there's so many analogies,

449
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 there's so many examples of this.

450
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 And I'm not trying to be insensitive, and I'm not trying to invalidate it,

451
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 and I've had to go through and still am working through

452
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 and I have to work through my own hurt.

453
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 And God says, "If you want to experience healing, it's going to involve forgiving."

454
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 A friend of mine hunts -- or lived on a farm growing up,

455
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 and he was out in the country, and they would have these raccoons that would come in,

456
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 and they'd just eat crops that they would have.

457
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 And so they figured out a way to trap raccoons,

458
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 and the way they would do it is they'd hollow out a log,

459
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 and then they'd drill a hole in that log.

460
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 And they would place a shiny object inside of the log,

461
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 and a raccoon would come up, and they would reach their hand in that hole,

462
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 seeing the shiny object, and they would grab it.

463
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Only problem was the hole was only big enough to get the hand through, not to get it out.

464
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 And the next day, my friend would show up,

465
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 and the raccoon is still holding onto that, and he can't let it go.

466
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 He can't get out.

467
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 If he was just willing to let it go, he'd be free.

468
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 But he doesn't understand that.

469
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 And so holding onto it is what's holding him back.

470
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 And the same is true with hurt and bitterness,

471
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 and the things that you've walked through, and they were real.

472
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 And God is inviting you, and our hope in this series is don't suppress it.

473
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Begin to address it, and maybe the biggest, most courageous thing you can decide tonight

474
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 is I don't know how to do that, which we'll cover next week.

475
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 God, I don't even want to do that.

476
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 And maybe you decide, I'm just going to pray, God,

477
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 will you give me the desire to give them what they don't deserve, which is forgiveness?

478
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Because you gave it to me.

479
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 Will you give me the desire, God?

480
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Because I don't have that. I don't want that.

481
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 But I don't want holding onto this to hold me back.

482
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 Another reason demanding payback is impossible is it's impossible.

483
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Here's what I mean.

484
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 How does someone pay you back for being an alcoholic father

485
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 who hurts your mom in front of you and your siblings?

486
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 How do you pay that back?

487
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 How does someone pay you back for the fact that when you were eight,

488
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 you went down and you slept over at a friend's house, and his cousin was there,

489
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 and in the middle of the night, he came in and you were abused, and it was wrong,

490
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 and it began to impact and shape your life?

491
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 How does someone pay that back?

492
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 How does someone pay back the fact that you guys slept together

493
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 and you got pregnant or she got pregnant, and one of you decided,

494
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 man, I think we should get an abortion, and you just felt all kinds of pressure.

495
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 And now every year around what would have been the birthday, you think about that,

496
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 and you've thought about it for six years, and you carry shame.

497
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 How does someone pay you back for that?

498
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 God is saying, "They can't, but you can release that to me

499
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 and know that every sin will either be paid for for all of eternity

500
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 or it will be paid for on the cross."

501
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 And it wasn't right, and God's heart breaks more than any person

502
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 and any parent in this room breaks.

503
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 But what I want for you more than anything is you to experience freedom.

504
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 And why we forgive is because it's commanded.

505
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 It's because God has forgiven us of a far greater debt

506
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 and because holding on to that is only going to hold us back.

507
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 Like, throughout life, we go through life,

508
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 and so much of our soul gets impacted, and somebody offends us,

509
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 and we decide, man, I'm going to hold on to that,

510
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 and I cannot believe that they would say that.

511
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 And my best friend in high school all of a sudden betrayed me,

512
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 and I just begin to hold that, and I'm beginning to carry that weight,

513
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 and then life continues to go on, and something else happens.

514
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 I decide, you know what? I'm not dealing with this anymore.

515
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 My dad wasn't around. I'm not going to do that.

516
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 And you begin to carry weights.

517
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 No one can see them on the outside, but they're weighing your life down,

518
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 and they're going to impact the future of who you are and who you're going to be.

519
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 And then you go through more, and you get into college,

520
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 and there's all kinds of things that showed up at college,

521
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 where all of a sudden that girl you were dating and the friend that you had,

522
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 and piece by piece you begin to pile on and carry and carry.

523
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 And you know what?

524
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 Scripture teaches it's too heavy for you to carry, and you weren't meant to.

525
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 And God has gone to great lengths to give you freedom.

526
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 In our world, there's so little training in talking about what it looks like to forgive.

527
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 If anything, we encourage it, and we validate it.

528
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 And what my heart for you in this series is that maybe you just begin to go,

529
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 "God, I'm not going to live like everybody else, and I want to be free.

530
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 And I don't want to carry this into the next relationship.

531
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 I don't want to just shape the future that I'm going to have.

532
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 I don't want to shape the parenting that I'm going to be.

533
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 I don't want to shape the life and the woman and the man that I'm going to be."

534
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 And the most courageous thing maybe you can do, because maybe you're not tonight ready to say,

535
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 "Man, I am choosing to forgive.

536
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 They took that from me, and they don't owe me anymore."

537
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 Is to say, "God, I want to want to forgive.

538
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 Will you help me?

539
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 Will you, by your Spirit, will you help me?

540
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 God, I want to want to forgive, but if I'm honest, the pain is so real.

541
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 I don't know that I can, and it won't be easy, and it won't be a moment.

542
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 If anything, it's going to be a process, but freedom is possible.

543
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 You can just keep carrying it, and no one will see it on the outside.

544
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 But just like something left over from the past isn't going away, it's not going away.

545
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 Let me pray.

546
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 Father, I pray for friends in the room who have been so hurt by people in authority

547
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 who are supposed to provide and protect them,

548
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 had events happen to them that they wouldn't have chose,

549
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 and it has shaped so much of their life.

550
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 And it wasn't fair, and it wasn't right.

551
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 I pray that you would stir their heart, that maybe they would just say,

552
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 "God, I don't know that I can, but I want to be able to forgive.

553
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 I want to have the desire to want to forgive.

554
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 And so will you help me?"

555
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 And I pray that your Spirit would work in a mighty, powerful way.

556
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 Would you set free, which is what you say you do.

557
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 You say, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."

558
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 And so there's places in all of our hearts of people who have offended us

559
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 and hurt us big and small in ways that have impacted us.

560
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 Would you allow your Spirit to bring freedom and healing to some of the darkest crevices,

561
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 to some of the things that we never told anybody about?

562
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 And I pray for anyone who is at that place of going,

563
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 "Because of what you did for me, Jesus, and you paid for my debt,

564
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 I am choosing not to hold what they did, their sin, against them."

565
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 It was paid for, that you would give them the strength to release that.

566
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 And when those thoughts and feelings pop up again,

567
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 you would give them the strength to release that and to entrust that with you.

568
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 It's far too heavy a thing for us to carry.

569
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 We worship you now in song.

570
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 And we may groom and invite you into our hearts and into our lives.

571
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 Would you have your way, God?
