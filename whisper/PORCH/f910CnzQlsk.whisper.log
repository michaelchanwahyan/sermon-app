[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:18.480]   [ Music ]
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.260]   >> Okay. Hi, Porch.
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.000]   All right.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.580]   Hard to not walk with a swagger with an intro like that.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.340]   That's nice.
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.900]   You got to incorporate that in DC.
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.660]   Man, it is so great to see all of you.
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.620]   And it's just fun to be back in Texas.
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.940]   I'm from here, born, raised.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.380]   My wife and I and kids are up in Washington, DC, which is crazy.
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.740]   COVID just ended there.
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.260]   Apparently, it ended here quite a while ago.
[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.800]   But we're still carrying our masks around and such.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.620]   But this is fun to see us all together.
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.460]   And it's such an honor to be here.
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.420]   And before I jump into the text, we're in tonight,
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.260]   we're going to be in Matthew Chapter 5.
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.860]   If you've got a copy of your scriptures and want to read, I'll be there.
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.300]   If you don't, just listen.
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.340]   But before we get to it, I just want to say, you know, I know this series is hot takes.
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.380]   This is not a hot take.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.780]   This is just a fact.
[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.700]   And that is that David Marvin is a phenomenal leader.
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.180]   And watching him lead this has been inspiring to me.
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.660]   Yeah, you can -- let's keep going because he's done an amazing job
[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.260]   of leading this ministry.
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.620]   And the fact that cities all over the US are taking their cues from you is something
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.540]   that's special.
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.500]   It's special, brother.
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.500]   It's an honor to be here and so grateful to see all your faces.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.820]   So, all right.
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.420]   With that said, let me read a passage about sex and make it weird.
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.980]   Here we go.
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.140]   Matthew Chapter 5, Verse 27.
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.220]   This is Jesus speaking, by the way.
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.860]   He says this, "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.220]   But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.220]   committed adultery with her in his heart.
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.740]   If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out, throw it away.
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.900]   For it is better for you to lose one of your members than your whole body be
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.660]   thrown into hell.
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.260]   If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off, throw it away.
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.380]   For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.620]   into hell."
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.580]   Let me pray for us.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.740]   Well, Father, thank you for every person here, whether they love you and worship was
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.620]   the thing they were looking forward to all week, or whether they're not sure about any
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.980]   of this and they're just here trying to maybe find some answers.
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.140]   I just thank you that we're all here.
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.100]   And there's a possibility tonight to know what our maker thinks about how we're made
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.260]   and how to best live the life we've been given.
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.500]   And so I'm asking for your help, God, would you open our minds and we would
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.740]   understand what it is you're thinking about.
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.700]   And I pray you'd open our hearts that we could feel what you care about.
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.700]   And Lord, I just pray we could be changed as a result of these few minutes.
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.940]   I feel it tonight.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:08.820]   I need your grace.
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.300]   We do.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.340]   We just ask for your grace, God, to teach us, to help us.
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.700]   And I just want to invite you, whether this is like a normal thing for you or not,
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.500]   if you're up for it, maybe take a second here.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.300]   And if you're willing, you just pray for a second and ask him.
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:29.900]   If you're up for it, you talk to God and say, "Lord, please teach me something tonight."
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.340]   And then if you would, please pray for me that the Lord would use me and I'd be
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.340]   helpful to you.
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:44.900]   Well, Father, we love you and we trust you.
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.180]   Use this time, we pray that in Jesus' name.
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.980]   Amen.
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.220]   Well, I fell asleep driving one time.
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.460]   When I was in high school, I was making a long run down to Laredo by myself and woke
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.860]   up bumping along the side of the road and did what a lot of people do,
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.060]   overcorrected in a panic, spun my truck 180, a miracle that I didn't kill myself
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.500]   or anybody else.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.060]   But as I kind of hit reverse and got back into the right direction and had to keep
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.180]   going because I was in the middle of nowhere in Texas, I realized I need
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.340]   something to keep me awake and the music I brought along is not doing it.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.900]   And so I remembered that a mentor of mine, like a college kid at the time,
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.060]   had encouraged me to listen to these sermons.
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.380]   He had given me these sermons and said, "Hey, man, you need to listen to these."
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.820]   And I remember just thinking that was the strangest thing ever,
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.460]   like who listens to a sermon in a car?
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.020]   But I brought them and then suddenly I thought, "Well, you know what?
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.220]   I need to stay awake.
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.500]   Maybe listening to someone talk will help, but I got to find something that's going
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.300]   to keep me conscious."
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.540]   And so I opened this thing and looked at all these titles and in the middle of it,
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.660]   there was a talk entitled, "Sex."
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.380]   And I thought, "That ought to do it."
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.420]   And so I put it in and started playing it and the craziest thing happened about
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:09.420]   midway through it, I started crying, like an embarrassing, snotty cry.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.140]   And it wasn't because he was shaming me at all.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.300]   There was no finger wagging and the whole thing.
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.980]   He was just actually unpacking the book, "The Song of Solomon," the book of love
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.460]   in the Old Testament, and just painting the picture of what the enjoyment of the
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.340]   gift of sex was meant to be like.
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.140]   And I started crying, I realized, because the image I had been given and the
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.420]   assumptions I'd been given by pornography, which was introduced in my life at a
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.700]   fairly young age, was such an anemic and distorted view.
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.180]   I realized I had such a small view of what sex is meant to be.
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.660]   And so I cried over the loss of a beautiful picture and the possibility
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.020]   of discovering it again.
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.740]   And so as I say that, I read you the language of Jesus from the Sermon on the
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.300]   Mount, and I want to get into what Jesus is saying about it.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.980]   But before that, I want to pick up where David and JD had left off a little bit in
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.100]   talking about the subject to really just make the point before we get into what
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.420]   Jesus is doing, which is kind of restricting some expressions of sexuality.
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.860]   I want to talk about the reality that I think many of you know, maybe some of you
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.020]   don't though, but that the Scriptures are not prude when they talk about sexuality.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.980]   Actually, they're more bold-faced than often we are or even comfortable talking
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.900]   about in spaces like this.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.860]   The book of "Song of Solomon," if you've never read it, is this book of great love
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.780]   and celebrating sexuality.
[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.500]   It's fun, and sex is meant to be fun.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.020]   You see the guy at the beginning is likened to a gazelle, and he's just leaping
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.820]   towards the woman's house, very excited.
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.380]   All right, she's saying, "Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth."
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.580]   She's very excited.
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.180]   It gets to their wedding day, and you see that he's riding towards her in this
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.380]   luxuriant couch surrounded by soldiers.
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.660]   That man, she feels protected and she feels provided for.
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.100]   And then you show up at the wedding, and then the book does not drop off at the
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.140]   door of the bridal chamber.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.220]   It walks you right into it.
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.500]   And as you walk into that chamber, he begins to compliment her,
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.020]   and he starts with her hair, and then moves down to her eyes, and her nose,
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.460]   and her mouth, and her neck, and he travels down her body.
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.220]   And you get into Song of Solomon 4.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.220]   I'll just read you some of this.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.220]   This ought to be fun.
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.220]   In Song of Solomon 4, 5, he says, "Your two breasts are like two fawns,
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.140]   twins of a gazelle that graze among the lilies."
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.300]   Why does he call her breasts deer?
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.620]   Well, the idea is you don't run up fast on fawns.
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.620]   You're not like, "Hey, fawns."
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:37.100]   Like, there's a gentleness to the entry into their sexuality.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.900]   And he says, "Until the day breathes and the shadows flee,
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.220]   I will go away to the mountain of Myrrh and the hill of frankincense."
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.620]   Let me tell you, if you were to look at the maps in the back of your Bible and try
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.820]   to find in Israel the mountains of Myrrh and the hills of frankincense,
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.020]   you won't find them.
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.540]   They don't exist there geographically.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.460]   Earlier in the book, she says that she kept a little satchet
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.260]   of perfume between her breasts.
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.580]   So when he says, "All night long, I'm going to the mountains of Myrrh,"
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.700]   he's not talking about a place out of town.
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.220]   He's gearing up for good times.
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.620]   And as he says it, he's talking.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.220]   And he says, "You are altogether beautiful, my love.
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.220]   There is no flaw in you.
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.100]   Come with me from Lebanon, my bride.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.500]   Come with me from Lebanon.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.740]   Depart from the peaks of Amman and from the peak of Sinair and Hermon,
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.500]   from the dens of the lions, from the mountains of leopards."
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:30.860]   He said, "Let's get away from a context where you just want to be devoured.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.740]   That's a wild animal.
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.900]   Let me just use and devour you."
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.460]   He said, "Let's get away from that world.
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.980]   Let's steal away to a secret place that's life-giving for us."
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.060]   And as he speaks to her, he says, "You have captivated my heart,
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.540]   my sister, my bride.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.580]   You've captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes and with one jewel
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.580]   of your necklace."
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.980]   He calls her sister, not because they were biologically related,
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:57.420]   but because they had such a deep connection of friendship and familial love
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.860]   that's now blossoming into erotic love.
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.180]   That he calls her in other places, a word you could translate,
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.980]   "best friend."
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.060]   She's his friend.
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.020]   But as he speaks to her, he says, "Your love is much better than wine,
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.860]   the fragrance of your oils than any spice.
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.380]   Your lips dripped nectar, my bride.
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.220]   Honey and milk are under your tongue."
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:23.140]   Honey and milk were the only foods back then that didn't require a death.
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:27.900]   And so he's saying, "This enjoyment of your body, this sexuality has no sorrow
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.500]   added to it.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.900]   There's no death in this place.
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.220]   It's just life.
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.780]   It's just life."
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.460]   He tells her in verse 12, he compares her body, her sexuality to a garden.
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.620]   He says, "A garden locked is my sister, my bride, a spring locked,
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.260]   a fountain sealed.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.980]   Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranate with all choice fruits,
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:52.140]   henna and nard, nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon with all trees
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:57.820]   of frankincense, myrrhs and aloes with all chief spices, a garden fountain,
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.380]   a well of living water, and flowing streams from Lebanon."
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.580]   He compares her body to this garden.
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.620]   And then she speaks and says, "Awake, oh, north wind.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.140]   Come, oh, south wind.
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.740]   Blow upon my garden.
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.620]   Let its spices flow.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:16.220]   Let my beloved come into his garden and eat its choice fruits."
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.580]   Dang.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.180]   And then the very next verse, he says, "I came to my garden,
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.180]   my sister, my bride.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.740]   I gathered my myrrh with my spice.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.980]   I ate my honeycomb with my honey.
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.020]   I drank my wine and my milk."
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:35.540]   Now, it's unclear how much time elapsed between those two verses.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:40.020]   Could have been three minutes, could have been five, could have been 15 minutes.
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.900]   Commentators aren't sure.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:49.820]   But the point is, the very next statement is not made by him or her,
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.220]   it's made presumably by their friends, maybe by God himself,
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.340]   but this is inspired scripture.
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.020]   I think you could say both.
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:00.300]   The response to this erotic expression is, "Eat, friends,
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.460]   drink, and be drunk with love."
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.180]   That's your Bible.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.500]   What's the Bible's response to sexuality?
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.580]   Eat, drink, get drunk with your love.
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.700]   The Bible's not prude as it speaks of sexuality.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.020]   It's a gift.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.660]   It's a gift that's meant to be enjoyed.
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.700]   And yet, it's also, did you catch, it's compared to a garden.
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:28.780]   And if you look at the text, "A garden locked," it's a walled garden.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:34.100]   The idea of a garden back then is you would nurture exotic plants and fruits,
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.900]   and so it would be wild and exotic and exciting and have fruit that was
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.820]   nourishing and life-giving.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:48.100]   But then it's also walled off, sealed, protected, secret.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:53.140]   And so the picture of their sexuality here is that it's pleasure that's protected.
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.300]   And in the Bible, the boundary is pretty clear that God puts around sex.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.220]   All of us, incidentally, in society put boundaries around sex.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.300]   Well, most all of us do, put boundaries around sex.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.420]   The common boundaries in America today are consent and age.
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:13.300]   In the Bible, the boundary is covenant, that someone says, "I want all of you,
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.460]   not just your body, but I want all of you.
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.020]   I want to know your thoughts.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:17.580]   I want your mind.
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.180]   I want your emotions.
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:18.740]   I want your heart.
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.540]   I want your body.
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.300]   I want our futures and our life and our finances bound together.
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.060]   I'm giving all of me, and I want all of you."
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:29.300]   And as we commit our entire lives together, our sex together is an expression
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.500]   of this covenant that we've made.
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:36.300]   So the Bible kind of blocks sexuality within the boundaries of a covenant of love.
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.260]   And within that covenant of promise to care for you, you're meant to enjoy it.
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.980]   It's meant to be fun.
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.940]   Proverbs 5 says, "Let your fountain be blessed.
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.500]   Rejoice in the wife of your youth, a lovely dear, a graceful doe.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.540]   Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight.
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.980]   Be intoxicated always in her love."
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.020]   A man enjoying his wife's breasts is not necessary for procreation.
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.660]   Like, that's not what he's saying there.
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.420]   He's saying, "Have fun.
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.380]   Enjoy it.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.260]   It's a gift."
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.620]   But he says earlier, "Should your springs be scattered abroad,
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.100]   streams of water in the streets."
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.860]   He says, "Enjoy that garden within its protective boundaries.
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.940]   Don't let it flow out into the streets."
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.820]   And I say all that because that was the context of Jesus' preaching that people
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.020]   would have about sexuality.
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.340]   And Jesus kind of picks it up and talks about that.
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.220]   "Enjoy, but within the confines.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.300]   Why let the springs flood the streets?"
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.340]   So he says in verse 27 of the passage I read in Matthew 5,
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.260]   "You've heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'"
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.980]   He's quoting the 7th and the 10 Commandments.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.260]   Adultery is somebody who's married having sex with somebody who they're not
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:40.980]   married to.
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.940]   And he says, "This is a boundary."
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.820]   And incidentally, this is a boundary that almost all Americans agree with,
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.140]   that if you've made a covenant of marriage with somebody,
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.340]   you should not take your sexuality outside that covenant.
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:57.100]   There's a nationwide study called Relationships in America that conducts a
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.260]   study all across America to talk about the nature of our relationships.
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:05.700]   And in that, a phrase was offered up, "It's permissible for a married person to
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.340]   have sex with someone other than their spouse."
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.900]   10% of men in America in this survey said, "Yes."
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.180]   5% of women said, "Yes."
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:20.260]   So 90% of men in America, 95% of women agree with Jesus here.
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.420]   It is not right for someone who's married to have sex with someone who's not their
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:23.740]   spouse.
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:28.500]   So I'm not going to belabor that verse because most of America already believes
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:28.940]   that one.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:32.700]   We agree with Jesus on that one, except for roughly 10% of men.
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.620]   So look out, ladies.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.540]   But Jesus is going to do something pretty crazy in the next verse.
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.620]   He says, "You've heard that."
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.500]   It's in the 10 Commandments.
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.940]   In verse 28, he says, "But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:51.380]   lustful intent has already committed adultery with her, and it's hard."
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.420]   He does something there that, if you really think about it, in the Old Testament,
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.180]   he just takes the seventh of the 10 Commandments and the tenth of "Do not
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.180]   covet" and puts them together.
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:04.540]   So it's not, in a sense, new, but it is an intensification of verse 7.
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.380]   He's paddling upstream from the act of infidelity.
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.180]   And he says, "You know where we need to cut this stream off is all the way back
[00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:19.060]   at images and intent and imagination, how what you take in through your eyes
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.700]   affects your heart."
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:26.660]   He says, "More than action, I want to talk about images and intent
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.860]   and imagination."
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.060]   That's where Jesus puts it.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.500]   What's going on inside your heart, right?
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.940]   And really, what he's doing here is he's creating a very different boundary,
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.700]   a much higher one.
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.940]   You could say it in maybe modern language is what he's doing is he's calling for the
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.460]   end of objectification of women.
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.420]   That's the idea.
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.740]   I think we're more comfortable with some of that language.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:55.780]   But we can say, if Jesus is saying, "Hey, looking at images that are affecting
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:00.940]   your imagination with lustful intent is out of bounds," I think we can acknowledge
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.980]   that's a pretty high bar.
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.660]   Like, that's pretty wild.
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:11.420]   That sexuality is only meant to be enjoyed within the covenant of marriage is very
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.180]   restrictive.
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.180]   And I think if we're honest in the culture today, a lot of people might say,
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.500]   "That's too much.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.500]   That's too restrictive.
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.060]   That's too much."
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.860]   It wasn't that long ago in America, a couple of decades ago,
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.260]   that there was a great sexual revolution that people said, "Hey,
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.020]   these boundaries around sex are too tight.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.300]   We need to kick some of these walls down, loosen up a little bit,
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.380]   and kind of let the streams flow.
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.220]   We got to move it out a little bit, right?"
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.220]   And then as technology caught up in the '80s and the '90s, this loosening of sexual
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.260]   boundaries really took off through technology and has created, I think,
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.780]   today, a really different world for you and for me.
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.580]   And so, what I want to do in the rest of our time is not really talk about sex so
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:51.620]   much, we talk about what Jesus is talking about, imagery that's affecting our
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:57.180]   imagination, what we see with our eyes that's affecting our hearts.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:01.460]   Because there's been a shift in the world today, particularly for your generation
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.260]   to deal with.
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.780]   And so, I want to look at the proliferation of sexual imagery,
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.340]   the problems it creates, the principle Jesus lays out,
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.700]   and the practices that he would recommend.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:16.540]   Now, as soon as I say that, let me say this, my goal is not to shame anybody.
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.940]   And that's always the risk when you talk about stuff like this.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.060]   It's like you can see the wave of shame hit people.
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.740]   And it's sad because the reason I started where I did is talking about sex is
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.140]   supposed to be fun.
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.180]   But as soon as we moved to this, I watched the shame hit people's face,
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.180]   and I don't like that.
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.100]   I don't think we feel good about some of how we're handling this gift from God.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.220]   So, let me just tell you, my goal here is not to make anybody here feel ashamed
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:41.940]   or feel bad.
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.980]   I just want to kind of give you the lay of the land of where we are as a culture,
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.220]   assess it, and then show us a different path that Jesus offers us.
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.780]   Does that make sense?
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.620]   So, let's talk about the proliferation of sexualized imagery.
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.220]   Again, Mark Regnerus, who's a research professor at the University of Texas,
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:58.900]   of all places.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.540]   Can you believe I'm quoting a guy from UT?
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.540]   But there it is.
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:05.300]   He studies sexuality, particularly yours, folks.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.380]   And he quotes a lot of information that I'm going to mention here,
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.540]   including this Relationships in America survey.
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.780]   And based on the surveys he looked at, currently in America,
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:22.500]   84% of 14 to 18-year-old males and 57% of 14 to 18-year-old females have
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.300]   viewed pornography.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:28.300]   So, almost all high school-age boys and a little over half high school-age girls.
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:34.540]   So, just to give you, again, where we are as a society, it's now normal for minors
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:40.140]   to watch adults have sex on a screen.
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.460]   Depending on what number you check, the number of explicitly pornographic sites
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.820]   in America consistently rank as some of the most visited websites on the planet.
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.460]   Depending on when you check, it will land often in the top 10.
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:56.700]   I looked at November of 2020 at the top 10 websites viewed around the globe.
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.860]   Number one was Google.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:18:59.780]   It's not surprising.
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:07.980]   Number two, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia, Instagram, Baidu,
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:15.900]   which is China's version of Google, Yahoo, which frankly was surprising.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:22.460]   Number nine was an explicitly pornographic website with 3.4 billion unique views
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.740]   per month.
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.300]   There's only like 6, 7 billion of us walking around here.
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.100]   That's quite a bit.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:35.500]   And number 10 was a pornographic website that gets 3.3 billion unique monthly visits.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.620]   And so, if you combine those last two, those two websites alone are visited more
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.060]   than Instagram or Wikipedia.
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.860]   So, what I'm talking about here is a global phenomenon.
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:51.020]   There's been a big shift on the planet Earth as it relates to sexual imagery.
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.700]   All right?
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.220]   According to Covenant Eyes, the highest percentage of subscriptions to porn sites
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.500]   are found in zip codes that are more urban than rural, have higher than average
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.940]   household income, have a greater density of young people, have a higher proportion
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.860]   of people with undergrad degrees, and have a higher measure of social capital,
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.420]   meaning they like to donate, volunteer, and participate in community projects.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:20.300]   So, basically, a city like Dallas, basically this room.
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:27.540]   If limited to men 18 to 39 years old, this was maybe the most helpful statistic.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.380]   It's hard to kind of read who's struggling with pornography.
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.780]   If you ask somebody that, it's kind of a weird question to ask somebody.
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.980]   So, the way they did it in the survey is ask, "When's the last time you
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:38.540]   intentionally looked at an explicitly pornographic image?
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.140]   When's the last time you did that?"
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:48.700]   46% of men between 18 and 40 said this past week.
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:53.660]   16% of women between 18 and 39 said the same.
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:59.900]   So, within your age bracket, 46% of men, 16% of women said over this past week.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:05.780]   24% of men in America indicated today or yesterday.
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:11.100]   So, almost half of American adult men under 40 are weekly viewers of pornography,
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.060]   about a quarter of them viewed it yesterday or today.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.820]   One commentator said it this way.
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:23.500]   He said, "Men today can see more flesh in five minutes than their great-grandfathers
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:30.860]   could their entire life, searching actively for it."
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.820]   That there's been a big shift in the culture today.
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:37.820]   Now, let me say again, I'm not trying to shame any of you because here's the deal.
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.100]   You didn't make this.
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.580]   I mean, I don't know, maybe some of you did.
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.980]   I don't know where you work.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:49.460]   But based on your age, none of you created this environment.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:53.260]   But the point is, it has affected you.
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.300]   So, this proliferation is new in your day.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.860]   It's unlike anything we've ever seen on the planet Earth before.
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.700]   The same guy who said, "Man, you can see more than your grandfather could
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.300]   in five minutes," he said, "And we are not prepared for that in an evolutionary
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.060]   perspective.
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.940]   You're not ready for it."
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.380]   It's thrown us for a loop.
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:16.180]   So, the proliferation is historic and the problems it's created are fairly acute.
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.820]   Relationally, it's impacted the way we relate to each other.
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.540]   So, that's really I want to talk about in the next little segment here is how it's
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.020]   affect the way we relate to each other.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.100]   And everyone I'm going to quote is not a Christian, doesn't have any kind of
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.940]   religious dog in the fight as they kind of assess what's happening
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:31.980]   in the culture today.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.780]   Naomi Wolf is a self-described liberal feminist.
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:40.500]   She says this, she said, "For two decades, I've watched young women experience the
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.980]   continual mission creep of how pornography has lowered their sense of their own sexual
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.660]   value and their actual sexual value.
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.300]   When I came of age in the '70s, it was still pretty cool to be able to offer a
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.100]   young man the actual presence of a naked, willing young woman."
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.020]   You could get a pretty enthusiastic response by just showing up.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:05.500]   She said, "Well, I'm 40 and mine is the last female generation to experience that
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:11.300]   sense of sexual confidence and security in what we had to offer."
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.940]   She said, "The young women who talk to me on campus about the effect of pornography
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:19.620]   on their intimate lives speak a feeling that they can never measure up,
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.820]   they can never ask for what they want, and if they do not offer what porn offers,
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.540]   they cannot expect to hold a guy."
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:33.500]   So one of the impacts of this proliferation of imagery is an effect on the confidence
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:38.180]   of women in society today, whether they view it or not.
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:43.580]   And the ability to feel that they can hold a guy.
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:47.060]   Jennifer Lawrence, you know, the Academy Award winner, was the victim of hacking.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:51.620]   You remember, she had taken nude photos of herself to send to her boyfriend who
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.780]   lived in another town, and someone hacked it and put them out online,
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.620]   and she was talking to Vanity Fair about that experience.
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.740]   And they asked her, "Why did you even take those photos in the first place?"
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.220]   And this is what she said, "Either your boyfriend is going to look at porn or he's
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.780]   going to look at you."
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:11.860]   That's how she views relationship today.
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:15.540]   And Naomi Wolf comments this way, she says, "Does all this sexual imagery
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.860]   in the air mean that sex has been liberated?
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.860]   Or is it the case that the relationship between the multibillion-dollar porn
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:27.220]   industry, compulsiveness, and sexual appetite has become like the relationship
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:33.340]   between agribusiness, processed food, supersized portions, and obesity?"
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.060]   She said, "Sex has been commodified.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:41.340]   We took it out of the bedroom and we gave it to multibillion-dollar corporations."
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:45.780]   And she said, "So as that's happened, it shifted the way we are able
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.980]   to relate to each other."
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.300]   Christopher Ryan's a guy who wrote a book entitled, "Sex at Dawn,"
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.580]   which I'm not recommending.
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:56.500]   And he's a proponent of non-monogamy, but he was asked in an interview
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.860]   with Vanity Fair about Tinder, and particularly what they were asking
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.900]   about were the problems of sexualized technology.
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.340]   And he says, "It's the same pattern manifested in porn use."
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.940]   He said, "The appetite's always been there, but it had restricted availability.
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.340]   With new technologies, the restrictions are being stripped away,
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.300]   and we see people are sort of going crazy with it.
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.940]   I think the same thing that's happening with this unlimited access to sex partners.
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:21.420]   People are gorging.
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.460]   That's why it's not intimate.
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.140]   You could call it psychosexual obesity," is what he said.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.900]   Now, again, these are people with a liberal sexual ethic.
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.900]   So they're not reading a Bible.
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.580]   They have no, like, moral constraints because of religious convictions.
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.740]   They're just looking at society and saying, "Hey, we kicked down some boundaries,
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.820]   and we're seeing as it spills out."
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:45.300]   It's less like nourishment and more like fast food, and it's creating an isolation.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.900]   So the idea that, you know, do whatever sexually as long as it doesn't hurt
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.940]   someone doesn't really hold because the reality is the lustful gaze,
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:57.860]   unrestrained, is hurting all of us.
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.340]   And Mark Regnerus, I won't go into details now, but he quotes a neuroscientist
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:06.860]   that says, you know, in the past, the porn industry has characterized their
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.060]   opposition as primarily religious.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:14.940]   He says, "But the reality is porn addiction harms human bonding."
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.900]   And I won't quote many more stats.
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:17.460]   We got to move on.
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:24.900]   But the reality is dozens of studies have confirmed that this bathing in sexualized
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:30.060]   images has led to self-reported lower relationship satisfaction,
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:34.140]   lower relationship quality, tend to experience more negative communication
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:37.220]   with a romantic partner, feeling less dedicated to the relationship,
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.220]   less sexually satisfied, more likely to commit infidelity,
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:45.820]   tend to see monogamy as unrealistic, and lower self-esteem in the men and women.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:50.700]   And it's led to earlier sexual debuts in relationships because rather than sex now
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:56.900]   being the culmination of our love, it is now an anchor I throw into a
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.340]   relationship to try to secure the possibility of love.
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:03.460]   So rather than expressing love, it's a thing we introduced earlier,
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.300]   hoping that love will be on the other side.
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.540]   But statistically, what we're seeing among your generation is an earlier sexual debut
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.220]   in a relationship is not a good predictor of the survival of a relationship.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.740]   It's actually a good predictor that the relationship won't survive,
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:20.060]   that all this sex has led us away from each other and from God.
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.180]   That's one of the craziest things.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.300]   Samuel Perry is a sociologist at the University of Oklahoma.
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.460]   Do they have those there?
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.340]   I guess they do.
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.820]   Good for you, Oklahoma.
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:35.460]   The parking lot of Texas.
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.060]   He says there's a direct...
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.460]   I had to throw a joke in there, Oklahoma.
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:40.340]   You got to laugh sometimes to keep from crying.
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:52.060]   But he notes a direct correlation between a relationship with sexualized imagery and
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:56.300]   growth in religious doubt and declining importance of religion.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.460]   Isn't that a fascinating thing that God gave us the gift of sex for bonding?
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.340]   It releases hormones that create bonding.
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.540]   It's meant to reinforce emotional bonding.
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:08.260]   But when we remove it from a relationship with a human and put it into these
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:12.380]   situations where we're just now using it as a commodity, it's actually damaged our
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:17.820]   ability to connect with each other and it's damaged our ability to connect with God.
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:23.620]   That what he created for bonding is now reinforcing isolation.
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:24.580]   Last quote, and then we'll move on.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.580]   Naomi Wolf.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:31.740]   She says, "Mostly when I'm asked about loneliness, a deep, sad silence descends
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.820]   on audiences of young men and young women alike.
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.940]   They know they're lonely together, even when conjoined.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:42.420]   And this imagery is a big part of that loneliness.
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.500]   What they don't know is how to get out, how to find each other again,
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.980]   erotically, face-to-face.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.620]   Other cultures know this.
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.620]   And I'm not advocating return to the days of hiding female sexuality,
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:55.300]   but I'm noting that the power and charge of sex are maintained when there's some
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:29:01.300]   sort of sacredness to it, when it's not on tap all the time.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.260]   In many more traditional cultures, it's not prudery that led them to
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.340]   discourage men from looking at pornography.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.820]   It is rather because those cultures understand male sexuality and what it
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:13.380]   takes to keep men and women turned on to one another over time,
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.060]   to help men in particular to, as the Old Testament puts it,
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.340]   "Rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.260]   Let her breast satisfy thee at all times."
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:26.020]   These cultures urge men not to look at porn because they know that a powerful
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:31.580]   erotic bond between parents is a key element of a strong family.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.540]   Let me just clue you into what you just heard there.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:40.500]   Self-professed, non-religious, liberal feminist just quoted the Old Testament
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.700]   sexual ethic favorably.
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:49.180]   She says, "Maybe there was something to this idea of boundary,
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:55.860]   not as a restrictive septic pond, but as the banks of a river that allow
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.460]   this to flow in a life-giving way.
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.100]   Maybe there was something to this.
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:06.700]   Maybe what we have here, all this liberty, has not brought us freedom.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:11.220]   Maybe this liberation of sexuality has led us to bondage."
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:15.300]   And I would argue to you that a lot of the movements you see in the streets now
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.580]   are so different than what you saw back in the '60s.
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:21.460]   Now the call is for restraint, the Me Too movement.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.020]   That people are saying, "We kicked down some boundaries that maybe
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.140]   should go back up."
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.580]   Now, let me just say, again, it's really different for our generation
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:32.100]   because of the amount of it that's online, but this whole situation is not
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.460]   particularly historically new.
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.660]   Like in ancient Rome, there was a much looser sexual ethic.
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.060]   Men could sleep with whoever.
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.660]   I guess anybody could, but whenever you have a society with a looser
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.420]   sexual ethic, it tends to favor men because they're more interested in sex,
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.780]   and powerful, wealthy men because they have the influence and money
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.860]   to create situations where they get more sex.
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.660]   And so it created a moment where men would exploit women and other men
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.540]   and children for their sex.
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.020]   That happened in ancient Rome.
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.420]   It happens still today.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.940]   A looser sexual ethic is how you get a Harvey Weinstein.
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:07.180]   What's fascinating about ancient Rome is, man, I got really interested in why would
[00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.460]   Romans become Christians?
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.460]   Like, if you were a part of ancient Rome and wealthy and successful,
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.700]   why would you join this fledgling Christian movement where you might
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:15.620]   get killed?
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.540]   Well, this is a neat little club.
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:17.220]   What do you guys do?
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:17.820]   Get murdered?
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:18.380]   I'm in.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.260]   Like, who would join that club?
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.820]   And, you know, one of the most attractive things about the Christian community was
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.220]   their sexual ethic.
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.420]   The fact that the women seemed happier and the men seemed happier,
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.060]   and the children.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.220]   And so it was interesting because Rome would look at them and be like,
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.260]   "Your sexual ethic is backward, regressive, weird, and attractive.
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.660]   You just seem happier than us."
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:43.900]   And one of the things that drew people to Jesus is what Jesus is doing here.
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:44.700]   I'll be honest.
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.140]   When I first read this passage, when Jesus was like, "I tell you,
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.540]   if you even look at a woman, Leslie, you've committed adultery."
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.220]   When I was younger, I was like, "Come on."
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.340]   Like, that's just so like, "You already did it."
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.580]   You're like, "I didn't.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:55.180]   Oh, man."
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:59.860]   Like, it just felt a little too high.
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.460]   But now I realized he isn't being the morality police here.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.300]   He's not measuring the hem of all your dresses like, "Hold on."
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.220]   You know, like, that's not what he's doing.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.900]   He can just see downstream.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:16.580]   The lustful gaze unrestrained is going to lead you to a place where it's harder
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.780]   to meet each other, harder to date, harder to get married,
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:19.940]   and harder to enjoy marriage.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:24.620]   And so Jesus sees the damage downstream and says, "Let's cut it off up here."
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.180]   He's not saying this because he's prude or rude.
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:30.260]   He's saying it because he loves us.
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.580]   Oh, how he loves us.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.780]   And I see it differently that way now.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.620]   So he warns us, and here's the principle.
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:38.540]   He warns us with it.
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.700]   Man, he doesn't start with the bodies.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:45.260]   He goes back to the intent of their eyes and their imagination.
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.180]   What you look at through the eyes affects your heart.
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.220]   And he's quoting Job there.
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.660]   You know, Job 31.1.
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.980]   Job said, "I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a woman."
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.980]   And then he says, "If my heart goes after my eyes and my feet go after a woman,
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:56.740]   may God judge me."
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:57.660]   He understood.
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:01.260]   "What I gaze in in my eyes will stir my heart and move my life."
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.820]   So what do you entertain with your eyes?
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.020]   The book, "Atomic Habits," talks about this.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.180]   You know, maybe in a more kind of business-like language, they talk about
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:14.500]   cues and craving and response and reward.
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:20.380]   That when I see a cue, it kickstarts a craving, and so I respond to get a reward.
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.780]   You see this with food.
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.820]   This was me all through COVID.
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.620]   I would walk through the kitchen and be like, "Oh, cookie."
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.780]   And as soon as I saw it, it kickstarted craving.
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.460]   I want to eat you, right?
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:32.700]   And so then I would do it, and I'd feel the reward.
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:33.940]   I feel good inside.
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.740]   Until I gained about 10 COVID pounds and then was like, "You know what?
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.060]   This costs too much.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.580]   I don't want to keep doing this."
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.220]   But I realized every time I see a cookie, it just starts the cycle.
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.060]   It's like, cue, craving, respond.
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:49.940]   And I realized, "Oh, man, I got to change the cue."
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:53.620]   And what "Atomic Habits" says is, "Man, eliminate the cues from your home,
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.220]   and it'll decrease the cravings," which happened.
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.340]   I told my wife, "You got to get all these snacks out of the house.
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.700]   What are you trying to do to me?"
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.460]   And so we got them out of the house, and what would happen?
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.780]   I would feel it sometimes like, "Oh, I want a cookie.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.060]   But there are no cookies.
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.180]   Oh, man.
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:11.260]   I guess I'll read a book, write a poem, go on a walk.
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:11.980]   I don't know."
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.340]   And what happened?
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.100]   Suddenly, my imagination was freed up.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.220]   You see that?
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:17.940]   Here's one crazy thing.
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:22.700]   I had a friend who was a sex addict and recovering, and he said, "You know what's
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:23.460]   so wild, man?"
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:28.180]   He said, "When I got this stuff out of my life," he said, "my creativity came back."
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:30.340]   He said, "I didn't even know I lost it."
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:33.780]   He said, "But my imagination had been so filled with these images,
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.780]   when I cut the images out, my imagination kick-started in some other areas."
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.020]   He said, "I started writing songs again.
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.340]   I started biking again.
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:41.740]   I started going on trips with friends."
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:46.300]   He said, "It just unlocked some things that I had lost."
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.540]   And he realized, "Man, this was costing me things I didn't want to give up."
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:53.820]   And so he made a change because what goes into the eyes affects the heart.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.460]   These images affect your imagination.
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.900]   So if you want a pure imagination, you got to get a purity to your eyes.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.420]   Now, again, notice here, he talks about lustful intent.
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:05.740]   He's talking about your intent here, the intent of the gazer,
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.580]   because our intent can change, right?
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:11.300]   I remember when I was a youth pastor right out of college, I had all these young girls
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:11.980]   in my ministry.
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:15.380]   Man, when I looked at them, I thought, "Word association,
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:19.100]   people I'm meant to care for, people I'm meant to help, my little sister,"
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.420]   because they looked like my little sister.
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.420]   So I just thought of like, "Young women I want to see flourish under God."
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.220]   And I remember coming and visiting some buddies up here in Dallas,
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:30.980]   and my same age, and some girls walked by same age, and they started making sexual
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.260]   comments about these girls.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.500]   And I got super offended.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.220]   Like, "How dare you?"
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.140]   And then I realized, "Man, we're the same age, looking the same girls,
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:41.180]   but our intent is really different, and that intent matters."
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.620]   And so notice here, he's not necessarily talking to the women in his
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:45.860]   illustration to make a change.
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.620]   This is in a talk where he was like, "All right, ladies,
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:50.940]   so everyone has to wear muumus and hoods, maybe a good idea."
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:51.860]   He doesn't do that.
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.700]   He puts it on the person who's looking and says, "Hey, you got to be honest
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.820]   with yourself about your intent."
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:00.700]   And look, I'm not trying to present myself as a super holy person.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.820]   Like I said, I ran into pornography, like many of you, at a very young age,
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.140]   before I was looking at it.
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:11.900]   And it had that weird effect of being really alluring because looking at naked
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:16.460]   women is fascinating to men, and you're meant to find it to be so.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:20.020]   But then seeing it divorced from relationship the way that it was also
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.300]   introduced a bunch of shame into my heart.
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.620]   And it just did that weird dance where like I'm drawn to it and repulsed by it,
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.700]   and I'm repulsed by me.
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:33.500]   And I dislike this proliferation of sexualized imagery because I see it rob
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.940]   people of their hearts so much.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.260]   And so I'm not mad at you if it's something you've struggled with.
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.940]   I'm mad at it because it's a distortion.
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.420]   Sex isn't the devil's game.
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.020]   The devil's game is distorted, and I don't like that.
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.860]   And I don't like the way it steals a lot of the vibrancy and creativity out of a lot
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.860]   of the young people I get to minister to.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.180]   And so I want to see it change.
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:56.660]   And what Jesus advocates is this practice of, man, if your eye causes you to sin,
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:00.220]   he says, your right eye, if it causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.460]   It's better for you to lose one of your members and your whole body be thrown
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:02.900]   to hell.
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.540]   If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away.
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.460]   For it's better for you to lose one of your members and your whole body to go
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:08.940]   into hell.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:13.300]   The practice, he says, is restraint can bring liberty.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.740]   Restraint can bring liberty.
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:19.620]   If what I see through my eyes is corrupting my imagination and corrupting
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:23.420]   my action, then I will change what I see with my eyes.
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:27.100]   Now, is he advocating mutilation?
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.940]   No.
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.900]   Although some people historically in Christianity have read it that way.
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.620]   Famously, Origen, the great theologian, read it that way.
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:38.460]   He understood hand as a euphemism for the male organ, so he cut his off.
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:41.660]   At the Council of Nicaea, they told everyone, "Stop it.
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.380]   Don't do that anymore.
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.340]   It's a bad call."
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:47.300]   And that was a good decision by our religious leadership.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:49.540]   Because I love the way John Piper said it.
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.260]   Jesus says, "Cut out your right eye."
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.140]   Is he being literal?
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.180]   No, because you could just lust with your left eye.
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.420]   And if you cut out both eyes, you can still lust in your heart.
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.300]   He just located the heart as the source of the problem in the earlier verse.
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.860]   And so he's being metaphoric here about the reality that, "Hey,
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:08.220]   we have to get a lot more radical with what we allow into our eyes to affect our
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.300]   imagination, to affect our actions.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:10.900]   Get radical."
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.540]   He's not talking about mutilation.
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.260]   He's talking about mortification.
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.860]   There's some things that need to die in my life.
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:21.060]   If there's some cues that always kickstart this craving, I'm eliminating the cue.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.820]   I'm getting it out of my life.
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:27.580]   Now, again, notice he says, "If," because you have to gauge you.
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:29.820]   If your eye calls you to sin, then cut it out.
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.620]   There may be some places and spaces that you go, "You know what?
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.940]   This is a place that when I get here, my eye has a lustful intent.
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:37.140]   I can't do this anymore."
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.420]   Others of you, it may not be an issue.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:42.820]   You have to be honest with you and how you deal with different challenges
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:43.460]   and frustrations.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:47.820]   I've got a friend that going to bars does not bother him.
[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:50.580]   He can have a drink with a friend, hang out, visit.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.980]   There's no temptation to get hammered and blackout.
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.220]   Like, it's not his problem.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:59.540]   But I have another friend that's a recovering alcoholic, and he just had
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.100]   to be honest.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.860]   He was like, "Dude, as soon as I walk into a bar," he's like, "the sights,
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:07.620]   the sounds, the smells," he said, "it just kickstarts this craving that's
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:08.620]   almost out of control."
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.180]   And he said, "I want to go hang with my friends there."
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.660]   And I just realized I just can't do it.
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:14.260]   Like, just for me, I can't go in there.
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.900]   And so, he had to mutilate himself socially.
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:23.340]   I'm going to cut off a part of me socially to protect my life.
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.620]   My other buddy can go there without a problem.
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.220]   But the buddy that can go there without a problem had a real issue
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.660]   with pornography.
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:33.580]   And so, he had to get pretty radical, getting a lot of screens out of his house,
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.020]   getting rid of computers in there, locking up his stuff with accountability
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.380]   software and friendships.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.460]   But then he realized, "Man, as I was locking up all my screens,
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.020]   I would go to bookstores sometime because I was so, like,
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.780]   hard up for a sexual image.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.980]   I would, like, be cruising this bookstore looking for books that might have
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.420]   something like that."
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.740]   And I realized, "Man, this is nuts.
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:50.500]   I got a problem.
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.780]   I just can't go to this bookstore anymore."
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.900]   And some of you have never thought that way about a bookstore.
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.820]   And I'm sort of sad for even putting it in your mind.
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:39:59.780]   But he had to be real.
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:06.300]   For him, bars, fine, but no bookstores.
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.500]   And you got to be honest with you.
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:12.020]   There's places where you go, "Hey, to be honest, all my friends are
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.220]   watching this show.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.260]   I can't watch that show.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.820]   Hey, I'm following these people online because all my friends do,
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.140]   but I've noticed every time I look at that person's Instagram,
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:23.340]   I get unhappy and sad and don't like my body or my life."
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:24.260]   Well, guess what?
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:28.980]   Cut your eye out or quit looking at their thing.
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:35.220]   Mortification, cut it off because that restriction actually brings liberty,
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.700]   which we know in theory anyway, right?
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.820]   I mean, all of us know that.
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:41.020]   We agree with it with food, right?
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:48.060]   How does Simone Biles fly through the air like a bird?
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:52.380]   It's because there's some team of trainers behind her meticulously counting
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.220]   out like every grain of salt.
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.420]   No, no, no, it's too much.
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:59.220]   And her sugar intake and food intake, she's had to put so much restriction
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:05.620]   to her diet to liberate her to do some superhuman activity in gymnastics.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:06.860]   And some of you are that way.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:11.620]   You restrict your diet so you can climb the highest mountain and swim the deepest
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.980]   river and all the stuff that you do.
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:18.140]   So we all know that we agree with this practice Jesus is advocating.
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.460]   Restriction just might bring liberty.
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.100]   And he looks sexually at us and says, "It's the same.
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.020]   I'm not trying to hurt you.
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:26.020]   I'm trying to help you.
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:27.780]   Trying to save your life.
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:31.820]   This unrestrained, boundaryless sexuality has cost us too much.
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.700]   It's cost us too much."
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:36.420]   He says, "I don't want you to pay that cost anymore.
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.300]   I want it to change."
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.620]   Now, let me close with this.
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:45.500]   You know, you hear this and I do think some of us should look at his command and say,
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.180]   "I got to make some changes and I got to be honest."
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.860]   You may be like me where, man, I just...I got rid of my TV at one point,
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.180]   which for some people sounded so insane.
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.580]   And I'm like, "Man, he said cut your eye out.
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:55.260]   Get rid of your TV."
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.260]   It's like, "Actually, fine.
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:00.100]   I, like, read a bunch of books."
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.980]   You may need to make some real changes.
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:06.220]   But look, if all you do is walk out of here and feel bad about yourself,
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.300]   this is not a good sermon.
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:14.340]   And if you make some changes, I hope you do, that's also not sufficient.
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.660]   See, we didn't read it, but the way he starts this sermon is not with,
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.620]   "I'm going to tell you guys how to get your crap together.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.260]   Write this down.
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.780]   Number one, cut your eyes out."
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:26.540]   You know, like he doesn't start with a list of rules to get you to maybe earn
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.340]   God's approval.
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.540]   Do you know where he starts the sermon?
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:35.700]   He says, "Blessed are the poor in spirit because theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:38.460]   What does poor in spirit mean?
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:41.420]   It means I have spiritual poverty.
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.580]   I'm not enough to earn the approval of God.
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:45.540]   I'm not.
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.860]   I've fallen short.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.500]   My hands are dirty.
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:49.660]   My eyes have seen things.
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:52.740]   My hands have done things.
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:56.660]   I have been depleted spiritually.
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:00.860]   And he says, "When you admit that, you're blessed."
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.380]   Blessed are those who mourn.
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:08.700]   He says, "When you realize how far you've gone from the standard, you mourn.
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:11.900]   You cry in the car like me."
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:16.220]   He says, "And when you do that, you're blessed because my comfort is
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.900]   coming for you."
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.740]   He said, "Blessed are those who are meek."
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:22.780]   That means I'm not proud.
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:23.780]   I'm not puffing out my chest.
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:24.660]   Well, this is a problem for me.
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:25.340]   I'm not dealing with this.
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:26.180]   He said, "No, no, no, no.
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:30.860]   It's the meek are the ones who will inherit the earth."
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.700]   He said, "I've come here to do something new.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.740]   I'm a king inaugurating a kingdom.
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:39.020]   And the entrance into my kingdom, the entrance into the blessing of God,
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:44.220]   the smile of God, the love of God that's inexhaustible," he says,
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:46.260]   "It doesn't come by getting your act together.
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:49.580]   It comes by admitting your need.
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:53.940]   I am poor and I feel sad about it.
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:55.900]   And I'm not proud.
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:58.420]   I need you.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.940]   I need the king to be what I'm not."
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:03.580]   And that's what Jesus loves to do.
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:08.900]   He loves to live the perfect life you couldn't.
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:11.620]   And then the Bible says, "The wages of sin is death."
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:13.820]   Death's the payment for sin.
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:14.700]   He never sinned.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:15.700]   He didn't need to die.
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:18.300]   So what he did on that cross is what David said earlier,
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:25.020]   "He who knew no sin became sin for you and for me."
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:29.540]   He said, "I know what you've done and I'm taking all of it and the shame of it,
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:36.020]   the sadness of it, every sticky, sad, isolating, lonely thing," he said,
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:42.660]   "I am driving it like a stake through my heart and I am burying it in the grave.
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:46.420]   And then I rise and I leave it behind.
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:50.100]   And you trust me and you rise.
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:54.900]   And yeah, I got a way for you to live that's good, but where does it start?"
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.300]   Jesus was asked, "What's the work of the Father?"
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.540]   And he said, "Believe in the one he sent."
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:05.100]   You come to Jesus, his arms are open wide, and I promise you,
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.220]   he wants to change you from the inside out.
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:12.300]   And then we can be what he says in the sermon, a city on the hill,
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:15.980]   shining out to a broken world to some answers, being again what the early
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:19.460]   church was, showing the world we don't have a regressive sexual ethic,
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:21.660]   we have a liberating sexual ethic.
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.900]   What you have is slavery.
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.140]   What we have is freedom.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.620]   And so if you're like, "Well, Ben, I don't know if any of this is realistic
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:28.460]   in the world today."
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:31.260]   We're not supposed to be like the world today.
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.620]   We're supposed to be like the kingdom today.
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:36.100]   And the world's a mess.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:41.180]   But when they see what the king is doing in us, ah, the porch will be a city
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.580]   on a hill.
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:45.500]   That's a pretty encouraging thought.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:48.660]   So, Father, we love you.
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:53.740]   We thank you that there's grace today in Jesus.
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:59.140]   We thank you that nobody has sinned beyond what your arms can reach.
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:03.580]   It's insulting to suggest that our sin is stronger than your sacrifice.
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:06.900]   So if anybody is tempted to feel that way, "Well, he doesn't know what I've done.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.300]   He doesn't know how far I've gone."
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.860]   I haven't, but I know how mighty Jesus is.
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.500]   And don't insult him by saying your sin is stronger than he is.
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.540]   He can forgive you.
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:22.820]   And it magnifies his grace to forgive you.
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:27.140]   So come to him because his arms are open wide.
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:28.660]   Admit, "I'm poor in spirit.
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:31.100]   I'm needy.
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:35.100]   I'm not happy about that, but I'm happy that I'm coming to you with that because
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:39.780]   you promised me those who mourn and are meek and are poor in spirit,
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:40.740]   they're blessed.
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:41.620]   They're blessed.
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:42.180]   They're blessed.
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:46.780]   And Lord Jesus, would you heal me, forgive me, bless me?"
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:54.020]   Anybody want that today, the grace of God today?
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.820]   I just want to encourage you right in your seat before we clear out of here and go
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:03.220]   wherever we're going to go, let that be a holy space with Jesus.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:08.060]   Let this be a moment that maybe you never forget as you deal honestly with him about
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:13.140]   what he was unafraid to speak of, the most intimate part of your life.
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.940]   And let him speak healing into it.
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.380]   Let him speak grace into it.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:22.740]   Let him speak life into it.
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:25.740]   We're yours, God, and we love you.
[00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.740]   We look to you.
