[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   [Music]
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Ports, how we doing?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   If we haven't met, my name is JP. It's a privilege to be with you.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   If you're tuning in from somewhere else, Fort Worth, Houston, anywhere around the world,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   El Paso, listening as you drive, man, we're so glad that you are with us,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   worshiping, diving into God's word with us this evening.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   And so, if we are friends on social media or anything like that, you know,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   last week was my son's birthday. So I have a son. He's six years old.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   His name is Weston. He just turned six years old last week.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   And we, last week was his birthday. And so we do birthdays big in our house.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Anybody else do that growing up? Birthdays big? Okay. Good. Like five of you.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   And so, he had a party. We went to Nickel Rama. Anybody been there?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Awesome. It's like an arcade here in Dallas, DFW.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And it's, you know, it's like a nickel basically is a quarter.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And we're cheap parents, so we went there.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And so, here's what that meant. Every day last week, he'd wake up,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   "Daddy, it's going to be my birthday." You know? "Daddy, I'm going to have a party."
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I'm like, "Dude, I know. I'm paying for the party."
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   He's like, "You know, the next day, Tuesday, it's my birthday.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   My birthday party's coming up." I'm like, "I know, buddy. I know.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Birthday party's coming up." And then Wednesday, "Hey, my birthday.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   My party's coming up. It's coming up." I'm like, "I know, man. I know."
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   He's like, "Let's go through the invite list again."
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I'm like, "Well, you got your cousins and our friends."
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And anyway, so just every--and then Thursday, "Hey, my party's coming up."
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   You know? And if I'm completely transparent with you,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   like this idea--he kept saying the same thing, "I can't wait for my party.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I can't wait for the party."
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   And he's really describing me, like 16 into my young adult years.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Like that's basically how I lived life, whatever was going on.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I can't wait for the party. Like that's who I was.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   It started in high school, you know?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   It was like whose parents are going to be out of town?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   We're going over there, right?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   We'll hang out at your place. And we would do pastor parties.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   That's pasture parties, not pastor parties. Those are different things.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Pastor parties. And so we'd go hang out in high school.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And then college came around, and it was phone parties,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   frat parties, sorority parties, who has the function.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And then we'd get the fake IDs, we'd go to the club and the bar.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And it was just like living for the weekend.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   In college, you stretch out the weekend.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   It starts on Thursday night. That was college night.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   That's where the drink specials for the college kids were.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   So we'd go Thursday, Friday, Saturday, right?
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And then I graduated from college, moved to Dallas,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   and it was just more of this, "I can't wait for the party."
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And I would sit at my desk Monday just thinking,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   "Can't wait for Friday to get here."
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And we'd start with the happy hour.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And then the happy hour, it will turn into evening.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   And then we'll go to this bar. It's kind of pregame.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And then we'll go to this club.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   There's a club on Lower Greenville here in Dallas,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   like the bar scene. It was the Beagle. It's not there anymore.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And it's just where my heart was.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I moved five times all within one mile of Lower Greenville.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And specifically, that place, my friend's sister was a bartender there,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   so I had this VIP card, which meant you didn't have to wait
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   in all the long lines with those losers.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   You could go around the side door, you know?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And you didn't have to pay a cover, and the guy would wave you in,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   and you'd go in like a baller, and you'd have this booth.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And it was just like that. We loved that place.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   It was our country club, if you will.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   You get the bottle service there, the setup there.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And I wasn't a believer, like we don't know each other.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Like I wasn't walking with Christ at this time.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   But I remember the thrill of just thinking,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   "Man, I don't know what's going to happen."
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And I look forward to the weekend, and it's like,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   "Hey, we get some drinks in us.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   "You're dancing on the dance floor.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   "Everybody's hot and sweaty.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   "You're dancing with some girl that you don't know,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   "and even that's kind of fun and exciting.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   "You don't know where it's going to go.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   "She may go home with me. I may go home with her.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   "I don't know. My friends may get in a fight.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   "I might get in a fight."
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I just did that thrill of like, "Man, I just don't know.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   "I'm just carefree. I'm young, wild, and free."
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   It's funny because we went back down there,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   my family and I, we were eating down in Lower Greenville
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   two weeks ago, and just driving through the parking lot,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   and I'm like, "Oh, yeah, I remember that.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   "We got in a fight there one night."
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   No, that's where I was with my wife,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   and I was like, "Oh, that's where some girl
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   "tried to pay your brother to take him home."
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And, "Oh, and that's where Travis got so drunk
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   "he jumped up on top of a Porsche.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   "That was not a good night."
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And just like reliving these memories.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   It was just flooding back to me
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   from a time when I couldn't wait for the party.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And I'm not here to tell you like, "Hey, I'm a pastor now."
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And I look back and it wasn't fun at all.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   It was so much fun.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   It was so much fun.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   You know?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Like I imagine heroin is so much fun.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I mean, it'll kill you.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   But it's so much fun. It's gotta be right.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   People give their life to it.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And so I'm not here to tell you it wasn't fun.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I'm here to tell you maybe it was too much fun.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Maybe it was something like that whole idea
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   of I can't wait for the party.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Like what if I look back on those years
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   and constantly showing up Monday at work
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   and I can't wait for the party.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   See, my whole life was passing me by.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   I wasn't living in the moment.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   I was just looking forward to the next party.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   The next thrill.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   The next excuse to do something stupid.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   What if my whole life was passing me by?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And so we're in Lyrics and Lies, this new series.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   David kicked us off last week talking about you're perfect,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   just the way that you are.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   And how that music's selling you that lie.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And the scripture tells you something different.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And tonight, the lie of the music
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   that we grew up listening to
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   is that life is found in the party.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   It's the whole like drug, sex, and rock and roll, if you will.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Or drug, sex, and rock star status.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   And so I've got some songs I want to play for you.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   So that's how I was, right?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   You know, Monday, it's the freaking weekend.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I'm about to have me some fun.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And that's why we go there, right?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   It's like I'm sipping on Coke and rum.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   So I'm like, so what? I'm drunk.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Right? I got an excuse now to do everything.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Like some of you, you know what I'm talking about, right?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And some of you, you're like, no, we can't do that.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   We're in church. Don't even, what are we doing?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And I know you're so uncomfortable.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And praise God for you.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And so the lie, the lie is that life is in the party, right?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And so the Bible gives us this social experiment
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   with this guy that basically,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   the reason that the Lord preserved this ancient text
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   in Ecclesiastes is there was a man who had everything.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Like he was complete and total rock star status.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   He had everything that you think you wanted on steroids.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Times a hundred.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   And this is King Solomon.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And so it's really Ecclesiastes,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   this one big social experiment where he's just basically saying,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   hey, I tried this to see if there was life there.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Then I tried this to see if there was life there.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And I tried this to see if there was life there.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   And I think that in the back of our minds, we all think,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   hey, if we had what Fittie had, right?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   This is the lie.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Like, hey, I want to party like a rock star.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   This is what he's telling.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   He still, Post Malone's still selling it, right?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Rock star, right?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I'm popping pillies, you know?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   [laughter]
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Party like a rock star.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   I mean, you guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   It's still the message, right?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And the truth is, if you can't wait for the party,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   if you're living for the party,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   it's going to leave you despairing.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   It's going to leave you empty.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   It's going to leave you depressed.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   There's nobody that has continued to chase the party
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   and found satisfaction.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   It hasn't happened.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   In fact, there's this one researcher from Sydney
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   who studied 12,000, rather, 12,665 popular musicians,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   rock stars, rappers, if you will,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   to see if their lifestyle actually shortened their life.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Because that was the popular belief,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   does it actually shorten their life?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   She studied 12,665 of them.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   This is what she found.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   The average lifespan of a rock star was shortened
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   by 25 years than the general public.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   The suicide rate among musicians that she studied
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   compared to the general population
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   was up to seven times higher,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   700% more likely to commit suicide.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   The homicide rates among musicians
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   are eight times higher than that
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   among the general U.S. population.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And so I want to look at how life is not found
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   in sex, drugs, or the rock star status.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   We're looking at King Solomon.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Post Malone actually wrote "Rock Star" about King Solomon.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   That was about him.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   No, I'm lying about that.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   That's not true.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   He had enough sex to make Hugh Hefner blush, this guy.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   He drank enough wine.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   In fact, he owned the distillery.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   He owned the vineyard.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   He owned the brewery.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   That's this guy.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   He wasn't just taking shots of Patron.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   He owned Patron, this guy.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   He had rock star status like Mick Jagger.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   He's the original Kanye, Solomon.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   He's the O.G. Kanye.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   That's who we're reading about right here.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   And he says this.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   "I said to myself," Ecclesiastes 2, verse one,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   "I said to myself, 'Come now, I will test you
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   "with pleasure to find out what is good.'
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   "But that also proved to be meaningless.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   "Laughter, I said, is madness,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   "and what does pleasure accomplish?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   "I tried cheering myself with wine and embracing folly."
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And so my first point this evening
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   is that life is not found in sex.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   He talks about pleasure.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Life is not found in sex.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Fittie says, "I'm into having sex.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   "I'm into making love, so come give me a hug
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   "if you're into getting rugged."
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Ludacris, maybe you heard of him.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   He says, "I want to lick you from your head to your toes,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   "and I want to move from the bed down to the floor."
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   I think he means floor.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   (congregation laughs)
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Then I want to, yeah, I can't even read that.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   I'm just gonna stop.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   But he wants to know your fantasy.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   He wants to know your fantasy.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Solomon said, "Come now, and I will test you
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   "with pleasure to find out what is good.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   "But that proved to be meaningless."
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And so the problem with this, right,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   is experiencing pleasure will only leave you
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   wanting more pleasure.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Is that not true?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Doesn't it just ratchet up a little bit every time?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Like, you know this.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Experientially, you know this.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Nobody's ever experienced something pleasurable
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   and like, "Okay, I'm done.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   "I don't need that for the rest of my life."
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   We'll just go tame, like you get a massage maybe.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Like you get a massage, and it's a great massage,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   and you're done, and you're like, "Okay, that's it.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   "I never need another massage for the rest of my life."
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Like, that was it, that was the best.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   No, a week later, you're like, "Dude, I gotta go back
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   "and get another one," because it just ratchets up.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   It just leaves you wanting more.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Pornography does the same thing.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   I say it all the time, it's the lie of one last time.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   You just fed something, and it grew,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   and now it's bigger, and it's gonna devour you.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   The club does the same thing.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   You love the thrill, the excitement, the fun of,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   "Hey, I don't know what's gonna happen,"
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   and it just leaves you wanting more for the next week,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   and next week, and you have to keep going bigger and better,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   and pretty soon, it's like, "Hey, these clubs here
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   "in Houston or in Dallas or around,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   "we need to go to Vegas."
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Because what happens in Vegas
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   will haunt you the rest of your life, that's the truth.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   And I want you to know, I say it all the time,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   that sex is good, sex is from God.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   God invented it.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   He made it feel the way it does.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   God inserted pleasure into his invention,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   his creation of sex.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   He did that.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   He put the nerve endings where they are.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   That was God's genius idea, but you need to know
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   it will not satisfy you.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   It is not ultimate, and I know you're thinking,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   "Well, that's easy for you to say.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   "You're gonna go home to your wife."
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   The reality is, if someone in marriage
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   experiences intimacy often, like really, really often,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   that's .625% of their life in marriage.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   So of 100 hours, that's what they're doing
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   for a half an hour, right?
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   So there's gotta be more to marriage than that.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Nobody's doing more.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   If that's where meaning was,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   then who would have the best marriage?
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Like porn stars would have the best marriage.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   We'd be looking at them and say,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   "Hey, we need to follow their lead.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   "They really got this marriage thing down."
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   But that's not the way that it works,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   because there's something so much more
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   to God's gift of marriage than sex,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   or intimacy through sex.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   I can prove it to you, because Solomon,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   he has a harem.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   What a harem is, is a group of women to choose from.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   This is where it gets really weird with this guy.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   But I think this is why Creator God preserved this text.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   See, he has 700 wives.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   He's a polygamist.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   And he has 300 prostitutes.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   They all live with him, and they're all at his disposal.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Here's what that means, is he can sleep with a wife
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   two times a day for a year
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   without sleeping with the same person.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   And then when he gets bored with wives,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   if he wants to go outside of marriage,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   he has 300 prostitutes at his disposal.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   He's not going to www.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   He's not pulling up on his iPhone.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   He has the live-in pornography
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   in three-dimensional image right there in front of him.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   It's crazy.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   And you think, "Man, but was he a Christian?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   "Christ didn't come."
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Yeah, that's complicated, but here's the deal.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   He didn't know God.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   This was his downfall.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   I believe this is why God shows us this,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   because this is what ruined Solomon.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   This is what led his heart astray.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   He was not obedient to God in the wives that he took,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   even that he had more than one.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   So do you know, like I think we think,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   "Man, if I just had everything I wanted, I'd be happy."
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   You know anybody that gets everything they want?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   They're dysfunctional.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Usually they move toward a place of mental illness.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   They can't deal with society.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   They isolate themselves in deep, deep, deep sadness,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   but we don't learn that lesson, do we?
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Because you came in this room thinking,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   "If I just had everything I wanted, I would be happy."
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Solomon wanted it, he did it, and he said it was meaningless.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   And we can learn something here, that it's empty.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   When we're constantly looking for the next time
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   that we can experience pleasure to fulfill us,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   we become literally ill,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   and we start chasing weird pleasures.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   And that's why we listen and laugh at things like ludicrous,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   asking us, "What's our fantasy?"
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   We're 6'9" right now on the radio.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   And let me tell you what's going to happen,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   because I see it all the time, and I love you.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   I love being here with you guys.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   I'm looking at you, I'm looking in your eyes,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   and I love that God has you here this evening.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   But here's the way this plays out, and I'll just tell you,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   because I get to see hundreds and hundreds
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   and hundreds of relationships.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Dude looks at porn, he grows an appetite
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   that's not just unholy, it's unhealthy.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   It's not that he wants sex, he wants the craziest kind of sex.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   So he gets in a relationship with a woman,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   he convinces her that he's good husband material.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   They get married, he has expectations of her
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   that she will never be able to meet.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   That in fact monogamy will never satisfy him,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   because he's been training himself for variety
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   since the fifth grade.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   And he's been able to dial up anything he wanted
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   just by putting in a web address or a search engine request.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   And those expectations of that woman
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   are going to crush her, and women,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   you guys can be complicated beings
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   in the way that you think, and you know, guys are simple.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Like we're just kind of, I'll just say first person,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   I'm just kind of dumb, right, like just one A to B,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   like just simple minded, but you guys,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   if something hurts you emotionally, right,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   you're not into it anymore.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   And then that guy begins to abuse you,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   but he doesn't even know that he is.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   He begins to manipulate you with his words,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   and you begin to endure some verbal abuse,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   but he doesn't even know that's happening.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   He's just following what he's fed his heart
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   since the fifth grade.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   And I see it all the time.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   And I picked on the guys, but girls,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   you do the same thing.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   So many of you are addicted to pornography.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   You've been feeding your heart unnatural desires.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   It's been growing inside of you.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   And so what happens is girls tend to give sex to get love,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   and guys give love to get sex,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   and it's a really bad exchange
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   because the love that you're offering, it's counterfeit.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   It's not real.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   You're like Fiddy.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   He's into having sex.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   He ain't into making love.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   He doesn't even know what love is, guys.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   He'll never experience love.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   He's going to die having never experienced love,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   and that's a really, really, really sad thing.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   And you know what we do?
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   We let him teach us.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   We bob our heads to it.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   We let him be our instructor,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   feeding us lies.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Solomon says laughter is madness,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   and what does pleasure accomplish?
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   And then he says this, "I tried cheering myself with wine."
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Right?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   So now he's moving on to this idea of,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   "Hey, how can I experience pleasure?"
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Like he's talking about laughter.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   I like laughter.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   I like funny people.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Like if you're funny, let's hang out.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Let's be friends, okay?
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Call me up afterwards.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Like I love to hang out with people that make me laugh,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   but when laughter becomes ultimate to you,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   when that joy, your emotions become ultimate to you,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   one, that's a sign of immaturity,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   but when you're chasing the next time
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   that you can experience happiness through laughter,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   what you do is you begin to supplement it.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   You want to feel good,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   and so you get high, you smoke something,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   you snort something, you pop something,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   or you drink something,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   and then that becomes a normal part of your life.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   And so my second point is,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   life is not found in the next high.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Life is not found in the next high.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   If it is, he says,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   "You can find me in the club, Bottle Full of Bub.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   "Look, Mommy, I got the X if you into taking drugs."
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   LMFAO says, "Party Rock is in the house tonight.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   "Woo.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   "Everybody just have a good time.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   "Yeah.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   "And we're gonna make you lose your mind.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   "Everybody just have a good time.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   "One more shot for us, another round.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   "Fill up my cup.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   "We don't mess around."
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   I tried cheering myself with wine.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Can I tell you something?
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   I like a nice glass of wine.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   True story.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Sometimes, not very often,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   every now and then, in fact, this past weekend,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   my friend had a birthday party,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   and we went over, it was a dinner,
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   and they had an expensive bottle of wine
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   in the middle of the table.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   I didn't pay for it.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   I don't pay for it.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   But he did.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   And so I had a glass.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   And can I tell you something?
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   I think it was God-honoring.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Like communion.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Like fellowshipping with other believers.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Celebrating someone's birth.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Having a glass of wine.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I don't have any problem with you having a glass of wine,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   as long as you know what the Scripture says about it.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   I don't think it's a sin.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   That's not my message.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   That's not what I'm here to tell you.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   But you having three glasses of wine might be a sin.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   You needing a glass of wine might be a sin.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   You ever done that?
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   You come home, like, "Oh, rough day.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   "I need a glass of wine."
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Oh, you need one?
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Really?
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Oh, you want to use it?
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Oh, you want to alter the way that you feel?
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   You want to use that to alter the way that you feel?
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   That might be a sin.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   That could be problematic.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Let's talk about that for a minute, right?
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   And so some of us, we move to this place
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   where we don't even realize.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   And then people would say,
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   "Well, alcohol's not really a big deal for me."
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Really?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Then stop.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   "Oh, drinking's not a big deal for me."
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Oh, it's not a big deal for you?
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   Great.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Never do it again.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Because if that's hard, then let's agree.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   It's a big deal for you.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   That matters.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   When something's not a big deal for you,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   you can just say, "Oh, I don't need to do that anymore."
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Right?
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   "I'm done with that."
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   And so I think the why is really important.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   And if you drink for a feeling,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   like if you don't want to go somewhere
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   because there's not an open bar there,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   or you want to go there because there is an open bar there.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Like, "Hey, you want to go to this wedding?"
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   "I don't know."
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   "Is there alcohol?"
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   And all of a sudden you're like,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   "No, I don't really want to go."
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Like, you might have a problem.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Okay?
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   You may need to consider that.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Like, that is something, an act of worship for you.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And so here's four things that I think are really helpful
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   directly from the scripture that you can drink if.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   And so you can write this down.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   You can drink as long as no one is offended by it.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   It's 1 Corinthians chapter 8.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   As long as it doesn't cause anyone to stumble.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   It's Romans 14.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   And so that just means like if somebody's there
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   and they're going to get drunk
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   or be more inclined to get drunk because you're there,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   then you don't do it.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   If someone's there and they'd be offended by you drinking,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   then don't do it.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Don't even consider it.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   As long as you don't get drunk, that's Ephesians 5:18.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And as long as you do it for the glory of God.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Again, if you're sitting there, that's 1 Corinthians 10:31.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Whether you eat or drink, whatever you do,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   do it to the glory of God.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   If you can do it to the glory of God, then praise Him.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   But if you can't, don't.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Then don't.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Don't do it.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And I'm just going to tell you that you going out there
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   to drink so that you can do something
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   that you wouldn't be courageous enough to do sober,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   that's not you doing it to the glory of God.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   That's problematic.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Stop it.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   It's not God honoring, right?
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Can I tell you something?
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   It's not an excuse.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   I was drunk is not a good excuse for anything.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Like I don't know when that became okay.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Like all of a sudden your boyfriend cheated on you,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   but it's okay because he was drunk.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   What?
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Are you serious?
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Like is that what you're going to tell God?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Like God's going to look at you in the face and say,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   "Hey, why didn't you follow me down there?"
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   "Oh, man, I was drunk."
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Blame it on the alcohol.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   No, no.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   No, that's not going to go well for you.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   That's not going to go well for you.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   It's not an excuse.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And so let's be honest.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   So many of you get drunk so that you have an excuse
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   to do things you don't have enough courage to do
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   when you're sober.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Let's learn from Solomon for a minute.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   This dude partied, okay?
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Like he partied more than any of you partied.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   That's the truth.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   He would have 15,000 people over for dinner every night.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   One of his parties he invited,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   this is straight from the Scriptures, 1 Kings 4.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   He invites everyone in the kingdom over.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   What he had for dinner that night,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   he served 22,000 cows.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Not 22,000 filets, 22,000 cows.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   This is true, literal story.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Like this actually happened.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   I can't even get my head around that.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   And you say, "Well, why does that matter?
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   "Why would we know?"
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Just so that God is showing you,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   "Hey, you never partied like this guy."
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And he's telling you it was meaningless.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   It is meaningless.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   And you say, "No, man, you don't understand.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   "We party big, JP, okay?
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   "I was the president of my fraternity,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   "and one time we got this keg."
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   And Solomon's laughing at you.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   He makes your party, your little foam soiree,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   look like my six-year-old's birthday party, okay?
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   And there was no keg there, right?
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   It was like community and family and friends.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   And that's what he makes your party look like.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And he's saying, "Hey, it was meaningless.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   "There wasn't life there.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   "It's going to leave you empty."
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   And so you drink to try to escape reality,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   but the problem with that is reality
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   is still there when you're done.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   And the problem with that, friends,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   is you never learn to deal with reality.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Like, so, okay, he broke your heart.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Now you gotta go get wasted.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Really?
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   What if you learn to deal with a broken heart?
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Because life is hard.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   And you know what people who get wasted
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   to deal with broken hearts do?
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   They grow up to be moms who get wasted
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   to deal with broken hearts or hard days
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   or rough days at school
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   or when the kids aren't listening.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   That's what happens.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   That's where it ends up.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Oh, nobody grew up and said,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   "Hey, I really want to be an alcoholic when I grow up."
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   But so many people do.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Why?
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Because they dealt with the breakup
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   with a glass of wine.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Two, three, four.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Oh, you didn't think about that, did you?
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Oh, you didn't know that's where that goes.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   That's where that goes.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   That's where it leads to.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Ephesians 5:18 says, "Do not get drunk on wine,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   "which leads to debauchery.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   "Instead, be filled with the Spirit."
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   What if you took that breakup
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   and you leaned into God
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   and you said, "God, my heart's so bad right now.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   "I don't think I'm gonna be able to sleep tonight.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   "I'm not gonna want to get out of bed tomorrow.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   "I hurt so bad.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   "In fact, I'm tempted to go get high.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   "I'm tempted to go get drunk.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   "I'm tempted to go hang out with my friends
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   "and do something stupid.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   "God, Holy Spirit, would you help me?"
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   What if you did that?
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   What does it mean to be filled with the Spirit in context?
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   It's like, what does alcohol do?
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   It removes your worries.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   It numbs you to life.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   What does the Holy Spirit do?
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   When you trust Him, He removes your worries
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   and He leads you to life.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   I don't know if you guys have seen,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   like this has always played out in movies,
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   but like Limitless is one,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   there's a show and a movie,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   but it's like this super drug
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   that at first you think there's no consequences to it.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   And what I'm trying to tell you
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   is there's always a consequence.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   There's always a hangover.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Life's always waiting for you.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   Like, right, you pop X because you want to feel good.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   You do Molly because you want to feel good
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   and you don't realize it's draining your brain of serotonin
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   and then your brain's not producing enough serotonin
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   and it's leaving you depressed
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   or putting holes in your brain, right?
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   I mean, you like Coke, right?
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   People give their entire lives to Coke.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   And I've sat with people right up here
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   trying to tell me, "No, but THC, it doesn't have drawbacks."
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   And I would just say, "You're a fool.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   "You're a fool.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   "Show me the last person that getting high
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   "made them a better follower of Jesus Christ."
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Like, "I'd love to meet you.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   "If that's you, I'll be up here afterwards.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   "We can chat."
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   He says, "I undertook," verse four,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   "I undertook great projects.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   "I built houses for myself and planted vineyards."
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Okay, when he says he built houses for himself,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   like this dude, okay?
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Like, here's a picture of his house, okay?
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   This is, like, every house that has ever been on MTV Cribs
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   could fit in that house, all right?
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   That is Solomon's Palace.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   It took 13 years to build it, and you're like,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   "Well, that's just 'cause it was a long time ago."
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   No, no, no, it took seven years to build God's house,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   the temple, which was extremely extravagant.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   13 years to build Solomon's Palace.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   When he says he built houses, like, it's next level.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   "I made gardens and parks and planted
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   "all kinds of trees in them," okay?
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   He's, like, saying, "I got 12-car garage, but only six cars."
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   "I made reservoirs to water groves and flourishing trees."
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Okay, he made reservoirs.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Can I tell you something?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Like, we got a picture of the reservoirs?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   You know what's crazy about that picture?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   That's taken a day.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   You know what's crazy about this text?
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   It was 3,000 years ago.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   His pools are still there.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   It's stamped geographically.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   This man actually lived.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   You can go to secular websites,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   search "the richest man to ever live,"
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   and secular websites, which deny the Bible,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   will tell you it's King Solomon
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   because his pools are still there.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   You could go to Bethlehem, travel about five miles northeast.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   You're going to see the pools of Solomon's.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   What did he use them for?
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   To water his vineyards, right?
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   He had vineyards, gardens, like the arboretum,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   like the daddy to the arboretum, right?
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   I know you got a succulent you're trying to keep alive.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Dude had vineyards.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Vineyards, this guy.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   "I bought male and female slaves
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   "and had other slaves who were born in my house.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   "I also owned more herds and flocks
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   "than anyone in Jerusalem before me.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   "I amassed silver and gold for myself
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   "and the treasure of kings and provinces.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   "I acquired male and female singers
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   "and a harem as well, the delights of a man's heart.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   "I'm looking for satisfaction everywhere,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   "and I'm coming up empty."
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   He's the ultimate rock star.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Third point, life is not found in rock star status.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   I know Fittie says, "The party like a rock star."
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   We talked about what Post Malone says.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Let me tell you, there's this club called the 27 Club.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Anyone heard of it?
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   It's a very exclusive club.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   It's a very famous club,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   but it's not a club that anyone wants to be a member of.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   It is a list of rappers and rock stars
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   who have died at the age of 27.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   There's a crazy amount of them.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Mac Miller just missed it by one year at 26.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Who's on the list?
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Amy Winehouse, Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   all died at the age of 27.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Why?
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Because they partied like rock stars.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   They did what you think you want to do,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   and it killed them.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Do you see why a loving father would sit up here and say,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   "I want something better for you."
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   I know that that's fun.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   I know it's fun.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   It's Satan's fun.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   It's the enemy's fun.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   You're going to get hooked to that kind of fun,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   and you're not going to be able to enjoy normal life.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   You're not going to be able to sit and be content
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   at your desk on Monday
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   because you're going to be looking forward to the party,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   and you're going to be dysfunctional,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   and you're going to be depressed,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   and you're going to have to take something
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   to feed your brain,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   to stabilize the serotonin
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   because you're constantly looking for the next party.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And God's saying, "Hey, I don't want that for you.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   "I want something better for you."
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   We all think that if we just had, you know, fill in the blank,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   that we would be happy,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   and none of us are ever going to have more stuff than Solomon,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   and yet he says, "No, it doesn't lead to happiness."
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   He had the nice house, the vineyards, the gardens.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   He has 30,000 employees, 30,000 people that work for him,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   and he's not a company.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   That's like the amount of employees Tesla has,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   but he's a person, and they work for him.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   He has herds and flocks.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   He has herds and flocks.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Like, you've got a little Yorkie or a Golden Doodle.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Like, that's cute.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   He's got herds and flocks, this guy, right?
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   And he's got singers.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   That's the--you know, that's this time's equivalent to the iTunes.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   So you've got, like, 7,000 songs on your iTunes.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Like, you've got the new Ariana Grande album.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Like, that's cute.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Like, he's got Ariana Grande hanging upside down in his living room,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   like, singing to him.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Like, that's this man.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   He has access to the actual singers.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   He has gold and silver.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Verse 8, "His income is a billion dollars a year."
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Not his net worth.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   His income, a billion dollars a year.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   That's $2,000 a minute.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   That's $2,700,000 per day he makes.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   $2 million a day this man makes,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   and he says, "It's meaningless.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   It's empty."
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   And maybe you don't want to listen to Solomon.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Let me give you some other people to listen to.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   You could listen to Brad Pitt.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   He said to Rolling Stone, he said,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   "Man, I know all these things are supposed to seem important to us--
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   the car, the condo, our version of success.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   But if that's the case, why is the general feeling out there
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   reflecting more impotence and isolation and desperation and loneliness?
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   If you ask me, I say, 'Toss all this.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   We've got to find something else.'"
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   I don't have those answers yet.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   The emphasis now is on success and personal gain.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   I'm sitting in it, and I'm telling you that's not it.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   I'm the guy who's got everything I know,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   but I'm telling you once you've got everything,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   then you're just left with yourself.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   I've said it before, and I'll say it again.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   It doesn't help you sleep any better,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   and you're not any better when you wake up because of it.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   This is Brad Pitt, says Tom Brady, 2009, in a 60-minute interview.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   He has five Super Bowl rings, four-time Super Bowl MVP.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   He's married to a Victoria's Secret model,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   and he says, "There's got to be something more.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   This isn't it. This isn't where life is found.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   There's got to be something else."
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   Russell Brand said, "You can't make yourself happy
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   with the acquisition of material objects
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   or even through romance or anything."
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Jim Carrey said, "Everybody should get rich and famous
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   and do everything they ever dreamed of
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   so that they can see that it's not the answer."
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   See, those people, they're infinitely better off than you are,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   not because of what they have,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   but because they know it won't bring happiness.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   We still sit in a place where we don't have it,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   and we think we're going to work hard tomorrow for it,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   and we can't wait for the party this weekend.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   They're saying, "Hey, man, that's not it. That's not it."
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   There was a club on Lower Greenville called the Sugar Shack.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Anybody remember the Sugar Shack?
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   No. Good.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   And so it was there. It was kind of the hot spot.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   And this one particular night, you know, it's full,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   like, pass-fire code. Everybody's in there.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   There's a DJ in there.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Everybody's drinking, dancing, jumping up and down,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   jamming to the DJ.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   And what happened is the floor fell out.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   It caved in. People got hurt, like, fell from the second floor.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   And it was kind of when God was doing a work in my heart,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   and it ministered to me, because I thought, you know,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   that's what we're doing is we're, like, partying, we're dancing,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   we're numbing ourselves, we're listening to songs.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   We're not even understanding what the words that were feeding our heart
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   are actually saying.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   And it's like the door, the trap door is just going to fall out.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Like, we're going to dance all the way off the cliff.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   We're going to party all the way to hell.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   And God's going to be like, why'd you do that?
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   I don't know, God, I was drunk.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   I was, why didn't you pursue me?
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   It was fun.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   So life's not found in sex.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   Life's not found in the next high.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Life's not found in being a rock star.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   It's crazy because my story is I was at the Beagle 17 years ago.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   I was there.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   I was upstairs in this club, the one where I had the VIP car to,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   and I bumped into a friend from college.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   And I said, what are you doing this weekend?
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   And she said, I'm going to go check out this church.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   I said, great, pick me up.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   She did.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   And I went in and I sat in the back row.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   And I just began to wrestle with, all right, I've always said I believed in God.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   But the truth is I've always done what I wanted to do.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   I slept with whoever I wanted to sleep with.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   I drank whatever I wanted to drink.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   I snorted whatever I wanted to snort.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   I smoked whatever I wanted to smoke.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   I've never worshipped this God.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   I've always called myself a Christian.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   But I had to come to this place where I realized you're not a Christian.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   You can say you're a Christian, but you're not a Christian.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   You're not doing anything Christian.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   You're just saying you're a Christian.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   And I said, all right, well, who is God?
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   And I began to wrestle with it.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   I began to research it.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Is it the Hindu God, the Buddhist God, the Jewish God, the Islamic God?
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   I kept tripping over the character of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   And the beautiful news of the gospel that I don't have to pay for my sins because
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Jesus paid for my sins on the cross.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   And that he died for my sins and that God raised him from the grave.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   What Solomon is trying to tell you, friends, something really important,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   nothing in this life is going--nothing in this world is going to satisfy you.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   And if nothing in this world is going to satisfy you, he says specifically,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   nothing under the sun.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   If nothing under the sun is going to satisfy you, you have to go beyond the sun.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   There has to be something else out there.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   And can I tell you, you've got to hear me on this.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   You've got to hear me.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Wherever you're at, you've got to hear me on this.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   It is time right now, today, tonight, for you to begin to pursue God with
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   reckless abandonment.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   He is the only thing.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   It says in Ecclesiastes 3, God has set eternity in our heart.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   You have a void, an eternal hole in your heart that only God can fill.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   And if you chase the things of this world, you're going to end up empty.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   You're going to end up empty.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   He said, verse 24, "A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   find satisfaction in their own toil.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   This, too, I see is meaningless," or "This, too, I see is from the hand of God,"
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   rather.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   "This, too, I see is from the hand of God.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   For without him, who can eat and find enjoyment?
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   But to the sinner, he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   it over to the one who pleases God.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   This, too, is meaningless, a chasing after the wind."
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   He's saying, "Hey, Fiddy can gather all my stuff, and Cardi B, and Nicki Minaj,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   and 6ix9ine.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   They can gather up all my stuff.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   And you know what's going to happen?
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   They're just going to hand it to the righteous, those that are going to be with
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   me in my kingdom forever and ever and ever.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   They can collect it here in their little 76 years or 27 years, whatever they have.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   26 years for some.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   They're going to collect it, and then they're just going to hand it to my
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   children to enjoy with me forever.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   See, I told you tonight that the lie is that life is in the party.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   But the truth is that life is in the party.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   And you know, the only party I know of that's bigger than the ones that Solomon
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   went through is the one that is going to happen with Jesus in his presence.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   It's a party.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   This is the metaphor that we see in the scripture.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   It's a party.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   In Isaiah 25, it says there's going to be drinking and feasting.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   The best wine you've ever had.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   It says vintage.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Can you imagine vintage with God?
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   Like this is next-level vintage.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   But it's from the Bible.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   And it says there's music and dancing there, Luke 15.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   It says there's passion there, worship, Revelation 14.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   There's lots of people, but like it's friendships without flakiness or hurts.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   It's just like true love.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   Like you see them across the room on the dance floor, and it's not weird.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Like, hey, he hit on my man or anything like that.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   It's like, oh, like how are you doing?
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Like I missed you.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   And it's a reunion, like one you've never seen.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   This is for Thessalonians 4.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   Like your grandma, your grandpa, your great-grandparents, the ones that have
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   gone before you, your parents, siblings, like you're all there together, the
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   family of God.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   And it's this party, this forever kind of party, pure, unadulterated joy, a joy
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   you've never experienced candidly, the purest kind of joy, like the most free
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   anyone could be, no shame, no hurt, no sadness.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   It's a party.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Live for that party.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   Like you go to bed tonight, you wake up tomorrow, you say, I can't wait for that
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   party.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   How can I live for that party?
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   And it starts today.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   You don't have to wait to be there, to live, you know, filled with the Spirit,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   holding this world loosely, knowing you're going to be with God forever, that
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   that's all that matters.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   What else is going to matter 100 years from now?
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   How many shots you took, if you had sex or not, who you had sex with, what you
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   did, how much fun you had.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   100 years from now, what's going to matter?
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   You know?
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Live for that party.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   And Father, would you help us do that?
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   It's so easy to get trapped by the worries of this world.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   You know that.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   You tell us not to.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   And Father, you're such a good God to us.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   You're such a good dad to us.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   It says in your word that you desire to give good gifts to your children.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Father, would you give those good gifts tonight?
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   I pray that you would show us that we've been worldly tonight, that you would
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   convict us of sin tonight, that you would show us where life is found.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   Jesus, your son, he came -- said he came that we might have life and have it to
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   the fullest.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Would you help us to experience the fullest life that we could have in him?
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Father, would you show us that now as we sing to you?
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Would you stir our hearts' affections for you, God?
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.320]   It's in Jesus' name, amen.
