1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:13,400
 - Hey, hey, Porch, how we doing?

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,920
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,600
 Yeah, it is great to be with you.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,040
 I love my Porch friends, especially in the summer.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,060
 Hello, friends that are watching online.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,480
 We are in the middle of a series,

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,300
 or maybe towards the end of a series called The Remnant,

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,140
 and we've been talking about things that are true.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,240
 My name is Todd, by the way.

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,340
 I'm one of the guys that hangs out here at Watermark,

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,300
 and we're glad you're with us.

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,980
 But this series, The Remnant,

14
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,620
 we've been talking about what is left.

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,920
 The remnant is a word that comes from a French word

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,420
 from the 1500s that just basically means the remainder.

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,140
 All right, it's just exactly what it says.

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,260
 The remenoir is the word,

19
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,220
 and it means kind of what was left of a curtain.

20
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,060
 When you cut a curtain out of a big piece of cloth,

21
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,500
 what was left, the French said,

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,180
 is this is the remaining piece,

23
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,340
 the little remnant.

24
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,220
 It means what is left over.

25
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,760
 What remains is how it came into English.

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,040
 And so we've been talking about what should remain

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,480
 and what should be true of those

28
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,160
 who are gonna be faithful to the end.

29
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,920
 We've been having a blast talking about

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,120
 the marks of the remnant.

31
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,600
 Tonight I'm gonna give you four things, very simple.

32
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,940
 And that is this, simply this.

33
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,740
 The remnant sees what others do not see.

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,640
 And the remnant shines when others are not shining.

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,440
 And the remnant speaks when others will not speak.

36
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,740
 And the remnant stands when others cannot stand.

37
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,260
 Now look, when we started to do this series

38
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,380
 and put it together, I was just like,

39
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,220
 man, I can't wait to have a moment

40
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,060
 to grab my friends and talk to them

41
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,700
 because what our country needs now is a remnant.

42
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,980
 We need some individuals that are standing strong

43
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,160
 as the whole world drifts away

44
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,640
 from understanding an orthodoxy

45
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,200
 when we start to call good evil and evil good.

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,480
 We need a remnant, people that are courageous

47
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,320
 and people that are strong and people of conviction.

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,100
 Otherwise we're gonna be a whole world to hurt.

49
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,880
 One guy a long time ago said this,

50
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,880
 that it is the final sign of imbecility

51
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,920
 in the people that it calls cat's dogs

52
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,100
 and describes the sun as the moon.

53
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,240
 I've talked about this here before.

54
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,240
 When somebody walks up to you and they look at a dog

55
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,320
 and they go, hey, we're gonna call that tail another leg.

56
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,720
 And then they look at you and they say,

57
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,040
 so therefore how many legs does a dog have?

58
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,540
 Your response should be four.

59
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,180
 I don't really care what you call that tail.

60
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,440
 It's still got four legs.

61
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,880
 And the remnant has got to be a group of people

62
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,360
 that stand courageously.

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,200
 But we ought also be a people that understand

64
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,040
 why we can stand courageously.

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
 And we ought to be a people that understand

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,040
 what the remnant is and what the remnant does

67
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,320
 and how the remnant live.

68
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,400
 And frankly how the remnant are ready to die.

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,560
 That you would stiffen our spines

70
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,960
 and that you would show us things that are true.

71
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,480
 Lord, I thank you that you're not just true,

72
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,040
 that you're good.

73
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,120
 And when we begin to follow you in all the ways

74
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,560
 that you have told us to, it leads to blessing.

75
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,800
 Father, we thank you that you're a God

76
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,280
 that doesn't wanna just call us to a way of life

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,920
 to show how strong you are.

78
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,000
 You call us to something because you strongly love us

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,440
 and you want it to go well with us.

80
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,040
 And it won't go well with us when we live victims of lies.

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,760
 And so steal our hearts with truth.

82
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,600
 Tune our hearts towards the grace of a loving father

83
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,320
 who wants us to flourish.

84
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,560
 Let us be a remnant that causes human flourishing

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,360
 wherever we are in Jesus name, amen.

86
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,600
 Well, that's what I wanna tell you about God

87
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,960
 is he wants you to flourish.

88
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,920
 He wants you to be a blessed people.

89
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,400
 He wants you to be a people that serve

90
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,200
 as a source of blessing to others.

91
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,040
 But you won't ever flourish

92
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,600
 if you live according to false ideas, right?

93
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,120
 Ideas have consequences and bad ideas have victims.

94
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,160
 Jesus said you should know the truth

95
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,560
 and the truth will set you free.

96
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,600
 The scripture says false teachers

97
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,480
 come to steal, kill and destroy.

98
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,880
 The father of lies wants you to go a different direction

99
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,520
 because he hates God and God loves you

100
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,840
 and so he wants to deceive you.

101
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,160
 And you live in a land where more and more

102
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
 truth is on trial.

103
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,040
 And when you speak truth as the remnant,

104
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,480
 it's gonna sound like hate

105
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,380
 because truth always sounds like hate

106
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,580
 to those who hate the truth.

107
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,320
 And so my prayer tonight is as a result of us

108
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,640
 hanging out together is that the remnant in this room

109
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,640
 sees things that they need to see,

110
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,000
 shines and lives in a way that they need to live,

111
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,920
 speaks things that they need to speak

112
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,640
 and stands strong all the way to the end

113
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,120
 because we don't know what's coming.

114
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,040
 But what's great, we know what will come of us

115
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,800
 no matter what's coming in the world that we live in.

116
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,640
 Let me just start with just a good reminder to us

117
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,400
 because people who know Jesus ought to be

118
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,440
 the most humble people on the face of the earth.

119
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,440
 I think there's a mistake that's often made

120
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,000
 that sometimes individuals who have come to know who God is,

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,040
 they think that they're smarter than others

122
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,280
 or the world thinks that we think we're better than others

123
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,400
 and that can never be the case.

124
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,880
 We're individuals that God in his kindness

125
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,680
 has drawn out of darkness into his marvelous light.

126
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,480
 There's a little verse in Matthew

127
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,000
 and it comes in Matthew chapter six

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,960
 and it's kind of an obscure verse.

129
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,000
 It's tucked around some other verses

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,880
 we're not gonna look at

131
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,160
 but I just wanna share this with you.

132
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,280
 It's in Matthew chapter six, verse 22.

133
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
 I'm gonna give you an illustration

134
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,600
 that will help you understand why we ought to be humble.

135
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,240
 It says this, "The eye is the lamp of the body.

136
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,800
 "So then if your eye is clear,

137
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,420
 "your whole body will be full of light.

138
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,480
 "But if your eye is bad,

139
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,320
 "your whole body will be full of darkness.

140
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,200
 "And if the light that is in you is darkness,

141
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,880
 "how great is that darkness."

142
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,200
 And what this is basically talking about

143
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,040
 when Jesus says this

144
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,560
 'cause it's kind of confusing poetic language.

145
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,560
 But what he's saying here is how you view the world

146
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,120
 is gonna determine how you flourish

147
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,840
 or how you suffer in the world.

148
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,180
 And if you perceive the world wrongly,

149
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,760
 if you don't have a lens that is clear,

150
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,240
 you're not going to be able to have truth flood into you.

151
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,160
 In other words, if the filter through which you process

152
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,660
 what you see in the world that you live in

153
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,500
 isn't a biblically informed,

154
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,800
 a theologically informed filter,

155
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,640
 then it's gonna make what's inside of you darkness.

156
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,880
 And when the light that is in you is dark,

157
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,560
 how great will the darkness be?

158
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,480
 I remember when I was a kid, I had a buddy,

159
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,040
 I used to go, we used to play catch at his house

160
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,480
 all the time.

161
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,840
 And then one day, I got over there a little early,

162
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,660
 he wasn't there.

163
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,760
 And so his younger brother and I went out.

164
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,720
 And so, DeMarv, throw me that football up here, all right?

165
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,760
 So you guys know David, right?

166
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,920
 David's a great athlete, is he?

167
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,760
 Is he not?

168
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,580
 Come on up here, David.

169
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,480
 Get that football and come on up here.

170
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,760
 Stand over here with me, all right?

171
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,640
 David Marvin.

172
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,240
 So we used to play catch, right?

173
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,640
 (audience cheering)

174
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,060
 And I was playing catch with this buddy's friend of mine,

175
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,900
 but here's the thing.

176
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,640
 The first time that I started to play catch,

177
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,420
 move a little closer here into the light, David.

178
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,840
 All right, and this is just very simple.

179
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,740
 Here's what I want you to do,

180
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,240
 'cause I didn't know this about my buddy's friend.

181
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,400
 But I had the football for the very first time

182
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,520
 and I went to throw it to him.

183
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,960
 And so David, do me a favor, just put a hand over one eye.

184
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,200
 Put it over, no, put your hand over one eye, all right?

185
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,040
 Now here, catch that.

186
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
 No, here.

187
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,320
 David, come here, come here, come here.

188
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,160
 Hey, that was a bad pass.

189
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,160
 Put a hand over one eye.

190
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,520
 Put a hand over one eye.

191
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,080
 It's not that hard, catch that.

192
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,520
 Catch that.

193
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,640
 There you go, not bad, all right?

194
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,800
 He adjusted pretty quickly.

195
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,600
 All right, put a hand over one eye.

196
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,840
 Go ahead again, right there.

197
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,560
 No, there you go, all right, get out of here.

198
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,400
 All right, now look.

199
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,320
 Was that, you okay?

200
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,160
 I'm sorry, man.

201
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,320
 Come on, let's go.

202
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
 Now look, you look at Marvin, he's a good athlete, right?

203
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,700
 But all of a sudden, all right, you cover up one eye,

204
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,680
 just one eye, okay?

205
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,560
 And all of a sudden, all his depth perception

206
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,380
 was thrown off.

207
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,840
 I put my football to my buddy's friend,

208
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,480
 actually brother, and I fired it at him,

209
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,240
 and it just went, almost took his head off.

210
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,080
 And I go, what in the world just happened?

211
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,120
 And I go, what's wrong with you?

212
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,480
 I kind of said that to him.

213
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,640
 And then I realized that he had one eye that didn't work.

214
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,240
 When he was younger, he and his brother one time

215
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,760
 were playing with a jump rope,

216
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,080
 and actually his brother, they were stretching it out,

217
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,600
 his brother let go of the jump rope

218
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,480
 and had a little elasticity,

219
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,600
 and it came, and the end of it just stung one eye,

220
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,720
 and it made him, in effect, completely blind

221
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,480
 in that one eye, you couldn't really tell it.

222
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,360
 But all of a sudden, I was like,

223
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,560
 man, you're not uncoordinated.

224
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,080
 I wasn't abusive towards him in my speech.

225
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,800
 I realized he didn't have what I had

226
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,120
 as a result of no fault of his own.

227
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,880
 It completely changed his ability to perceive things

228
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,360
 that came at him from a depth perception.

229
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,920
 If you wanna, just a little bit later tonight, man,

230
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,640
 seriously, just across the table from somebody,

231
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,480
 you know, get something out,

232
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,040
 something that won't hurt somebody, right?

233
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,080
 And just about five feet away, cover one eye,

234
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,680
 and just toss it, and you'll say, whoa!

235
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,520
 If you're a good athlete like David, you can adjust.

236
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,480
 This guy eventually learned to adjust a little bit

237
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,440
 and actually played high school baseball,

238
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,640
 if you can imagine that.

239
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,560
 But it affects you when you don't take in things

240
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,820
 and see things correctly.

241
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,880
 Let me just share this with you.

242
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,860
 This is true.

243
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,640
 The Bible in 1 Corinthians 26 and following,

244
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,400
 I just wanna read you some scripture, remnant.

245
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,000
 It says this about people who understand

246
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,880
 and perceive who God is,

247
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,760
 because this is the way we come to understand who God is.

248
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,280
 You're not laying in bed one night,

249
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,960
 and you're going, oh, I believe there's a God.

250
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,920
 He must be a holy, omnipotent, omniscient God.

251
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,880
 He must be so good and so fine

252
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,120
 that there's no way you could ever earn your way to him.

253
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,800
 And therefore, men, despite all his striving,

254
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,180
 could never sanctify himself in such a way

255
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,120
 that he could present himself before this holy God.

256
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,160
 Therefore, there must be a time when God, in his kindness,

257
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,800
 would become found in the form of a man

258
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,840
 and taken in the form of a man

259
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,140
 and being in likeness of a man,

260
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,360
 even though he had no sin, he would go to a cross

261
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,000
 that God might pay a penal substitution

262
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,360
 to cover the sins of men, call atonement,

263
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,800
 draw them to him, and allow them, by grace,

264
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,960
 through faith, to be redeemed.

265
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,360
 You didn't sit in bed and figure that out.

266
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,640
 God, in his kindness, revealed that story to you,

267
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,680
 and even more than that, gave you a tenderness towards him.

268
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,040
 1 Corinthians says this.

269
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,900
 For consider your calling, remnant,

270
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,600
 that there were not many wise according to the flesh,

271
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,480
 not many mighty, not many noble,

272
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,440
 but God has chosen the foolish things of this world

273
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,240
 to shame the wise,

274
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,480
 and God has chosen the weak things of the world

275
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,040
 to shame the things which are strong,

276
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,640
 and the base things of the world,

277
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,760
 and the despised, God has chosen the things that are not

278
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,620
 so that he might nullify the things that are,

279
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,120
 so that no man may boast before God.

280
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,520
 But by doing, but by his doing, you are in Christ Jesus,

281
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,440
 who became to us wisdom from God,

282
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,720
 and righteousness, and then sanctification, and redemption,

283
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,120
 so it is written, let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.

284
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,320
 And so when Paul would go to speak to people,

285
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
 he would start this way.

286
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,560
 And when I go sometimes to speak,

287
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,760
 I've been all over the world to speak,

288
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,360
 and talk about the kindness of God for all men.

289
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,840
 I make it really clear,

290
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,080
 hey, I'm not here to impart to you my own learning,

291
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,880
 I'm not here to impart to you, certainly, Western culture,

292
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,280
 I'm here to share with you the God of all men,

293
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,640
 who loves you and wants you to flourish in your culture.

294
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,820
 I want you to know these truths.

295
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,980
 So this is how Paul would start.

296
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,600
 He would say, when I come to you, brethren,

297
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,080
 I don't come with superiority of speech, or of wisdom,

298
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,360
 but I'm proclaiming to you the testimony of God,

299
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,800
 for I determined to know nothing among you except this,

300
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,880
 Jesus Christ, and him crucified.

301
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,840
 When I'm with you, I'm with you in weakness,

302
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,320
 and in fear, and in much trembling,

303
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,680
 and my message and my preaching

304
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,460
 are not in persuasive words of wisdom,

305
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,700
 but in demonstration of the spirit and of power,

306
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,480
 so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men,

307
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,320
 but on the power of God.

308
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,980
 I'm just gonna tell you the story.

309
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,180
 There's a God who loves you, and by the way,

310
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,860
 this is not just some myth and some fable.

311
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,100
 God dared to do what no other world religious system

312
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,620
 has done, and that is to anchor his story.

313
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,860
 Not just, there's historical figures.

314
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,100
 Buddha was a real historical figure.

315
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,300
 Leaders of Hinduism were real historical figures.

316
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,440
 Leaders of Mormonism are real historical figures.

317
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,340
 Muhammad was a real historical figure.

318
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,940
 But their writings and their revelation are nonsensical.

319
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,500
 And what I mean by that is you can't test them

320
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,680
 and verify them in the context of the story

321
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,620
 that they're written.

322
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,940
 They're descriptions of ideas and philosophies.

323
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,060
 The Quran is beautiful poetry, but you can't test it.

324
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,540
 Like, you can test the scriptures.

325
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,700
 Was there a king called David?

326
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,700
 Was there a leader called Pilate,

327
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,120
 a pro-council called Pilate?

328
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,820
 Was there a man named Jesus?

329
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
 Was there an account of his crucifixion?

330
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,540
 Was there an account of his resurrection?

331
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,340
 And the answer is yes.

332
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,840
 Not just by the eyewitnesses that are in scripture,

333
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,100
 which can't be discounted because they're reliable

334
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,100
 historical documents, but Tacitus, Secundus, Josephus.

335
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,420
 Non-believers, non-followers testified

336
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,620
 to this miraculous event, which turned the world upside down.

337
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,720
 Paul is saying, I'm just relaying to you

338
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,300
 what God in his kindness anchored in history.

339
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,280
 And God in his kindness even pivots

340
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,000
 all of known human existence on the birth

341
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,680
 and the death of this individual.

342
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,520
 Why?

343
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,400
 Because this individual matters.

344
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,040
 And you do well to pay attention to him.

345
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,760
 Paul says, all I'm gonna do is tell you the story.

346
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,280
 And by the kindness of God, I've come to believe the story

347
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,880
 and it has changed me.

348
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,400
 I'm no longer a religious person

349
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,560
 that's trying to make my way to heaven.

350
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,320
 I am now somebody that realized that heaven

351
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,480
 in his kindness has made its way to me.

352
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,080
 And I know that I am not perfect.

353
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,480
 And I believe if God exists, he must be glorious and perfect.

354
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,400
 And so it makes sense to me that no amount of human effort

355
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,760
 could ever build a resume that would be enough to please him.

356
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,160
 And that's what the historical figure Jesus said.

357
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,220
 You wanna have fellowship with me,

358
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,920
 then be perfect as I'm perfect.

359
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:22,460
 I tell you, he says, unless your righteousness surpasses

360
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,360
 the most devoted people of the day,

361
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,800
 you're not gonna enter into the kingdom of heaven.

362
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,920
 In fact, when Jesus was speaking

363
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,240
 to those most religious people, he says this to them.

364
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,880
 In Matthew chapter 15, he's talking to them.

365
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,900
 And watch this, because Jesus is gonna model for us

366
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,240
 one of the points a little bit later

367
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,240
 about how the remnant, the genuine piece of cloth

368
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,640
 will speak the truth.

369
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,200
 There were some Pharisees and some scribes

370
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,340
 that came to Jesus, and they said,

371
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,360
 "Why don't you do what we traditionally do

372
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,920
 "that makes us righteous?"

373
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,100
 And Jesus responds, he goes, "What makes you think

374
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,800
 "your traditions will make you holy in my sight?

375
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,000
 "Why do you transgress the commandments?

376
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,320
 "Because you say things like this,

377
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,860
 "honor your father and mother,

378
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,340
 "and you say things like, you know,

379
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,620
 "the commandment says he who speaks evil

380
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,880
 "of her father and mother is to be put to death.

381
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,600
 "But you say, whoever says this to father and mother,

382
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,460
 "whatever I have would help you,

383
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,420
 "but I've been giving it to God."

384
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,060
 And they came up with a system, basically,

385
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,400
 within their tradition that what we're going to do

386
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,020
 is leaders of the temple is,

387
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,660
 I'm not gonna support my mother and father,

388
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,180
 I'm going to give to the temple treasury,

389
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,940
 which, by the way, is my future savings account

390
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,740
 and that which I draw from to live by.

391
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,220
 And so instead of taking care of their father and mother,

392
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,340
 these religious leaders said,

393
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,060
 "No, we have to give it to God, it's been sworn to God."

394
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,580
 So they wouldn't care for their immediate family,

395
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,620
 so in the name of religion,

396
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,300
 they could care more for themselves.

397
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,880
 And he said, "This is not the way of God, you hypocrite.

398
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,600
 "Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you."

399
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,740
 Listen to what Jesus says.

400
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,400
 "You people honor me with your lips,

401
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,980
 "but your heart is far from me.

402
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,760
 "In vain do you say you exalt me,

403
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,560
 "because you teach as the doctrines of God

404
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,840
 "the precepts of men."

405
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,660
 Now, when the remnant speaks this way,

406
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,500
 I just wanna show you this,

407
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
 this is a little prequel to where we're going.

408
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,340
 His disciples say, "Hey, man,

409
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,860
 "don't you know that when you said this,

410
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,300
 "that that offended the Pharisees right there in verse 12?

411
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,460
 "They didn't like it."

412
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,760
 And Jesus said, "Well, let me just tell you something.

413
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,400
 "Every plant which my heavy father did not plant,

414
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,040
 "everything that's not rooted and grounded

415
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,600
 "in a faith relationship with God is gonna be uprooted."

416
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,760
 And he says this then, verse 14.

417
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,920
 "Let them alone.

418
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,380
 "They are blind guides of the blind.

419
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,500
 "They don't see.

420
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,000
 "And when a blind man leads a blind man,

421
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,040
 "they both fall into a pit."

422
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,540
 And so Jesus is saying,

423
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,620
 "You better make sure that the ones you're following

424
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,920
 "are gonna really lead you to life indeed.

425
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,340
 "And life indeed is not found

426
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,660
 "through the traditions of men and the ways of men.

427
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,360
 "No, life indeed is found through the one who has come

428
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,940
 "to reconcile you to a holy God who said,

429
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,280
 "'I am God myself,' and I'm gonna demonstrate to you

430
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,440
 "what holiness looks like,

431
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,940
 "and I'm gonna demonstrate to you what love looks like,

432
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,600
 "because none of you are like me.

433
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,760
 "And yet I'm going to take the punishment that is due you

434
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,480
 "so an infinitely holy and perfect God

435
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,960
 "who while he wants to love you has to be infinitely just

436
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,600
 "because God will never sacrifice one aspect

437
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,240
 "of his character for another."

438
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,800
 And so God has come not just to show love,

439
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,140
 but to satisfy his own justice.

440
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,980
 Jesus says, "I'm gonna go to the cross

441
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,120
 "for the glory of the Father, not just 'cause I love you,

442
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,800
 "but because I love the righteousness of the Father,

443
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,380
 "and there's gonna be an infinitely perfect sacrifice

444
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,000
 "made for the Father so that the Father can then

445
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,740
 "in his kindness and justly offer life to you."

446
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,640
 It's called the gospel.

447
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,640
 It's the good news, it's the great exchange.

448
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,220
 That he made him who knew no sin to become sin

449
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,160
 on your behalf that you might become

450
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,680
 the righteousness of God in him.

451
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,680
 That Jesus, though he was rich for your sake, became poor.

452
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,080
 That through his poverty you might be made rich.

453
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,560
 Some of you come from pharisaical backgrounds

454
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,800
 where you still think that what you do

455
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,640
 is what's gonna make you acceptable to God.

456
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,880
 And God has gotta tune your hearts to grace.

457
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,760
 And everybody's hearing my words tonight,

458
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,640
 but some of you have never believed

459
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,720
 that you need a savior.

460
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,480
 Some of you have never abandoned your own will and way

461
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,360
 and said, "Todd, I'll take the savior Jesus Christ.

462
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,640
 "I believe that there is one who has given his life for me

463
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,260
 "and that God declared with power that Jesus is Lord

464
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,820
 "by raising him from the dead."

465
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,360
 And by the way, you're not gonna just have

466
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,960
 the knowledge, okay, 'cause knowledge itself

467
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,400
 is not the same as seeing.

468
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,880
 Seeing is a spiritual gift.

469
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,400
 Men can get knowledge, but only the gift of seeing God

470
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,560
 and seeing that truth that knowledge talks about

471
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,960
 is for you, is a gift of God.

472
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,600
 Jumping back to 1 Corinthians, Paul goes on and says,

473
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,240
 "I'm gonna speak this wisdom," in verse six,

474
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,720
 "not just to those who are mature.

475
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,020
 "I'm gonna speak a wisdom not of this age,

476
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,380
 "but we speak God's wisdom."

477
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,980
 It's a mystery.

478
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,860
 "The hidden wisdom which God predestined

479
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,240
 "before the ages to our glory."

480
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,540
 He's saying the story of Christ has been anticipated

481
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,760
 all through Scripture, but now it's being revealed.

482
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,560
 "The wisdom which none of the rulers of this age

483
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,420
 "has understood, for if they had understood it,

484
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,920
 "they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."

485
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,280
 But then he says this, quoting from the Old Testament,

486
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,000
 "Things which eye hasn't seen,

487
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,640
 "things which ear hasn't heard,

488
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,640
 "things which don't even enter into the heart of men,

489
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,520
 "all that God has prepared for those who love him.

490
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,160
 "For to us, God revealed them through the Spirit,

491
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,620
 "for the Spirit searches all things,

492
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,860
 "even the depths of God.

493
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,660
 "For who among men knows the thoughts of a man

494
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,400
 "except the Spirit of a man which is in him?

495
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,040
 "Even so, the thoughts of God,

496
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,100
 "no one knows except the Spirit of God."

497
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,340
 And watch about these amazing words, remnant.

498
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,060
 "Now we have received not the Spirit of the world,

499
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,640
 "but the Spirit who is from God,

500
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,520
 "so that we may know the things freely given to us by God,

501
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,780
 "which things we also speak,

502
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,440
 "not in words taught by human wisdom,

503
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,880
 "but in those taught by the Spirit,

504
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,520
 "combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words."

505
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,080
 But watch this, natural man doesn't have the ability

506
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,620
 to perceive that, it's a gift of God.

507
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,040
 Natural man does not accept the things

508
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,740
 of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness to him,

509
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,760
 and he cannot understand them

510
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,560
 because they are not spiritually appraised.

511
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,480
 Now listen, whenever you talk like this,

512
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,620
 and you talk about the works that God is doing in grace,

513
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,460
 is some people go,

514
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,720
 "Well, how do I know I'm spiritually appraised?

515
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,080
 "How do I know that God wants me to know those things?"

516
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,920
 Here's the answer, all through Scripture,

517
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,260
 whenever God talks about what's called efficacious grace,

518
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,280
 what's ever called, what's ever meant by predestination,

519
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,280
 or divine calling, or election,

520
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,000
 God is saying to all men everywhere,

521
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,720
 "Come, I died for the sins of the world."

522
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,000
 But then he just says to everybody,

523
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,360
 "Listen, no one can come unless you're called."

524
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,800
 And you might go, "Well, how do I know if I'm called?"

525
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,720
 The answer is come, come.

526
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,000
 Come all who are weary and heavy laden,

527
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,400
 come all who have experienced enough brokenness,

528
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,800
 and who are sick and tired of being sick and tired,

529
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,920
 who don't just wanna go and have a workspace religion

530
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,660
 where you attend spiritual services,

531
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,840
 but you know that if there is not a God

532
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,600
 who rescues you from sin and death,

533
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,160
 and the Spirit inside of you,

534
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,720
 which has a strategy and a plan which seems right to you,

535
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,320
 but you know is not working out,

536
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,040
 come all you who want a God who cares for you,

537
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,040
 and loves you, and wants to instruct you

538
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,960
 in the way that you should go, come.

539
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,800
 And when you come, it's like there's a huge banner here.

540
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,600
 It says, "Come all you who are weary."

541
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,660
 And as you walk underneath it to the glory of God,

542
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,960
 into his marvelous light, and you turn around to thank him,

543
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,360
 you see in this side of the banner,

544
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,360
 "Only those who by the grace of God have been called of him."

545
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,640
 And I'm gonna just tell you with absolute certainty,

546
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,320
 if you are part of the remnant,

547
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,340
 it's because of the grace of God.

548
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,880
 It's not because you're smarter than anybody else,

549
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,280
 or better than anybody else.

550
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,880
 And what I'm telling you, remnant,

551
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,000
 is you ought to be the most humble people

552
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,960
 on the face of the earth.

553
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,360
 And you ought to not ever look at somebody and go,

554
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,640
 "How could they do that?

555
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,580
 "You know, I don't do that."

556
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,560
 Last night I was here on Monday nights,

557
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,440
 we have this thing called regeneration.

558
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,040
 And I always say this, the healthiest people at Watermark

559
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,300
 are folks that come to this thing on Monday night,

560
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,920
 because it's a place that folks are looking

561
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,980
 to deal with the brokenness that's in their life.

562
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,020
 Some of it's physiological and psychological,

563
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,800
 some of it is chemical dependency,

564
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,880
 unhealthy emotional attachment to things or ideas

565
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,440
 or chemicals that have ruined their life.

566
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:51,060
 Last night, I saw a guy standing there

567
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,900
 and not talking to anybody,

568
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,000
 so I just walked up, introduced myself to him.

569
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,240
 And I said, "Man, how you doing?

570
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,080
 "Have you been here before?"

571
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,900
 He said, "No, I've never been here before."

572
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,740
 I said, "Well, welcome."

573
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,820
 He said, "Do you have any idea who I was?"

574
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,140
 I just said, "I'm so glad you're here."

575
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,860
 He goes, "Well, I'm not here for me, I'm here for my son."

576
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,980
 I go, "Fantastic, so where's your son?"

577
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,320
 He goes, "Well, he's in the restroom."

578
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,860
 And he goes, "My son's life is broken,

579
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,900
 "and I heard that he can get help here."

580
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:20,060
 His son was in his 20s, just like a lot of you,

581
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,980
 and when he came out, his son walked up literally like this,

582
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,660
 kind of sideways, and if I'm standing where that podium is,

583
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,100
 he kind of walked up like this.

584
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,220
 His dad was standing right here, and I was there,

585
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,260
 and his name was Jeffrey.

586
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,700
 I go, "Hey, hey, Jeffrey, how you doing?"

587
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,380
 And he just, he couldn't even look at me.

588
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,540
 He was just like, "I'm all right, I'm all right."

589
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,820
 And he kept doing this to me.

590
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,420
 And you know, I just did this,

591
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,660
 and I eventually just moved around to where he was,

592
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,500
 and I got down.

593
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,100
 I go, "Hey, Jeffrey, man, look at me."

594
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,680
 I go, "I have felt just like you,

595
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,920
 "where I couldn't lift my eyes up.

596
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,380
 "I couldn't look at myself in a mirror.

597
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,120
 "I certainly couldn't look at holy God.

598
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,180
 "I didn't wanna look at anybody else."

599
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,000
 And I'm gonna tell you what,

600
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,180
 this is what the Bible says about my God.

601
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,540
 "Thou, O Lord, you're a shield around me.

602
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,820
 "You're my glory, and you're the lifter of my head."

603
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,660
 "Jeffrey, look at me.

604
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,740
 "Look at me, man, you're at the right place."

605
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,260
 God wants to lift you out of your guilt and shame.

606
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,660
 He wants to tell you how much he loves you.

607
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,940
 "Jeffrey, look at me.

608
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,900
 "Jeffrey, God loves you,

609
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,360
 "not because of anything you're gonna do,

610
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,980
 "but because he's just that kind of good God,

611
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,680
 "and you're in the right place."

612
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,060
 Now, I have no idea if Jeffrey's gonna accept

613
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,900
 that offer of love,

614
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,120
 but I didn't look down on Jeffrey for a second,

615
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,640
 because when I say all the time,

616
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,940
 and there with the grace of God go,

617
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,660
 I know that, man, I'm gonna tell you something.

618
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,340
 Apart from Jesus Christ,

619
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,060
 I would ruin my life, ruin my wife's life.

620
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,040
 My kids would hate me.

621
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,880
 I'd be a porn addict.

622
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,540
 I'd be an adulterer.

623
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,020
 I'd be selfish and arrogant.

624
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,420
 I'd be a danger to all who met me.

625
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:55,020
 And yet the kindness of God has shown me

626
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,380
 how to flourish.

627
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,180
 And by the grace of God, that's not my story.

628
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:05,480
 And it has nothing to do with me,

629
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,220
 except that God gave me a tender heart to believe him,

630
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,900
 trust him, and to test his ways.

631
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,740
 I've got a buddy who said this to me,

632
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,140
 'cause he all but ruined his life,

633
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,640
 and he said, "I spent the last 10 years of my life

634
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,000
 "testing the warnings of God,

635
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,620
 "and I found out that they are true.

636
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,380
 "And I now purpose to spend the rest of my life

637
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,000
 "to test his promises."

638
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,520
 That was a guy that embezzled over six figures

639
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,240
 from a brother that he was working with.

640
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,020
 That this morning I was away on a staff retreat

641
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,700
 with this man who's been so redeemed,

642
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,380
 he's now a leader in ministry,

643
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,660
 and I've watched him test the promises of God,

644
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,780
 and I've seen the flourishing that's come to his life,

645
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,440
 and I invite you to join us.

646
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,260
 But let me just say this to you, remnant.

647
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,340
 You ought to be the most humble people on earth.

648
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,020
 That you have already seen

649
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,380
 what one day the world's gonna see.

650
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,100
 That the clouds are gonna be rolled back like a scroll,

651
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,420
 and the King of kings who is raised from the dead,

652
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,820
 who is sitting now at the right hand of God,

653
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,340
 who is God, is gonna return,

654
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,080
 immortal, as God only wise,

655
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,420
 and every knee will bow,

656
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,740
 and every tongue will confess,

657
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,020
 and what they will confess

658
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,720
 is what the remnant already sees.

659
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,460
 And if you know that,

660
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:29,060
 you have a responsibility.

661
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,020
 What's the responsibility?

662
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,060
 The responsibility is this,

663
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,500
 the remnant shines when others are not.

664
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,600
 This was God's plan from the very beginning.

665
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,140
 In Deuteronomy chapter four,

666
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,060
 he says this to the nation that he chose

667
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,100
 from amongst the nations.

668
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,760
 They were pagans like everybody else.

669
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,300
 They had systems of righteousness

670
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,460
 that made sense to men like everybody else,

671
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,340
 and God chose to reveal himself to a group of people

672
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,140
 so those people could walk with him,

673
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,520
 and there would be such flourishing in their community

674
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,740
 that other nations would come to them and say,

675
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,220
 "Who are you people?

676
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,620
 "Who is your God?"

677
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,060
 And they wouldn't say, "We're better than you."

678
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,220
 They would say, "We want you to know our God

679
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,340
 "because our God is your God.

680
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,360
 "He is the only God who created the heavens and the earth,

681
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,420
 "and he loves you,

682
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,560
 "and so we're gonna be kind to you."

683
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,280
 Deuteronomy four,

684
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,960
 "Now as you are listening to the statutes and the judgments

685
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,420
 "which I'm teaching you to perform,

686
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,120
 "so that," watch why God gives us statutes and judgments

687
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,240
 'cause he's the loving father,

688
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,960
 "so that you might live and go in and take possession

689
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,480
 "of the land which the Lord, your God of your fathers

690
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,320
 "is giving you.

691
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,160
 "You shall not add to the word which I'm commanding you."

692
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,640
 Don't take away from it.

693
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,640
 You can't make it better, don't make it worse.

694
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,080
 Keep my commands.

695
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,680
 Your eyes have seen what has happened

696
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,520
 to those who worship false gods,

697
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,240
 how God has destroyed the world,

698
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,960
 how God has destroyed people who trust in the wrong things,

699
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,560
 but you held fast to the Lord, your God.

700
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,000
 You're alive today, every one of you,

701
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,520
 you're living, you're full of life.

702
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,000
 You've not been killed or destroyed.

703
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,760
 See, I've taught you statutes and judgments

704
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,560
 just as the Lord, my God, commanded me.

705
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,640
 This is Moses talking that you should do this in the land

706
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,960
 where you are entering to possess it.

707
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,460
 So watch what he says in verse six.

708
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,460
 "So keep them, remnant, and do them, remnant,

709
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,760
 "for that is wisdom,

710
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,340
 "and your understanding of the sight of the people

711
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,100
 "will hear all these statutes and say,

712
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,720
 "Surely this nation is a wise and understanding people."

713
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,480
 You see, why God wants you to live

714
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,640
 in subjection to his will and way

715
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,080
 is because when you live in subjection to his will and way

716
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,000
 and not influenced by the zeitgeist,

717
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,360
 by the culture of the day,

718
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,880
 by the way of your college campuses,

719
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,960
 by the way of your workaday world,

720
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,760
 by the way of your materialistic city,

721
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,320
 but when you live with an eye that understands this world

722
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,560
 and why there's trouble in it

723
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,840
 and why there's betrayal in it

724
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,300
 and why there's temptation in it,

725
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,020
 and when you live with the wisdom of God who cares for you,

726
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,900
 people look at you and they may not like what you say

727
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,300
 and they may curse you

728
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,420
 because you tell them they're accountable to a holy God,

729
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,940
 but they will go, "You are a wise and understanding people.

730
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,180
 "Your marriages are better, your families are better,

731
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:06,180
 "your dating lives are better, you sleep better."

732
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,700
 There is truth in your lives.

733
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,400
 This is 1 Peter 2:12.

734
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,620
 Keep your behavior excellent among those who don't know God

735
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:24,260
 so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers

736
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,300
 because they say you know truth

737
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,060
 and that there's only one set of truth,

738
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,060
 they may because of the fruit of that truth in your life

739
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,260
 as they observe them,

740
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,660
 give glory to God on the day of visitation

741
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,460
 because they go, "God, we knew you were real

742
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,380
 "because we met people who say they knew you

743
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,900
 "and we saw them flourish."

744
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,540
 And so the remnant shines.

745
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:52,300
 When Paul wrote a letter to a group of people

746
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,540
 who lived in a town called Philippi,

747
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,920
 he said this to them, he said,

748
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,120
 "Listen, man, don't do anything from selfishness

749
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,600
 "or empty conceit, but with humility of mind,

750
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,520
 "consider one another as more important than yourself.

751
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,180
 "Don't merely look out for your own personal interests,

752
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,480
 "but also for the interests of others.

753
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,980
 "Have in yourself the same attitude

754
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,140
 "which was in Christ Jesus."

755
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,100
 And it goes on, describes the life of Christ

756
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,920
 and it says, "He became obedient

757
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,760
 "even to the point of death, death at a cross.

758
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,320
 "He gave himself away for others

759
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,580
 "because he was the perfect embodiment

760
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,980
 "of what God wanted man to look like.

761
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,180
 "He was just like you.

762
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,560
 "He was made in the likeness of a man

763
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,340
 "and he was found in appearance of a man,"

764
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,060
 it says in Philippians 2,

765
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,500
 "but he humbled himself."

766
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,260
 He didn't regard equality with God

767
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,540
 a thing to be held onto,

768
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,480
 but he said, "No, I'm gonna live as a man.

769
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,180
 "I'm gonna take on the form of man.

770
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,140
 "I'm gonna live as a man and I'm gonna trust God.

771
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,780
 "I'm gonna walk according to his ways."

772
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,000
 And he walked according to his ways and he was glorious.

773
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,700
 And because he was so glorious,

774
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,480
 God said he's gonna give him the name above all names,

775
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,960
 gave him the name above all names.

776
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,760
 That one day at the name of Jesus, as I've already said,

777
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,560
 every knee will bow and every tongue will confess.

778
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,920
 And then it picks it back up.

779
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,220
 He says in verse 12, "So then," in light of Jesus,

780
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,520
 in light of the beauty of Jesus,

781
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,280
 "So then my beloved, just as you've always obeyed,

782
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,160
 "not just in my presence only, but more in my absence,

783
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,340
 "continue to work out your salvation

784
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,820
 "with fear and trembling because you know it's at stake.

785
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,820
 "What's at stake is the world knowing who Jesus is."

786
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,320
 Notice what he didn't say there.

787
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,180
 He didn't say, "Therefore, my beloved brethren,

788
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:25,420
 "work for your salvation because the remnant knows

789
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,840
 "it can never earn a perfect God's love."

790
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,120
 It just says, "In light of the love of the perfect God,

791
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,320
 "make sure you walk with him.

792
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,400
 "For it is now, if you have a relationship

793
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,860
 "with God and remnant, it is God at work in you,

794
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,600
 "both the will and the work for his good pleasure."

795
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,840
 What's God's good pleasure?

796
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,060
 That the world would see his goodness in you.

797
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,720
 That you don't live for your own pleasure,

798
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,440
 you don't live for your own fame,

799
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,960
 you live for the good of others.

800
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,960
 And they're gonna see in you the love of God.

801
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,160
 And so whatever you do, you do all without grumbling

802
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,720
 or disputing, verse 14.

803
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,040
 And then it says this in verse 15, "Watch, remnant,

804
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,120
 "because the remnant shines when others are not shining."

805
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,600
 He says, "Prove yourself to be blameless and innocent,

806
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,860
 "not so you can be saved, but because you have

807
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,980
 "a relationship with a blameless and innocent God.

808
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,040
 "You're childs of God, above reproach,

809
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,760
 "who live in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation

810
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,440
 "among whom you appear as lights in the world.

811
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,800
 "The remnant shines when others do not."

812
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,100
 Let me ask you a question.

813
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:39,340
 If you were the only remnant on Earth,

814
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,380
 what would others think about the beauty

815
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,820
 of what your God creates?

816
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:50,100
 It is an amazing privilege to be somebody

817
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,860
 who gets to be God's ambassador,

818
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,500
 who gets to represent him to a watching world,

819
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,220
 who gets to say, "I used to live the way you did,

820
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,660
 "trusting in my flesh, following the course of this world,

821
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,620
 "listening to the deceptive spirits of the age.

822
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,580
 "But now I know that there is a God who is good

823
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,180
 "and is true and who's loving,

824
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,220
 "who doesn't want me to perform anything for him,

825
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,400
 "but he calls me and invites me to walk

826
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,220
 "in the blessing of his way and to have understanding

827
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,400
 "about why there is hardship in the world.

828
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,840
 "And so it is well with my soul.

829
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:26,300
 "And I don't need to manipulate and abuse people.

830
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,780
 "I'm not a slave to my fleshly lusts

831
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,300
 "which wage war against my own dignity.

832
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,160
 "I don't have to cope with my pain

833
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,720
 "by numbing myself with medication or alcohol

834
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,000
 "or other substances.

835
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,860
 "I can look myself in the mirror

836
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,500
 "and say by the grace of God,

837
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,480
 "the glory that he intended me as a male

838
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,180
 "or a woman to live in, I am living in.

839
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,620
 "And God is kind because in all the ways that I don't,

840
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,920
 "his grace is sufficient for me."

841
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,660
 Remnant, do people see that in you?

842
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,340
 Do they see a humility in you?

843
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,620
 And do they see an attentiveness to his way?

844
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,420
 And are you bright and shining stars

845
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,760
 in the midst of a dark and perverse generation?

846
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,200
 Let me just throw this out to you

847
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,460
 because what do so many people say

848
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,800
 is the reason they don't believe in Jesus?

849
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,180
 They go, "Because his people are hypocrites."

850
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,780
 Let me just say something to you.

851
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,760
 When you sin, you're not a hypocrite.

852
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,000
 All of us, I've known Jesus for 30 plus years.

853
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,880
 I still at times don't trust in the Lord with all my heart.

854
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,200
 I don't not lean on my own understanding.

855
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,060
 I do, I follow my own way.

856
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,400
 And in doing so, I'm not being faithful

857
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,520
 in that moment as God's remnant.

858
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,000
 That doesn't make me a hypocrite.

859
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,020
 A hypocrite is not somebody who says

860
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,140
 that these are mistakes and makes those mistakes.

861
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,440
 A hypocrite is somebody who says these are mistakes

862
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,880
 and then when they make them says,

863
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,720
 "Well, they're not a mistake for me."

864
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,040
 Do you understand that?

865
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:57,840
 So remnant, we don't act like we don't sin.

866
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,800
 When we sin, we go, "You know what?

867
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,500
 "That was me again.

868
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,400
 "What you just saw, that flash of anger,

869
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:15,040
 "that surrender to lust, that insecurity,

870
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,880
 "that tendency towards people pleasing,

871
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,860
 "can I just tell you something?

872
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,040
 "That was me again.

873
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,400
 "That was me not trusting in the kindness of my God

874
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,360
 "that I know His ways are right and true."

875
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,600
 It doesn't make you a hypocrite when you sin.

876
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,640
 You're under judgment.

877
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,480
 That's what it literally means.

878
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,000
 Hippo, which means under, and kritos,

879
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,280
 which means to judge.

880
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,980
 Hypocrites, you're under judgment when you say,

881
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,680
 "That's wrong," and then you do it and go,

882
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,360
 "Well, it's not wrong for me."

883
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,360
 That's a hypocrite.

884
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:43,880
 So one of the ways you shine,

885
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,400
 do you know what one of my greatest ministries is?

886
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,440
 You know, something I get to do to glorify God

887
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,800
 that Jesus never did

888
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,080
 is when I screw up, which Jesus never did,

889
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,340
 I get to own it, and I get to go to people

890
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,560
 and seek their forgiveness and restore the relationship

891
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,000
 and make amends, and I confess.

892
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,680
 The word confess means to agree.

893
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,340
 I agree, hey, that wasn't of God.

894
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,680
 And I don't just go and just say, "Hey, I'm sorry."

895
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,520
 You know what?

896
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,340
 When you say, "I'm sorry,"

897
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,420
 you know what the right biblical response is

898
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,120
 when somebody screws up and goes, "Hey, I'm sorry."

899
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,760
 You know what you should say when somebody says that?

900
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,240
 You should go, "Well, I agree with you.

901
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,880
 "That was a sorry thing to do."

902
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,800
 But I've made lots of sorrowful choices in my life,

903
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,400
 and man, if now that you've declared that you're sorry,

904
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,200
 that what you did is wrong,

905
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,800
 I've already in my heart forgiven you,

906
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,200
 but if you want that transaction to be completed,

907
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,160
 man, I'd love to forgive you, but just ask.

908
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,040
 And that means when you screw up with somebody else

909
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,880
 and just go, "Hey, I'm sorry.

910
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,040
 "That wasn't my best moment,"

911
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,400
 you need to say, "Guys, I need to ask your forgiveness."

912
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,500
 And you won't use this language,

913
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,340
 but what you're saying is,

914
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,760
 'cause I'm part of the remnant,

915
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,920
 that no God's ways are good,

916
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,420
 and just then I didn't do God's ways.

917
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,800
 And I'm sure it hurt you and probably even confused you.

918
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,720
 Will you forgive me?

919
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,160
 That's shining remnant.

920
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,680
 The remnant sees what others can't see.

921
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,760
 The remnant shines when others aren't shining,

922
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,360
 and the remnant speaks when others will not.

923
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,400
 It's about to get tough, people.

924
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,240
 You ready?

925
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,800
 Because this is what the remnant has to do.

926
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,000
 We have got to continue to speak.

927
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,160
 There is a problem in our culture today,

928
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,560
 and it's all around us.

929
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,560
 I mean, you see it, like I told you at the very beginning.

930
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,280
 It's the final sign of imbecility in people

931
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,120
 when they call cats dogs and describe the sun as the moon.

932
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,000
 And you live in a day and age,

933
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,320
 and what you're really seeing, what's happening right now,

934
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,240
 what I'm gonna call our transgender moment,

935
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,800
 and it's called a transgender moment

936
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,760
 because we're not gonna hang here long.

937
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,320
 We can't hang here long.

938
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:58,320
 It is an unlivable world to say that gender is not binary,

939
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,720
 that it's a social construct.

940
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,320
 But one of the things that is happening right now

941
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,520
 is your generation has been educated and taught

942
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,080
 that if you're loving, you're gonna let people do

943
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,160
 what they want to do, including to assign to themselves

944
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,960
 a gender that is inconsistent with their biological,

945
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,920
 God-given, glorious gender identity.

946
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,760
 And it is not loving to enable people

947
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,080
 in their dysphoria and in their confusion.

948
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,920
 You need to know something.

949
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,600
 There was not a sudden surge of scientific understanding

950
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,360
 of this reality called gender dysphoria

951
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,680
 and how we should treat it, no.

952
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,080
 This has been a progressive ideology of people

953
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,040
 who have come to steal, kill, and destroy,

954
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,680
 told by liars that are gonna tell you

955
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,280
 that gender identity is distinct

956
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,280
 from bodily biological assignment,

957
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,840
 and that you can know that you're something different

958
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,560
 than what your biological assignment is,

959
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,240
 even at a young age, and that the most kind thing

960
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,920
 that you can do is to begin to give people hormones

961
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,080
 and therapy to help them pursue a different gender

962
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,960
 than they're assigned to.

963
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,360
 And in fact, they're gonna tell you that preventing

964
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,240
 or delaying that transition can lead

965
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,120
 to really serious psychological harm,

966
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,240
 perhaps even inducing suicide in those people.

967
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,400
 And I need to tell you something.

968
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,240
 It's a lie.

969
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:27,840
 Listen, tolerance in personal relationships is a virtue,

970
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,440
 but tolerance where truth is concerned is a travesty.

971
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,160
 Despising people because they're not good and perfect

972
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,880
 is not good, but saying that everything is equally good

973
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,680
 and perfect is despicable and not loving.

974
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,800
 And one of the things the remnant does

975
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,320
 is they don't confuse loving what others do

976
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,160
 with loving others.

977
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,000
 They are kind, they are wise, they are a friend,

978
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,040
 but they speak the truth.

979
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,120
 Even if the world doesn't like it.

980
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,680
 Guys, you need to know that for so long,

981
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,360
 what did you get on the remnant about?

982
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,080
 Like, oh, you remnant people, you're people of faith.

983
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,240
 You're not about science, as if there's some contradiction

984
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,720
 between science and faith.

985
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,240
 They go, I'm a reasonable person.

986
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,000
 Well, the opposite of reason is not faith.

987
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,720
 The opposite of reason is irrationality.

988
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,880
 The opposite of faith is non-belief.

989
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,960
 What's so interesting is for years,

990
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,920
 they came across the remnant and they said,

991
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,400
 you're just not scientific people.

992
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,360
 And now, if there's anything that science is certain about

993
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,400
 is that this is a male and this is a female,

994
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,440
 they go, well, yeah, don't be so bigoted.

995
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:44,720
 Because it has nothing to do, it never did with science.

996
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,040
 It has everything to do with the desire

997
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,080
 to do what thou wilt.

998
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:55,960
 And the remnant is not gonna be silent.

999
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,200
 A remnant is gonna continue to speak.

1000
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,680
 A remnant is gonna do it in love.

1001
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,880
 Faithful are the wounds of a friend,

1002
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,720
 but deceitful are the kisses of an enemy.

1003
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,760
 The remnant speaks when others will not.

1004
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,200
 And I'm gonna tell you, there was a lady

1005
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,720
 by the name of Elizabeth Noel Newman.

1006
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,480
 Elizabeth Noel Newman was a Nazi propagandist.

1007
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,760
 She actually wrote for fascist newspapers

1008
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,640
 and she advanced fascist ideology.

1009
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,000
 And once the war was over,

1010
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,280
 she made her way, actually became a professor

1011
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,120
 in the States and she actually wrote a book in 1974

1012
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,880
 called "The Spiral of Silence."

1013
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,040
 And she admitted the errors of some of the ideology

1014
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,320
 which she represented, but she said,

1015
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,520
 "You need to know something.

1016
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,440
 "This is how a country gets like Germany."

1017
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,280
 Edmund Burke said this centuries before Germany.

1018
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,920
 He said, "All that is required for evil to persist

1019
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,640
 "is for good men to do nothing."

1020
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,400
 The remnant are the good.

1021
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,320
 Elizabeth Noel Newman said,

1022
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,840
 "What you do in the spiral of silence

1023
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,920
 "is that you ridicule.

1024
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,600
 "Ridicule is one of our most potent weapons.

1025
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,480
 "We marginalize opponents.

1026
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,200
 "We personalize and polarize the target.

1027
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,880
 "We undermine their legitimacy.

1028
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,080
 "We make a certain group of people look stupid or evil.

1029
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,440
 "We call them anti-science, bigots, delusional.

1030
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,760
 "We mock them."

1031
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,480
 What happens is we start to have progressive elites

1032
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,760
 say things that are out there.

1033
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,640
 And most people will say,

1034
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,600
 "Well, that doesn't really affect me."

1035
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,640
 There's a famous phrase by somebody who said,

1036
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,560
 "They came for the trade unionists,

1037
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,680
 "and I didn't speak up 'cause I wasn't a trade unionist.

1038
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,600
 "They came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak up

1039
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,520
 "because I wasn't a Catholic.

1040
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,680
 "They came for the homosexuals,

1041
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,520
 "and I didn't speak up 'cause I wasn't a homosexual.

1042
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,440
 "They came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up

1043
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,480
 "because I wasn't a Jew.

1044
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,640
 "And then they came for me,

1045
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,880
 "but nobody spoke up 'cause nobody was left."

1046
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,480
 And what loving people do

1047
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,920
 is they see somebody else being oppressed.

1048
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,120
 And whether they're part of that oppressed group or not,

1049
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,800
 if it's unjust and wrong, they speak up.

1050
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,880
 And even though they're part of the majority culture

1051
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,840
 who's not being attacked,

1052
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,520
 they go, "I'm not gonna let this power attack that person."

1053
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,960
 And they might get thrown into the people being attacked,

1054
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,200
 but most people won't do that.

1055
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,200
 They take a, "Hey, this is not gonna affect me" mentality.

1056
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,760
 And what happens is over a period of time,

1057
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,200
 people start to watch,

1058
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,440
 and they don't wanna be out of step

1059
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,560
 with what continues to be now

1060
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,760
 the louder and louder and louder narrative.

1061
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:32,920
 Until finally, only one or two people speak up,

1062
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,960
 and when they speak up, they are ridiculed,

1063
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,800
 they're called stupid or evil,

1064
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,200
 they're polarized, they're attacked,

1065
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,640
 and then everybody else goes, "Well, I'm not gonna speak up."

1066
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,880
 And then when nobody speaks up,

1067
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,800
 everybody else looks around and go,

1068
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,520
 "You know, this doesn't look right to me,

1069
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,240
 "but since nobody else is speaking up, I guess it's right."

1070
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,160
 And the next thing you know, that spiral of silence,

1071
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,000
 even though it started

1072
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,620
 with a very small group of powerful people,

1073
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,360
 it becomes the narrative of the land.

1074
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,440
 The remnant cannot let that be so.

1075
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,280
 The remnant speaks.

1076
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,380
 It's your job, it's your privilege.

1077
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,880
 It's the most loving thing you can do.

1078
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,400
 Just to give you some science,

1079
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,000
 I mean, if you don't understand what's going on,

1080
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,860
 I mean, Vanderbilt University did a study.

1081
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,920
 Given time, kids that are being told

1082
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,400
 that if you're loving, you'll let yourself

1083
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,000
 express yourself however you want,

1084
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,200
 which has never in the history of civilization

1085
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,920
 been the narrative that you should let kids define reality.

1086
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,160
 But these kids that maybe are starting

1087
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,200
 to feel stuff at a young age,

1088
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,600
 probably because society's telling them

1089
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,480
 that they should feel that way,

1090
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,880
 and they're seeing all kinds of pictures

1091
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,080
 of folks feeling that way,

1092
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,800
 it says if you just let them alone,

1093
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,060
 80 to 95% of them will spontaneously reverse back

1094
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,560
 to what is their biological gender.

1095
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:55,840
 They did a study in Sweden at the Karolinska Institute.

1096
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,760
 They looked at people who actually

1097
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,160
 went through gender transition.

1098
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,280
 They followed over 30 years,

1099
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,800
 324 people had sex reassignment surgery.

1100
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,400
 They found out that decades after their surgery,

1101
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,960
 not only were they no happier

1102
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,800
 than those who didn't make the transition,

1103
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,960
 but they were 20 times more likely to take their life.

1104
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,260
 Folks, this is just one of the many examples

1105
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,700
 where we go like, gosh, who am I to tell somebody

1106
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,460
 that how they feel isn't right?

1107
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,120
 Listen, I've said it a thousand times,

1108
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,180
 feelings are real, they're not reliable.

1109
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,280
 You don't follow your heart, you inform your heart.

1110
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,260
 You don't conform yourself to the culture,

1111
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,500
 you're transformed by the renewing of your mind,

1112
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,440
 so you don't do what seems right to man,

1113
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,420
 but in the end, it leads to death.

1114
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,720
 This is what God's Word says.

1115
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,920
 As he went to young Jeremiah and said,

1116
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,080
 Jeremiah, I'm gonna call you,

1117
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,260
 I'm gonna make you part of my remnant,

1118
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,120
 you're gonna be a prophet,

1119
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,520
 you're gonna bring forth truth because it's loving.

1120
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,080
 Jeremiah was not wild about the idea,

1121
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,080
 but in verse 17 of Jeremiah chapter one, he says,

1122
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,000
 Jeremiah, gird up your loins and arise.

1123
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,760
 You're the remnant.

1124
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,740
 Speak to them all which I command you.

1125
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,620
 Don't be dismayed before them, or I will dismay you.

1126
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:09,440
 Watch, remnant, this is your job.

1127
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,200
 Behold, I have made you today as a fortified city,

1128
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,040
 as a pillar of iron, as walls of bronze

1129
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,160
 against the whole land.

1130
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,520
 I want you to speak to kings,

1131
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,880
 I want you to speak to princesses,

1132
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,360
 I want you to speak to princes who will tell you

1133
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,920
 every kind of crazy thing coming out of American pulpits.

1134
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,400
 I want you to speak to the people

1135
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,700
 'cause you're the remnant.

1136
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:33,800
 The remnant speaks, but the remnant stands

1137
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,240
 when others cannot, and the reason is for verse 19

1138
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,080
 of that same little section where it says this.

1139
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,160
 Listen, you need to know something, remnant,

1140
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,720
 they're gonna fight against you.

1141
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,620
 But they will not overcome you

1142
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,880
 'cause truth is on your side.

1143
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,860
 God plus one is the majority.

1144
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,760
 The game is fixed.

1145
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,720
 Wisdom will vindicate itself by her deeds.

1146
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,680
 They will fight against you.

1147
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,340
 They will not overcome you,

1148
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:02,200
 for I am with you to deliver you, says the Lord.

1149
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,200
 When Jesus was talking to his disciples,

1150
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,920
 you know, he said, listen, I'm gonna send you out

1151
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,800
 as sheep among wolves.

1152
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,160
 Now, I don't know if you know much about sports mascots,

1153
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,380
 okay, but you typically don't call yourself

1154
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,560
 the New York bunnies, right?

1155
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:23,060
 Or you're not the Dallas koala bears, right?

1156
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:27,040
 You're not the St. Louis hamsters.

1157
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,120
 You typically don't take small creatures

1158
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,400
 that are cuddly and warm, right,

1159
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,560
 and make a mascot out of it.

1160
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,160
 So Jesus says, here's the deal, okay, guys,

1161
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,680
 hey, we're gonna be the sheep, all right,

1162
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,060
 and we're gonna be in competition

1163
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,200
 day in and day out against the wolves.

1164
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,140
 Kind of like, hey, can we come up with a different mascot?

1165
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:45,520
 Jesus says, no, you just need to know something, man.

1166
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,680
 You're sheep because you're gonna follow

1167
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,360
 the shepherd's voice, and there are wolves

1168
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,680
 that are out there, and you just need to know something.

1169
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,500
 I'm a good shepherd.

1170
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,680
 I'll give my life for the sheep.

1171
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,760
 I'm not telling you that there aren't gonna be some days

1172
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,080
 that the wolves ravage the sheep.

1173
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,640
 I'm gonna let some of the sheep be led to slaughter,

1174
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,760
 and when they die, they need to die a certain way

1175
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,280
 with a certain confidence so that the wolves

1176
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,800
 start to think, these sheep must know something

1177
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,760
 that we don't know.

1178
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,720
 (laughs)

1179
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,400
 1987, there's a movie that came out,

1180
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,680
 The Princess Bride, you remember that movie?

1181
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,840
 Who doesn't love it?

1182
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,400
 Do you remember that scene when Inigo Montoya

1183
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,280
 and Wesley were in a sword fight, right?

1184
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,440
 I love it because they're sitting there,

1185
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,940
 it all starts with, you know, they're up there,

1186
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,540
 they're fighting, and Inigo says,

1187
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,080
 you're using Benedi's defense on me,

1188
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,320
 and he says, well, of course, it's only fitting

1189
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,640
 given the rocking terrain, and then they go off

1190
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,880
 a little bit more, and eventually Inigo says,

1191
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,080
 you are wonderful, right?

1192
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,780
 Wesley says, thank you, I've worked hard to become so.

1193
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,040
 And then what's Inigo say?

1194
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,640
 He says, I admit it, you are better than I am.

1195
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,040
 And then Wesley says, then why are you smiling?

1196
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,400
 And Inigo says, because I know something

1197
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,240
 you don't know.

1198
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:48,240
 I am not left-handed, right?

1199
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,120
 And then he fires the sword off to the other side,

1200
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,800
 and so they keep fighting, and then after a little bit while

1201
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,640
 Inigo says to the other guy, he says, you're amazing.

1202
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,920
 And he said, I ought to be after 20 years.

1203
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,160
 He said, but there's something I ought to tell you,

1204
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,320
 I'm not left-handed either.

1205
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,520
 It's a great scene, I love it.

1206
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,760
 Why are you smiling?

1207
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,240
 Because hey, this isn't my home, man.

1208
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,440
 And I get it that sometimes wolves eat sheep,

1209
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,640
 but when you devour the sheep, I'm not done.

1210
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,880
 Watch, this is what Jesus told them right after he said,

1211
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,320
 you're gonna be sheep amongst wolves.

1212
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,120
 In Matthew chapter 10, Jesus talking to his disciples,

1213
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,000
 and he says this, starting in verse 24, he says,

1214
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,840
 guys, you need to know something,

1215
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,560
 a disciple's not above his teacher.

1216
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,920
 It's enough for a disciple to become just like his teacher,

1217
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,360
 because a slave like his master, if they've called me

1218
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,760
 the head of the household of the devil,

1219
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,800
 how much more will they malign the members?

1220
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,320
 Therefore, though, don't fear them,

1221
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,120
 for there is nothing that is concealed

1222
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,400
 that will not be revealed or hidden that will not be known.

1223
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,200
 What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light,

1224
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,320
 which you hear whispered in your ear,

1225
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,840
 proclaiming among the housetops.

1226
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,800
 And I can tell you, in this situation,

1227
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,720
 Jesus, I'm sure, is watching his disciples go,

1228
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,840
 this is not gonna be pretty.

1229
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,840
 And I think in this moment, all right,

1230
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,440
 little bit of, I'm gonna stick myself

1231
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,400
 into the story a little bit.

1232
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,880
 I think Jesus went, hey, sheep, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1233
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,920
 don't lose heart.

1234
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,000
 I just told you it's gonna get nasty.

1235
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,800
 But don't fear them.

1236
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,360
 Because I'm gonna tell you something,

1237
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,020
 you don't need to fear the one who's able to kill the body,

1238
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,080
 but not the soul.

1239
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,640
 You'd rather feel the one that's able to destroy both body

1240
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,400
 and who's gonna cast the soul and the body in hell forever.

1241
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,720
 That's me.

1242
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,720
 Don't fear him.

1243
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:33,680
 The remnant stands when nobody else stands.

1244
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:40,520
 One of my favorite stories is of a guy named Hugh Latimore.

1245
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:44,360
 Hugh Latimore was an English farmer, just a young man,

1246
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,760
 but he became part of the remnant.

1247
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,200
 He was a remnant during the time of Henry VIII.

1248
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:54,200
 Henry VIII acted like a spiritual man,

1249
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,240
 wanted to have a relationship with the church,

1250
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,080
 but what Henry VIII wanted was to be his own king

1251
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,880
 and not have God who was his king.

1252
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,760
 And so when Henry retired of his first wife,

1253
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,800
 he wanted a second.

1254
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,880
 And he went through a whole charade

1255
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,640
 to get his first marriage annulled.

1256
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,780
 He bought off priests that were not part of the remnant,

1257
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,840
 but that were wolves in sheep's clothing.

1258
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,720
 And Henry's corruption became legendary,

1259
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,040
 but praise God, there was a remnant

1260
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,760
 in the form of an English farmer that stood up to him.

1261
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,560
 It was a New Year's day that Hugh Latimore

1262
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,640
 was asked to come speak to Henry VIII,

1263
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:34,640
 and his text in Hebrews 13, was this.

1264
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,240
 He said, "Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge."

1265
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:44,200
 And then he taught from Luke chapter three,

1266
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,720
 where he said that when John the Baptist came forth,

1267
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:52,640
 he looked at people that went through a charade of baptism,

1268
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,080
 and he said, "You brood of vipers,

1269
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,160
 "who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

1270
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,320
 "Bear fruit in keeping with repentance."

1271
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,880
 That same John, later, he told Henry VIII,

1272
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,240
 stood before Herod, and he told Herod

1273
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,720
 that his taking his brother's wife to be his own wife

1274
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,480
 was not lawful.

1275
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,480
 It enraged the king.

1276
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,520
 And he demanded that Latimore repent

1277
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,680
 of what he just said in the king's presence.

1278
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,440
 He said, "I'm gonna give you another chance

1279
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,520
 "to stand before me."

1280
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,280
 And when Latimore stood back before Henry VIII,

1281
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,600
 he said this, "Hugh Latimore, does thou know

1282
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,320
 "before whom thou art to speak this day?"

1283
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,560
 He, in a sense, took third person.

1284
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,920
 "I am to speak to the high and mighty monarch,

1285
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,520
 "the king's most excellent majesty,

1286
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,680
 "who can take away thy life if he offends him.

1287
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,080
 "Therefore, Hugh, take heed that thou speak not a word

1288
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,600
 "that might displease the king.

1289
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,560
 "And then consider well, Hugh, that if you do this,

1290
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,600
 "when you come upon this message that you're sent to give,

1291
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,840
 "that the great and mighty God might give you grace,

1292
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,080
 "but this king surely won't give you grace.

1293
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,320
 "The one who beholds your ways presently,

1294
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,720
 "this one who was able to kill you,

1295
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,080
 "but Hugh, you stand and speak with the God

1296
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,380
 "who is able not to destroy the body that that king can,

1297
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,400
 "but cast the soul into hell wants you to do,

1298
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,920
 "and you speak forth true to him."

1299
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,480
 And he did that, the king went crazy.

1300
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,160
 It wasn't long before Hugh Latimore found himself

1301
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,680
 tied to a stake about ready to get burned with his friend.

1302
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,640
 And when he walked to the stake to get burned,

1303
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,720
 Hugh Latimore turned to his friend and he just said this.

1304
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,720
 He said, "Nicholas, take heart, play the man,

1305
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,580
 "because we shall this day light a candle

1306
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,060
 "by God's grace in England,

1307
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,840
 "as I trust shall never be put out."

1308
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:41,120
 And then God's sheep was burned at the stake.

1309
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:45,700
 And it started a revival.

1310
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,820
 And it stiffened the spines of others

1311
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:53,460
 because somebody did what the remnant should do,

1312
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,540
 graciously but boldly.

1313
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:59,860
 Look guys, I don't know where this thing is headed.

1314
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:03,300
 I heard a guy say this one time, he said,

1315
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,840
 "I think I'm gonna probably die in my shame

1316
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,300
 "because I'm gonna be criticized and called intolerant

1317
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:10,400
 "and called old fashioned and out of step with the times.

1318
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,900
 "I think my successor will probably die in chains,

1319
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,660
 "and I think his successor will probably die in flames."

1320
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:21,020
 But mark my word, his successor will pick up the ashes

1321
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:24,940
 and will restore a godly generation.

1322
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:32,500
 The remnant should be humble because it sees things

1323
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,380
 that only God can let them see.

1324
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,740
 The remnant should shine because they live in a way

1325
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,780
 that only people who are associated with a holy God

1326
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,180
 can shine, the way they date, the way they suffer,

1327
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,580
 the way they speak, the way they love.

1328
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:48,100
 The remnant speaks.

1329
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,500
 And the remnant stands firm because it knows

1330
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,180
 that even if they're burned at the stake,

1331
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:57,660
 to die is gain.

1332
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:03,260
 Paul said, "It's better for you if I remain.

1333
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:06,540
 "But if you wanna send me to glory, send me to glory.

1334
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,740
 "But while I'm here, I will live for the glory of my king

1335
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,180
 "who lived and died for me."

1336
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,220
 Can I tell you, I'll just close with this.

1337
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,220
 I buried a friend who was a graduate

1338
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,780
 of the Naval Academy on Friday.

1339
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,480
 And at the end of the wedding,

1340
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,060
 I do that all the time, I call funerals weddings

1341
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:28,540
 because that's exactly what it is for believers.

1342
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:31,260
 It's your homecoming, man, your bridegroom's ready.

1343
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,820
 At the end of the funeral,

1344
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:36,860
 they played a song that I'm about to play for you,

1345
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:39,940
 and there was in that room a bunch of Navy SEALs.

1346
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,940
 A bunch of others that had graduated from the Academy.

1347
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:47,740
 And when the song started, it's the Navy alma mater

1348
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,380
 that if you're a graduate of Annapolis, you sing.

1349
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:54,740
 And they all got up, and there's about 10 of those men

1350
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,540
 that came and stood around the bride.

1351
00:55:56,540 --> 00:56:01,180
 And I remember looking at those guys,

1352
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,180
 and one of my great regrets in life

1353
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:07,300
 is that I didn't, I didn't know what to do.

1354
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,300
 And one of the great regrets in life

1355
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,700
 is that I didn't serve our country

1356
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:16,220
 the way godly and faithful, strong men serve our country,

1357
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,740
 strong women serve our country.

1358
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,140
 I never had that as part of my story.

1359
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,080
 And I remember sitting there longing to be a guy

1360
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,100
 that could have stood up with those Navy SEALs

1361
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,540
 and those midshipmen that had sacrificed by the sea

1362
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:31,380
 to be trained to sail on waters and defeat evil.

1363
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:35,540
 I want you to put yourself back in that funeral for a second

1364
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,460
 and then I close with the last statements.

1365
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,700
 But this song was played,

1366
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,880
 and imagine getting to stand up when it was done.

1367
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,720
 Watch this.

1368
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:46,260
 Something just haunting about the Navy Glee Club

1369
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:47,700
 when they sing that, it just makes you,

1370
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,060
 I saw those men stand behind that widow.

1371
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,180
 And I thought to myself,

1372
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,780
 I serve in a much more noble army than that.

1373
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:59,300
 And as much as I would have wanted

1374
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,100
 to be through some of the tours,

1375
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,780
 to do that those guys were in the Philippines

1376
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:05,180
 and Afghanistan and on all the seas,

1377
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,700
 I thought to myself, nope, right now,

1378
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,700
 I'm part of the remnant, man.

1379
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,460
 I am serving something even more noble than that.

1380
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:16,540
 And when my king at the end of the day is worshiped

1381
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:21,420
 and the alma mater of the remnant is sung, I will stand.

1382
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:24,500
 And by the grace of God, as I walk with him,

1383
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,320
 as a soldier who doesn't entangle himself

1384
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,660
 in the affairs of everyday life

1385
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,980
 in order that I might please the one

1386
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,700
 that enlisted me as a soldier, I will stand.

1387
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,300
 And I will be glad that by the grace of God I have seen,

1388
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,780
 that by the grace of God I served.

1389
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:41,460
 By the grace of God I spoke in a winsome way

1390
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,580
 with my speech seasoned with salt as it was,

1391
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,040
 and I stood firm.

1392
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,540
 And if I die in flames,

1393
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:50,300
 I pray that God will use it to light a candle

1394
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,860
 that the entire world will see.

1395
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:57,220
 There is nothing more noble than being the remnant,

1396
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:00,780
 when the remnant serves the kind and benevolent

1397
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,900
 and true all powerful king.

1398
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:07,300
 This world needs a remnant.

1399
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:13,580
 It is calling cats, dogs, girls, boys, and lies truth.

1400
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:20,540
 And humans do not flourish under lies.

1401
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,300
 If you by the grace of God have come to know the truth,

1402
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,020
 live as if you know the truth.

1403
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:31,860
 Speak gently but courageously before any king.

1404
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,820
 Because you stand firm for yours.

1405
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,780
 Let's go.

1406
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:40,060
 Father, I pray we'd be the remnant.

1407
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,860
 I pray if there's any in here tonight

1408
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:46,860
 that has had a confusing understanding

1409
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,060
 about what it is that you want from us.

1410
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,900
 If they've been confused to think

1411
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,660
 that they've got to serve long and nobly

1412
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:56,340
 in order to possibly be admitted into your family,

1413
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:59,220
 I pray that you would shake them out of that

1414
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:02,660
 and understand that all you do is call broken sinners

1415
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,300
 and just say, "Are you sick and tired of drowning

1416
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,020
 "in the sea of human despair?

1417
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:07,340
 "Then come to me.

1418
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:10,380
 "And I will restore the glory that is lost.

1419
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,100
 "I will make beauty from your ashes.

1420
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,780
 "I'll make you my remnant.

1421
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,940
 "I'll call you out of darkness into my marvelous light.

1422
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,340
 "And I'll make you as a shining star

1423
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,500
 "in the midst of a dark and perverse generation.

1424
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,460
 "I'll put in you a heart of courage.

1425
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,820
 "I'll put in your lips words that are true.

1426
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:28,740
 "I will clothe you in dignity and honor and compassion

1427
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:31,300
 "and kindness and boldness.

1428
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,940
 "I will give you the ability to take heart

1429
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:37,320
 "in the midst of those that seek our life

1430
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,620
 "because you know that this world is not your home."

1431
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:42,300
 Oh, Father, what a privilege

1432
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:45,500
 that grace would enlist us in your family.

1433
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:49,180
 And what a privilege to be shepherded by you as your sheep.

1434
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:55,340
 Would you help us not just to sing songs,

1435
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:58,400
 but to have our heart filled with the spirit of truth,

1436
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,200
 that we might be a remnant indeed

1437
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,100
 for the glory of our King until he comes.

1438
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:05,180
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1439
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,180
 Let's stand together.
