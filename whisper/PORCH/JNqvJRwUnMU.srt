1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,400
 - What's up everybody in the room,

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
 everybody joining us online,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,800
 wherever you are tuning in from,

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,840
 all the different 11 Ports Live locations,

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,680
 we are continuing this series on Ephesians.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,400
 And I am so excited to introduce

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,680
 who will be teaching tonight.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,040
 This is candidly a night that I've been really excited

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,560
 in praying for for a while

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,720
 and thrilled to get you introduced to a friend of ours.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,360
 You may know him and some of you do,

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,480
 but even if you don't,

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,440
 even if you're listening later on the podcast,

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,840
 you're listening at the different 11 locations,

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,640
 your life has been influenced and impacted by him.

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,160
 And I'm gonna welcome him here in a second.

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,920
 The reason I say that and can say that

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,440
 is because he is one of the five elders

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,400
 in leadership at this church.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,800
 In other words, it is directly connected

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,640
 to the leaders that God has here,

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,960
 a few of them who are here,

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,360
 so we can welcome all of them here in a second.

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,800
 And their generosity and belief in what God is doing

26
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,080
 through the lives of young adults in our generation

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,320
 that has enabled us to make Tuesday nights happen

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,960
 and enables us to stream to 11 different locations

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,640
 and a resource and to support.

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,120
 And so will you help me welcome Mickey Friedrich,

31
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,040
 one of our elders who is teaching tonight

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,840
 and walking us through Ephesians chapter five.

33
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,320
 (congregation applauding)

34
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,160
 - Thanks brother.

35
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,640
 Thanks David.

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,240
 All right.

37
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,240
 Well, it really is a joy to be here with y'all tonight.

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,080
 The porch, God has used the porch to stretch

39
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,320
 and disciple me for years.

40
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,040
 And I'm just grateful for the privilege

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,200
 to be with you tonight.

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,360
 And my wife is here as well.

43
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,440
 I'd like to show you a picture of the best part of me

44
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,600
 and that's my family.

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,480
 I've been married to my wife, Jessica, here in a few days.

46
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,360
 It'll be 17 years.

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,600
 And I know there's no way it looks like she's old enough

48
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,440
 to be married that long and I agree.

49
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,600
 But I would just like to thank her

50
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,560
 'cause she was instrumental in getting me to a place

51
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,640
 to be able to share this message.

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,560
 There's some personal things that I'll be sharing

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,040
 and I've walked this journey with her

54
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,640
 and she's a big part of that.

55
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,400
 And then we have four kids.

56
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,840
 We have Goldie who's six, Bay and Knox in the middle

57
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,520
 and then Mila who's 17.

58
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,800
 So we have a lot of fun, a lot of energy in our house.

59
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,520
 Now we're in the middle of a series

60
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,880
 called Introducing the New You.

61
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,640
 And whenever I was eight years old,

62
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,000
 I'll share more of my story later,

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,520
 but whenever I was eight years old,

64
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,320
 I was adopted by a man named Fred Friedrich.

65
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,800
 My mom married him.

66
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,560
 Him and his family adopted me into their family.

67
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,760
 And when you're adopted, many things change.

68
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,120
 And I received a new name.

69
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,240
 We moved to a new town.

70
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,040
 I got new friends,

71
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,160
 but not all of it was an easy transition.

72
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,760
 For one, I had to figure out how to spell this new name.

73
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,560
 My previous name was shorter and I had it from birth

74
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,680
 so it was easier.

75
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,680
 This name, I didn't even know how to say it,

76
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,040
 whether it was Friedrich or Frederick

77
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,760
 and there's still some uncertainty there.

78
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,960
 But I went to class and you know you have to write your name

79
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,400
 on the paper and I, my dad gave me this mnemonic,

80
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,640
 but it's spelled Friedrich.

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,560
 So even now, whenever I tell people,

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,120
 hi, my name's Mickey Friedrich, how do you spell that?

83
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,680
 I try to use Friedrich.

84
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,040
 And I also had to learn

85
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,760
 that there was a different organization at school.

86
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,080
 You see, my first last name was Adler, starts with A.

87
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,040
 My middle name's Aaron, starts with two As.

88
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,520
 And so any line there was in kindergarten,

89
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,480
 first grade, second grade,

90
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,000
 I pretty much got close to the front of the line.

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,920
 But whenever I got the name Friedrich,

92
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,440
 I had to get used to being in the middle of the line

93
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,560
 and I didn't like that.

94
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,920
 So new identities come with a lot of new changes.

95
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,720
 Tonight, we're gonna jump into Ephesians 5

96
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,240
 and in it, we're gonna learn about the new us,

97
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,600
 who we are in Christ, what that looks like.

98
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,320
 And sometimes whenever I read passages like Ephesians 5,

99
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,120
 I can struggle because I hear what my new identity is,

100
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,600
 but sometimes I can feel like a fraud.

101
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,600
 And, you know, I know things like I'm a child of the king,

102
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,260
 I'm beloved, I've been made new,

103
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,680
 but sometimes I can have conflicting feelings.

104
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,080
 And we'll dive into that a little bit tonight.

105
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,820
 But open your Bibles to Ephesians 5

106
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,360
 or read it however you have it, and we'll jump in.

107
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,560
 We're gonna read verses 1 through 14.

108
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,720
 Paul wrote this to the Ephesians and said,

109
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,560
 "Therefore be imitators of God as beloved children

110
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,040
 "and walk in love, as Christ loved us

111
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,840
 "and gave himself up for us,

112
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,000
 "a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.

113
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,500
 "But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness

114
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,360
 "must not even be named among you

115
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
 "as is proper among saints.

116
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,560
 "Let there be no filthiness, nor foolish talk,

117
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,760
 "nor crude joking, which are all out of place.

118
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,340
 "But instead, let there be thanksgiving,

119
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,540
 "for you may be sure of this,

120
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,940
 "that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure

121
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,480
 "or who is covetous, that is an idolater,

122
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,960
 "has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.

123
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,160
 "Let no one deceive you with empty words,

124
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,420
 "for because of these things,

125
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,800
 "the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.

126
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,560
 "Therefore do not become partners with them,

127
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,760
 "for at one time you were darkness,

128
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,660
 "but now you are light in the Lord.

129
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,640
 "Walk as children of light,

130
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,960
 "for the fruit of light is found

131
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,560
 "in all that is good and right and true.

132
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,160
 "And try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.

133
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,360
 "Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness,

134
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,080
 "but instead expose them.

135
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,360
 "For it is shameful even to speak

136
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
 "of the things that they do in secret.

137
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,340
 "But when anything is exposed by the light,

138
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,840
 "it becomes visible,

139
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,340
 "for anything that becomes visible is light.

140
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,980
 "Therefore it says, awake, O sleeper,

141
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,180
 "and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."

142
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,640
 Lord, just please help us to understand your word.

143
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,160
 Help us to hear your spirit as you speak to us tonight.

144
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,680
 And just please guide us through this time tonight.

145
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,780
 Thank you for your love, amen.

146
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,440
 So, how do these words make you feel?

147
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,320
 Those are quite a few verses, a lot of different things.

148
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,980
 What do you feel when you hear words like that?

149
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,640
 You see, like I mentioned,

150
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,080
 I can have some conflicting emotions

151
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,800
 whenever I read verses like this.

152
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,680
 You know, I read verse one where it says,

153
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,000
 "Hey, be imitators of God's beloved children."

154
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,960
 I see some things to do there,

155
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,280
 and walk in love as Christ gave himself up for us.

156
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,180
 But then we get to verses like verse three,

157
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,400
 and I read it, and it says,

158
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,140
 "But sexual immorality and impurity,

159
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,060
 "or covetousness, must not even be named among you."

160
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,200
 Well, here's the problem.

161
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,360
 That, along with filthiness, foolish talk, crude joking,

162
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,320
 that's who I was.

163
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,600
 I know that.

164
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,760
 I have a new identity.

165
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,000
 But what if I feel like that's who I still am?

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,820
 You know, I know what I'm supposed to feel.

167
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,820
 I know my identity is as a beloved child of God.

168
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,460
 But what if I'm still feeling or drawn to

169
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,440
 those very words that Paul's listing in verses three and four?

170
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,640
 And I don't think I'm alone

171
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,160
 in feeling these conflicting feelings.

172
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,000
 You know, we can know who we're supposed to be,

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,880
 and then we can wake up in the morning and realize,

174
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,180
 we just did that again.

175
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,480
 Whether it was crossing boundaries

176
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,600
 with our boyfriend or girlfriend,

177
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,240
 whether it was giving in to porn in the middle of the night

178
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,280
 for all the reasons that made sense to us that night,

179
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,640
 but then in the morning,

180
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,360
 we just realize, wow, I made that choice again.

181
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,500
 We said we'd never go back to those things,

182
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,400
 those images, those habits, those people,

183
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,360
 and yet we do it again.

184
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,600
 And so we read a verse like this,

185
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,600
 all sexual immorality, all impurity, all covetousness,

186
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,200
 and we could just hear the Spirit speaking to us.

187
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,600
 And then we go to the next verses.

188
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,640
 It just says the sexually immoral, the impure,

189
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,680
 the covetousness, the idolater,

190
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,680
 they have no inheritance in the kingdom of God and of Christ.

191
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,000
 And then I can start to think,

192
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,460
 hey, do I really even fit in with the people of God?

193
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,460
 I mean, I fear rejection.

194
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,060
 I feel like I could be rejected.

195
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,020
 I'm doing the very things that God's saying

196
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,140
 could cause me to have no inheritance.

197
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,340
 Now, we know once we're saved,

198
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,700
 once we surrender to Jesus Christ,

199
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,000
 that we're his child and we're his child forever,

200
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 but raises a lot of questions and confusing emotions.

201
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,540
 And here's the other thing.

202
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,560
 We can focus on the things that we're doing now,

203
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,140
 the reality that we're living in now,

204
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,160
 but there's a whole lot of years

205
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,280
 lived in each one of our pasts

206
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,120
 that can also bring up feelings

207
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,480
 and conflicting emotions in that moment.

208
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,920
 You see, many of us were abused growing up.

209
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,440
 Things happened to us, it wasn't what we did,

210
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,360
 but it was what we've had to carry with us.

211
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,760
 And that can bring up conflicting emotions and feelings.

212
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,840
 We can wonder, is it our fault?

213
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,940
 And then maybe we acted out at different periods

214
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,820
 in our past and we just don't have categories for that.

215
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,900
 We don't know how to process it.

216
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,500
 We don't know how that identity fits with this identity

217
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,620
 'cause it still feels like there's something there.

218
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,780
 We can ask each other, we can ask ourselves questions.

219
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,020
 Was I an abuser?

220
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,980
 Am I gay?

221
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:59,420
 I still feel like an addict?

222
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,020
 Those feelings are there sometimes

223
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,500
 and we have to process them.

224
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,480
 And then we go on to verse eight where it says,

225
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,120
 "At one time you were darkness."

226
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,520
 So often, I can still feel that darkness inside of me.

227
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,000
 And then it says, "Take no part

228
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,920
 "in the unfruitful works of darkness."

229
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,840
 But what about those free passes we keep giving ourselves?

230
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,220
 What about that sin that we're continuing to coddle,

231
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,280
 that sin that we're continuing to hide,

232
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,480
 giving ourselves free pass after free pass?

233
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,920
 What about where it says, "Take no part"?

234
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,640
 What about in verse 12 where it says, "It is shameful

235
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,080
 "even to speak of the things they do in secret."

236
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,020
 Even to speak of the things

237
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,920
 that I still want to do in secret, it is shameful.

238
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,400
 I think we know that feeling well.

239
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:57,240
 You see, it's really important what we do

240
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,560
 when we feel like a fraud.

241
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,120
 And it's a reality for many, many believers.

242
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,400
 Even after we've known Jesus,

243
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,200
 been walking with him for a while.

244
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,960
 And there's different things that we can revert back to,

245
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,160
 and I'm speaking about my own experience here.

246
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,520
 See, the first thing that I want to do

247
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,520
 is just fake it 'til I make it.

248
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,600
 Hey, I see the standards that God has laid out

249
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,080
 in verses like first part of Ephesians five,

250
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,040
 and I just try to make my life look like that

251
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,500
 to everybody on the outside.

252
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,000
 I just want to fake it until I make it,

253
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,800
 and then hopefully Jesus will save me through some miracle

254
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,620
 and continue to transform me.

255
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,160
 But the problem is that doesn't work.

256
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,980
 And so what do we do then?

257
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,160
 We try harder, and that doesn't work.

258
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,000
 So what do we do then?

259
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,960
 We try harder.

260
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,080
 And where does that leave us?

261
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,680
 That leaves us right back where we started.

262
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,080
 Even more shamed, even more convinced

263
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,880
 that we're an outsider, we're unworthy.

264
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,080
 We really don't get what we claim to get

265
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,880
 about our new identity in Christ.

266
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,120
 So what do we do then?

267
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,040
 We deny our feelings.

268
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,520
 We deny God's standards.

269
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,080
 We deny the need to do anything but just conform.

270
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,020
 Hey, if I can just get the outside to look right,

271
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,540
 then I've got time for the inside.

272
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,860
 We can also run.

273
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,380
 We can run from anything that reminds us

274
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,580
 of who we really are.

275
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,860
 We can run to the things that help us forget.

276
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,900
 We can run from relationships.

277
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,580
 I talked to quite a few of you that you get,

278
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,140
 you meet the woman, you meet the man,

279
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,620
 it's great, it's going forward,

280
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,060
 and then you just get to a certain level of intimacy,

281
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,620
 and you just run.

282
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,460
 You don't want to be known

283
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,640
 because if you become known, then they may reject you.

284
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,680
 So it's easier just to push them away

285
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,920
 and not have to deal with that possible rejection.

286
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,240
 We can fear intimacy.

287
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,120
 We can be hesitant to trust

288
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,040
 because of how we've been wounded in the past

289
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,000
 because life hasn't always been a safe place.

290
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,760
 We can excuse.

291
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,400
 We can compare ourselves to others

292
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,400
 who are doing worse stuff than we really want to do.

293
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,840
 Hey, we can excuse ourselves

294
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,800
 and go to a different body of believers

295
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,220
 that aren't going to raise such high standards

296
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,360
 of God's word and call us to faithfulness

297
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,740
 in the way that we do in places like this.

298
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,240
 And then finally, we can cope.

299
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,580
 We can do anything but face the reality

300
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,660
 that's in front of us.

301
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,060
 We can numb out on social media.

302
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,260
 We can eat, run to releases,

303
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,020
 seemingly releases like porn, like work,

304
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,580
 like unhealthy relationships.

305
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,900
 You see, there's more going on underneath the surface

306
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,620
 than we can ever imagine inside of us.

307
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,520
 And it matters more than we ever imagined.

308
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,080
 And if we ignore it, we forfeit the wholeness

309
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,660
 that is available to us in Christ.

310
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,020
 We don't have to stay here.

311
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:45,020
 And here's the thing, I am a beloved child of God,

312
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,980
 Ephesians 5.1.

313
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,960
 And no matter what, if we've surrendered to Jesus,

314
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,240
 that's the reality of who we are.

315
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,940
 And here for a moment,

316
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,020
 I'd like to share just a little bit of my story with you,

317
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,540
 to share my journey that's still going on.

318
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,640
 So as we mentioned, my name's Mickey.

319
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,620
 My middle name's Aaron.

320
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,740
 My dad was a baseball coach.

321
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,180
 And he named me after two baseball players,

322
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,580
 Mickey Mantle and Hank Aaron.

323
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,220
 And we did a lot of stuff together

324
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,520
 growing up in the early years,

325
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,420
 spent a lot of time on the team bus at games,

326
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,080
 chopping firewood out at the farm with him and my grandpa.

327
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,220
 And then I came home from kindergarten one day,

328
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,300
 I walked up to the backyard or to my front yard,

329
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,500
 had my backpack on and it was after school.

330
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,260
 And I saw my dad had the red trailer

331
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,780
 that we always use to chop firewood and stack it in.

332
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,660
 He had it filled up with his stuff

333
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,140
 and it was attached to the back of his blazer.

334
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,020
 I said, "Man, what's going on, dad?"

335
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,220
 He said, "Mickey, I've just got to leave."

336
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,780
 And he did.

337
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,420
 It turns out he wasn't faithful to my mother.

338
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,740
 It turns out he probably hadn't been for a while.

339
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,140
 And he decided that the life that he wanted to live

340
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,540
 involved another woman.

341
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,120
 And so he left my mother, he left me at the age of six,

342
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,900
 he left my baby sister who was six weeks old.

343
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,540
 And he married this other woman and started a new life.

344
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,960
 And so at this point, I got to feel abandonment.

345
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,620
 I still had my mom, she's awesome.

346
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,100
 But I felt that abandonment.

347
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,460
 This man who had what I felt like was a deep relationship

348
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,100
 and just exit my life.

349
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,360
 Now I would still see him on the weekends once in a while

350
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,580
 and I would go spend time with him and his new family.

351
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,620
 And the thing was, the woman he married

352
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,460
 wasn't really a big fan of me.

353
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,360
 And so she had two sons as well.

354
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,460
 They were older, older stepbrothers of mine.

355
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,220
 And so whenever I was over there, I would see things,

356
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,700
 I would have a concern, I would have a need.

357
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,060
 And it just felt like everything

358
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,540
 always got thrown back on me.

359
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,620
 It was always my fault.

360
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,660
 Even when her sons did something, it was always my fault.

361
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,140
 And so I got to start to feel a deep sense of rejection.

362
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,940
 It wasn't a safe place.

363
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,880
 Every time I was over there, I just wanted to leave.

364
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,180
 It was not a safe place.

365
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,340
 And then those two older brothers,

366
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,140
 I'm sure they were going through their stuff too,

367
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,460
 but they liked to beat up on me a little bit.

368
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,340
 So whether it was just playing games around

369
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,060
 or doing different things, it just felt like

370
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,700
 I always ended up with the bruises and the tears.

371
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,840
 And it resulted in different times

372
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,300
 of what I would call physical abuse.

373
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,340
 One example is we were out playing football in the snow

374
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,980
 and we were a ways away from the house

375
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,020
 and I was six or seven and I was wearing jeans

376
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,500
 and the jeans got all wet.

377
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,300
 And they decided like the most fun we could have

378
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
 was for one of them to hold me down

379
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,180
 and another one just take sticks and just thrash my legs.

380
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,620
 And those of y'all that have been hit with wet jeans on,

381
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,340
 know it's not very much fun.

382
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,140
 I healed from that, but you know what didn't heal?

383
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,620
 Was that deep sense of powerlessness

384
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,040
 that comes from being held down and beaten like that.

385
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,460
 What didn't heal was the rage inside of knowing

386
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,220
 I may be little, but I matter.

387
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,700
 That rage of having pain that I didn't know what to do with.

388
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,660
 And here's what else happened during those years.

389
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,340
 Sometime during those years,

390
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,980
 I was sexually abused by two older family members.

391
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,340
 One, a man, one, a woman.

392
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,300
 And what that did is it opened doors

393
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,540
 that shouldn't have been opened that early.

394
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,660
 It exposed me to things

395
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,560
 that I shouldn't have been exposed to.

396
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:31,500
 And I received a deep sense of being damaged.

397
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,420
 I didn't know what through the rest of elementary,

398
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,140
 I didn't know what to do with those feelings

399
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,020
 that had been awoken.

400
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,380
 I didn't know what to do

401
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,280
 just with the fact that this happened.

402
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,860
 And when we pick up things like that at an early age,

403
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,000
 they stick with us.

404
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,360
 And then one day at the age of eight,

405
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,140
 a man named Fred walked into our lives.

406
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,540
 You know, the season wasn't bad.

407
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,820
 It wasn't even largely bad.

408
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,220
 See, I got to see my mom's face through all of those years,

409
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,760
 how she would play the piano.

410
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,120
 She would sing praises to God.

411
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,860
 She would remind me of what's true.

412
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,380
 She sacrificed for me and my sister.

413
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,820
 She went back to school to finish her college degree.

414
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,300
 I got to see the deep, enduring love of my mom.

415
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,660
 And then she married Fred whenever I was eight.

416
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,200
 Him and his parents adopted me and my sister

417
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,120
 into their family.

418
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,020
 I got to experience what adoption was,

419
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,180
 where I got to experience things

420
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,580
 that I didn't even have words for back then,

421
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,220
 but unconditional love, unmerited favor.

422
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,740
 They said, "Mickey, you are a Friedrich

423
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,620
 "as if you were a Friedrich

424
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,460
 "whenever you came out of the womb at the delivery room."

425
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,380
 For the rest of my life,

426
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,060
 I've gotten to enjoy life as a Friedrich,

427
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,880
 fully loved by them in ways that I can't even describe.

428
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:54,580
 I also got to experience being invested in.

429
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,300
 You see, Fred started teaching me

430
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,140
 what it meant to be a man.

431
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,380
 He taught me what it was like to work hard,

432
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,780
 what it was like to have integrity,

433
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,340
 how to treat people right,

434
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,460
 how to deal with life when we mess up.

435
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,320
 I learned that I was worth investing in,

436
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,840
 and it mattered.

437
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:22,020
 Had about six good years, great years.

438
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,460
 And then one night, my dad, Fred,

439
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,980
 was a football coach, wrestling coach, all that stuff.

440
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,740
 We got back from a football game one night in December,

441
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,540
 and it was about midnight.

442
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,660
 Him and my mom were in the living room.

443
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,260
 I was in my room reading,

444
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,460
 and I just heard my mom shriek.

445
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,940
 And I ran in the living room,

446
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,140
 and Fred, my father, was having a massive heart attack

447
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,420
 right there on the couch.

448
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,260
 So we pull him down into the floor.

449
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,340
 We call 911.

450
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,360
 We get the cops coming,

451
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,300
 and my dad died in my arms that night on the floor.

452
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,940
 You see, they took him to the hospital,

453
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,140
 couldn't bring him back.

454
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:04,860
 So just first, just abandonment right there.

455
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,700
 Happened again.

456
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,820
 A lot to process.

457
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,620
 But that wasn't it.

458
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,980
 You see, I'm an Eagle Scout,

459
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,900
 and the reason I'm an Eagle Scout

460
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,780
 is because Fred was an Eagle Scout.

461
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,320
 And that was one of the big things that we did together.

462
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,520
 We spent so much time together in the woods,

463
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,820
 learning all this stuff.

464
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,580
 I was trained to do CPR.

465
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,260
 But when he needed me most,

466
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,760
 right there in my arms on the floor, I froze.

467
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,520
 I was in shock.

468
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,700
 I couldn't move.

469
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,560
 I was freaked out by what the body does

470
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,020
 whenever it starts to shut down.

471
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,160
 And I could not bring myself to do CPR.

472
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,360
 And I failed it.

473
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,640
 And I had to carry that.

474
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,200
 I didn't invite others into it.

475
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
 But what I did do

476
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:06,640
 is I entered into a deep season of rebellion.

477
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,320
 You see, I was saved at the age of six.

478
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,480
 I came forward with what I believe is the faith of a child.

479
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,720
 Saw some friends getting baptized,

480
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,500
 came down, asked questions, talked with a pastor.

481
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,400
 I gave the right answers, accepted Jesus, I was baptized.

482
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:27,520
 But a lot of my childhood, I kind of spent in neutral.

483
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,880
 Had some times when I was running after Jesus.

484
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,600
 But most of the time, I was in neutral.

485
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,860
 And from this point forward, I lived mostly in rebellion.

486
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,220
 And from that time forward, I just remember,

487
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,100
 I'll give you some words

488
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,940
 that kind of describe that time in my life.

489
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,940
 Rebellion, guilt, anger, insecurity, shame,

490
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:54,780
 pride, fear, coping.

491
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,680
 So this is most of high school and most of college.

492
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:05,020
 It resulted in substance abuse, improper relationships,

493
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,340
 a lot of fighting.

494
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,300
 Whenever I just had emotions I couldn't handle,

495
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,900
 I didn't know what they were, I would just lash out.

496
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,940
 And then when I went to college,

497
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,740
 I did things like played rugby, rodeo.

498
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,100
 Put me in a lot of scenarios

499
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,660
 where I was just able to just continue to pursue the flesh

500
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,580
 and respond in these destructive ways.

501
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,700
 I was at a bar.

502
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,220
 So often, they asked me to work there,

503
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,380
 started bouncing at a bar.

504
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,140
 In my life, I was running towards everything

505
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,940
 that I thought was gonna bring life, relief,

506
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,260
 anything that could do all the things

507
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,340
 that I described before, deny, cope, run from,

508
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,780
 anything that was gonna make that pain more real,

509
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,280
 run towards everything that was gonna deaden that pain.

510
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,440
 All I got was more pain.

511
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,780
 All I got was more destruction in my life

512
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,220
 and in the lives of anybody that was close to me.

513
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,940
 And continued to approach death.

514
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,620
 You see, I started waking up in the morning

515
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,260
 and just thinking, oh my goodness,

516
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,260
 how am I waking up right now?

517
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,820
 There's no way I should have lived through

518
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,320
 what just happened last night.

519
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,320
 Or I would wake up and have to go pick my friends up

520
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,900
 out of jail or see the consequences

521
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,140
 that were showing up in their life.

522
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,680
 And all through this time, I felt the call of the Spirit.

523
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,340
 That's why I do believe I was saved at the age of six,

524
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,820
 'cause I was never free from the conviction

525
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,620
 of the Holy Spirit during this time.

526
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,660
 And I got to the spring of 2002.

527
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,940
 I was a senior in college, my fourth year.

528
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,460
 It took me five years because I was an idiot in college.

529
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:41,460
 But the spring of 2002, I just got so desperate.

530
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,020
 I felt the Spirit telling me,

531
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,740
 like for some reason I've been protecting you, Mickey,

532
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,440
 from the consequences of your decisions and your rebellion.

533
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,340
 But there's no guarantee that protection's gonna continue.

534
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,580
 And I just had the fear of God fall on my heart.

535
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,840
 I was desperate.

536
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,880
 I was living out what I know now is Proverbs 14, 12,

537
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,920
 that says, "There is a way that seems right to man,

538
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,960
 "but its end is the way to death."

539
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,560
 And so there I am, spring of 2002.

540
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,400
 I was drunk.

541
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,240
 I was in my room.

542
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,880
 I remember looking in the mirror in my bathroom,

543
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,440
 just knowing this is real.

544
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,220
 And I felt the Spirit just calling me.

545
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,920
 I felt the Spirit say, "Mickey, come home.

546
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,920
 "Mickey, open up my word."

547
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,680
 You see, that was a problem

548
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,760
 because in my rebellion, I had found reasons

549
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,720
 to not even believe that the Bible was true.

550
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,040
 For one, I read the Old Testament

551
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,560
 and there's men being affirmed, seemingly being affirmed,

552
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,600
 for all the things that I was being told I couldn't do.

553
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,460
 David, Abraham, all these guys that had relationships.

554
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,000
 They didn't even kill somebody,

555
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,640
 and yet he's a man after God's own heart.

556
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,360
 So many questions that I couldn't answer.

557
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,800
 And here's the thing, whenever I had questions,

558
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,640
 I thought that it was just

559
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,200
 'cause I didn't have enough faith.

560
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,920
 I didn't know there was anything like apologetics.

561
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,880
 I didn't know we all have those questions at times.

562
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,640
 I couldn't explain creation.

563
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,480
 There were just so many.

564
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,600
 So I had come to this place where I just said,

565
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,700
 "God, I just can't believe your word.

566
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,540
 "It's not true.

567
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,360
 "I'm not opening it."

568
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,880
 And I heard the, I didn't hear, I felt the Spirit

569
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,320
 just kind of saying like, "Yeah, I know, I know.

570
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,960
 "Just open, just open my word one more time."

571
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,200
 And so I did.

572
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,220
 I opened it up, started reading it in Genesis.

573
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,900
 Read through Exodus, a couple other books.

574
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,100
 Got to the boring parts of the Old Testament.

575
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,100
 Jumped to the New Testament,

576
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,060
 started reading in the Gospels.

577
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,440
 And at some point, I just started reading

578
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,580
 with eyes of faith.

579
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,220
 I still couldn't answer my questions.

580
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,900
 I still couldn't even say why I had faith,

581
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,720
 why I believed this book.

582
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,460
 But the Spirit just met me there.

583
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,180
 I knew without a doubt that Jesus lives,

584
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,020
 that he's my Savior.

585
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,220
 He died for me, and there was a life

586
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,260
 that I wasn't experiencing, but I could.

587
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,420
 And from that night, from that season,

588
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,420
 Jesus has had me on a trajectory towards him.

589
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,260
 It's 20 years now.

590
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,340
 I just celebrated 20-year anniversary

591
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,340
 this last spring of that transition.

592
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,400
 And it hasn't been perfect.

593
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,560
 It hasn't always been pretty, but the Spirit keeps calling.

594
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,020
 But even after that evening in 2002,

595
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,560
 you see, God did miraculous things in my life that night.

596
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,900
 Out of those words that I described earlier,

597
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,980
 that rebellion was gone.

598
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,540
 That guilt, Jesus reminded me

599
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,440
 that there is no condemnation

600
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,680
 for those who are in Christ Jesus,

601
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,380
 reminded me that that guilt was gone.

602
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,600
 But everything else was still right there.

603
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,560
 The anger, the insecurity, the shame,

604
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,360
 the pride, the fear, the coping.

605
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,540
 I mean, I was living right in the middle

606
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,860
 of what we were looking at in Ephesians 5.

607
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,520
 All of those words.

608
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,920
 Jesus had delivered me, but it still felt like I was there.

609
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,820
 And that brought up all of those other emotions.

610
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:17,320
 Sexual immorality, impurity, covetousness, filthiness,

611
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,080
 impure, darkness, shameful.

612
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,120
 See, I still felt like a fraud.

613
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,680
 There was a difference between what I should feel

614
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,240
 and what I did feel.

615
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,920
 There were questions I still didn't have answers for.

616
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,300
 There was pain that I couldn't stop.

617
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,580
 There was shame.

618
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,040
 It felt like a constant drip of poison.

619
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,840
 You know, and here's another thing, too.

620
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,540
 I knew my way was broken, my way of rebellion,

621
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,320
 the fighting, the anger, all the destructive behavior,

622
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,440
 but I didn't know what a man looked like.

623
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,560
 I really didn't know.

624
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,060
 I didn't know what a man of God looked like.

625
00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:00,540
 So I just had to take my best shot.

626
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:04,100
 And so I settled at a persona of something like Mr. Rogers.

627
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,240
 Not exactly, I do like sweaters,

628
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,400
 but not exactly like Mr. Rogers,

629
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:15,400
 but this weak, pacified, emasculated vision of a man.

630
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,340
 'Cause I didn't know what to do with all of those emotions.

631
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,660
 I just didn't want to bring any more destruction

632
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,660
 into my life.

633
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:25,100
 And to tell you the truth, that's how I entered marriage.

634
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,980
 Passive, weak, what I view as weak.

635
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,300
 I wouldn't recommend that.

636
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,200
 Makes the journey a little bit harder.

637
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,500
 But then God continued to draw me towards him.

638
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,280
 My wife and I moved to Houston from small town, Oklahoma.

639
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,880
 We moved to Houston, joined a church,

640
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,780
 and they had this thing at the church,

641
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,820
 men's group called Men's Fraternity.

642
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,140
 And I was a man, so I might as well jump in.

643
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,020
 And a man named Robert Lewis started this years ago.

644
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,600
 And what he does walking through this mentorship,

645
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,100
 this discipleship curriculum,

646
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,900
 is he starts to talk about things like father wounds.

647
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,220
 He goes back and has us unpack things

648
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,040
 that happened to us in our past,

649
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,060
 gives us categories for them, helps us process them.

650
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,740
 And that was all brand new to me.

651
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,360
 I was carrying the guilt and the shame

652
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,520
 for everything that happened to me as if it was my fault,

653
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,700
 as if that's who I still was.

654
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,460
 And God, back in like 2006, 2007,

655
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,540
 just started to kind of open my eyes a little bit

656
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,900
 to show me there's a life out there

657
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,380
 that's different than the life that you've experienced.

658
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,180
 And then Jessica and I came to Watermark in 2009,

659
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,340
 and that's where the pace really picked up,

660
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,220
 where I got to see men who have been leading this church,

661
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,080
 men and women who have been helping lead here at the porch,

662
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,820
 just be vulnerable, share their journey,

663
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,460
 show what it looks like to be a man of God,

664
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,980
 show what it looks like to be a husband of God,

665
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,340
 show what it looks like to be a businessman for God,

666
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,180
 and how to be whole,

667
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,840
 and how Jesus transforms us to make us whole.

668
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,500
 And that journey continues.

669
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,280
 So here's three things that I just kind of

670
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,620
 learned along the way

671
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,340
 and continue to have to remind myself of daily.

672
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,940
 One, we're all still in process.

673
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,840
 If we've surrendered to Jesus, we've been justified,

674
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,780
 we are being sanctified, but the key there is our.

675
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,620
 We are still in process.

676
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,320
 Two, the grace of God shines most brightly

677
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,620
 in the middle of our mess.

678
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:31,300
 And then three, so important that we don't,

679
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,840
 let what we can't explain

680
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,280
 negate what we absolutely know to be true.

681
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,980
 So what do we know to be true?

682
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,520
 Let's go back to God's word.

683
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,760
 Right there in the middle of all of the red,

684
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,700
 of all of the verses is verse eight.

685
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,720
 For at one time you were darkness,

686
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,020
 but now you are light in the Lord.

687
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,960
 Walk as children of light.

688
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,320
 See, this is where we get back to walking in the reality

689
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,380
 of the new us.

690
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,440
 All that stuff is still real, it's still going on,

691
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,200
 but we see the truth of God

692
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,800
 right there in the middle of those verses.

693
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,560
 The challenge is we have a spiritual reality

694
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,000
 and an experiential reality.

695
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,880
 The spiritual reality is what I just talked about.

696
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,760
 We're justified, we're being sanctified,

697
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,520
 we will be glorified, and that's true.

698
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,880
 We also have an experiential reality

699
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,060
 where we must process our trauma and our sin.

700
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,520
 We need to allow Jesus to transform,

701
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,400
 to allow us to be whole, to be free

702
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,480
 in the life that he has for us.

703
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,480
 And so this word trauma, people weaponize it and misuse it,

704
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,340
 but it's real.

705
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,040
 And what trauma is, it's anything in our lives

706
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,560
 that we can experience that can result

707
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,600
 in physical or emotional harm.

708
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:55,840
 Trauma often involves sin, sin in us or sin in others,

709
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,000
 but not always.

710
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,120
 For example, my father dying, that just happened.

711
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,480
 Trauma can result from physical, sexual, emotional abuse,

712
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,280
 from abandonment, from rejection, and other things,

713
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,380
 but it's real.

714
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,800
 And the effects of trauma don't usually go away

715
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,640
 on their own.

716
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:23,060
 And the roots of trauma run deeper than we can ever imagine.

717
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:27,120
 You see, I'm reading a book called "The Body Keeps the Score"

718
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,480
 and there's just two sentences here,

719
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,240
 just talks about the challenge of trauma

720
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,160
 and it relates to my journey.

721
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,160
 It says, "The result of trauma and abuse can be confusion

722
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,260
 "about whether one was a victim or a willing participant,

723
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:44,840
 "which in turn leads to bewilderment about the difference

724
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:49,840
 "between love and terror, pain and pleasure."

725
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:58,200
 And the only way to escape trauma and sin

726
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,800
 is to process the trauma.

727
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,160
 And the sin.

728
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,880
 And there's three steps to doing that.

729
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,720
 First, we've gotta be honest with ourselves.

730
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,920
 We need to acknowledge what's happened to us.

731
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,880
 We need to acknowledge what's happened through us.

732
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,660
 Gotta be honest with ourselves.

733
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,480
 We gotta be honest with God and with others.

734
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,560
 God knows it anyways.

735
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,160
 I don't know why it's so hard to be honest with God.

736
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,400
 God knows it all.

737
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,080
 We have to start being honest with ourselves,

738
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,480
 honest with God and others.

739
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,720
 And then third, we've gotta accept God's honesty

740
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,320
 'cause he's been honest with us.

741
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,440
 Start with the first point, honest with self.

742
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,820
 Gotta be honest with who we are really.

743
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,040
 And God doesn't leave us hanging.

744
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,340
 He tells us it right here.

745
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:07,200
 And Ephesians 5, one, "As beloved children."

746
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,400
 If we surrender to Jesus, that's who we are.

747
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,920
 That's not something we earn.

748
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,520
 That's not something we keep.

749
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,540
 That's who we are.

750
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,780
 We can't change that.

751
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,340
 But here's the thing.

752
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,660
 There are thieves in the world.

753
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,200
 And Jesus told us about that

754
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,580
 as he was revealing things about himself in John 10.

755
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,220
 Verses 10 and 11, Jesus said,

756
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:39,020
 "The thief comes only to steal, kill, and destroy.

757
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:43,180
 "But I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.

758
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,740
 "I am the good shepherd.

759
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,640
 "The good shepherd lays his life down for the sheep."

760
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,540
 See, here's the thing.

761
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,540
 We live amongst thieves.

762
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,880
 And I know you've experienced that as well.

763
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,940
 But here's the other thing.

764
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,480
 We are the thieves.

765
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,000
 We are the thieves.

766
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,040
 You see, we each bring sin

767
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,560
 into what started out as God's perfect creation.

768
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,160
 We suffer from the effects of sin.

769
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,800
 Sin in ourselves, sin in others.

770
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,840
 And Jesus sees us, he knows it all.

771
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,940
 And as he sees us, how does he view us?

772
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,520
 He sees us as his sheep, his sheep,

773
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:39,160
 his beloved children that we read about in Ephesians 5.

774
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,060
 He sees us and he did not abandon us.

775
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:48,680
 Jesus is the good shepherd who rescued us

776
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,240
 and is rescuing us because we're his beloved child.

777
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,960
 You are his beloved child.

778
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,640
 That trumps any feeling, thought,

779
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,900
 or emotion that you have right now,

780
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,660
 'cause that is truth.

781
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:10,760
 Jesus is the good shepherd who laid down his life for you.

782
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,220
 We see it here in John 10, we see it in Ephesians 5.2.

783
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:20,480
 Jesus gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering.

784
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,520
 Gotta be honest with ourselves about who we are.

785
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,800
 We have to be honest with God.

786
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,260
 We have to confess our sin.

787
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,200
 James 5.16 says, "Therefore confess your sins

788
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,260
 "to one another and pray for one another

789
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,140
 "that you may be healed."

790
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,720
 The prayer of a righteous person

791
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,080
 has great power as it's working.

792
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,040
 We gotta be honest with God about who we are,

793
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,560
 what we've done, what we're struggling with,

794
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,680
 and that we still need help,

795
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,320
 and God's given us one another

796
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,960
 to walk with each other through that.

797
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,600
 We also need to share our deepest struggles with God.

798
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
 'Cause here's the other reality,

799
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,560
 it's not, it's not pretty.

800
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,500
 We need to be able to share things with God like,

801
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,800
 all right God, I'm struggling with this.

802
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,560
 If you're all powerful, creator, all that,

803
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,520
 and you're all good,

804
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:16,760
 then where were you when I was six,

805
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,360
 when I was eight, when I was 15?

806
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,440
 Where were you, God?

807
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,320
 If you love me as much as you say you do,

808
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,880
 why did I have to experience so much pain

809
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,360
 from myself and from others?

810
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:38,920
 You see, the thing is, God's big enough to handle it,

811
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:45,360
 and God will reveal what you need in his timing,

812
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,260
 but you've gotta be honest with God about that struggle,

813
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,260
 invite him in.

814
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,040
 So where was God?

815
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,720
 Well, this is where we get to point three,

816
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,280
 we have to accept God's honesty with us.

817
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,520
 We'll go back to John 10, a little bit further down,

818
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,800
 verses 27 through 29, where Jesus says,

819
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,480
 "My sheep, they hear my voice,

820
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,240
 "and I know them, and they follow me.

821
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,940
 "I give them eternal life, and they will never perish,

822
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,200
 "and no one will snatch them out of my hand."

823
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,200
 My father who has given them to me is greater than all,

824
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,160
 and no one is able to snatch them out of the father's hand.

825
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:38,520
 So where was Jesus when we were suffering trauma,

826
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,400
 sin, and pain?

827
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,280
 He was right there with us, through it all.

828
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,820
 He's right here with you right now, he has you.

829
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,840
 Paul clings to this truth in Romans eight,

830
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,340
 where he says, "For I am sure that neither death,

831
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,740
 "nor life, nor angels, nor rulers,

832
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,340
 "nor things present, nor things to come,

833
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,600
 "nor powers, nor height, nor depth,

834
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,520
 "nor anything else in all creation

835
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,300
 "will be able to separate us from the love of God

836
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,460
 "that is in Christ Jesus, our Lord."

837
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:20,740
 The thief comes in to steal, kill, and destroy,

838
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,120
 but God keeps us, God calls us,

839
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:28,980
 in the midst of the trauma, and the pain, and the sin.

840
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,940
 After the trauma, the sin, and the pain,

841
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,180
 God keeps us.

842
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,860
 Jesus is the good shepherd.

843
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:43,000
 Jesus is big enough to help us process our sin,

844
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,880
 to bring our hidden shame to the light,

845
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,380
 to resurrect our lives from the dead,

846
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,100
 to help us be fully honest about who we are without him.

847
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,120
 And he reminds us that we're never without him.

848
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,660
 If Jesus is your Lord, then you're his beloved child.

849
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:05,980
 And this is my role here tonight,

850
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:10,040
 is first just to remind you of your new identity.

851
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,340
 Let me remind you about what's true tonight,

852
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,840
 from Ephesians five.

853
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,220
 You are God's beloved child, Ephesians five one.

854
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:26,940
 You're a light in the Lord, verse eight.

855
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,740
 You're a child of light, also in verse eight.

856
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:36,460
 Christ shines on you, in verse 14.

857
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:42,500
 You see, life, light, wholeness, freedom,

858
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,660
 is yours tonight in Jesus Christ.

859
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,860
 And wherever you're at,

860
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:52,820
 you can continue to walk in increasing wholeness,

861
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,680
 freedom, life, and joy in Jesus Christ.

862
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,620
 You're not alone as you process your past of sin,

863
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,260
 trauma, and pain.

864
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,860
 You're not alone with whatever it is

865
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,560
 that you're walking through today.

866
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,260
 So my question to you, as we get close to wrapping up,

867
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,360
 is what do you need to bring to the light tonight?

868
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:19,360
 What are your next steps in being honest with yourself,

869
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,400
 and honest with God and others?

870
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,040
 You see, whenever I read through those verses,

871
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,360
 a couple of them, a couple of the phrases in the red,

872
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,960
 one of them said specifically, outsider.

873
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,600
 And there are some here tonight

874
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,880
 who should feel like an outsider.

875
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,200
 Because the truth is, Romans 3:23 tells us,

876
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,480
 Romans 3:23 tells us that all of sin

877
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,380
 have fallen short of the glory of God.

878
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:51,120
 In Romans 6:23 says that the penalty for sin is death.

879
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,760
 And without Jesus, that's where we all end up.

880
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,160
 That's what we all deserve,

881
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,200
 separated from God, living in the consequences

882
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,000
 of our anger, rebellion, and rejection of God.

883
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,080
 Romans 5:8 says that while we were still sinners,

884
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,500
 Christ died for us.

885
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,000
 And Romans 10, 9, and 10 says that if we believe

886
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 that Jesus is Lord, and confess that God raised Him

887
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,880
 from the dead, we will be saved.

888
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,260
 So there is an opportunity tonight,

889
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,280
 if you don't know Jesus as your Lord and Savior,

890
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,040
 if you've come to gatherings like this,

891
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,160
 and conformed and fit in,

892
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,880
 but never trusted Jesus with your life,

893
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,540
 let tonight be the night.

894
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,920
 If anyone is an outsider right now,

895
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,800
 from the grace of Jesus Christ,

896
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,480
 it's only because you're choosing to be.

897
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,120
 Jesus is the Good Shepherd.

898
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,600
 He is calling you to Him tonight.

899
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,420
 Take that step.

900
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,400
 Pray right now, "Lord, save me, I surrender."

901
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,760
 Come down afterwards, and there will be people down here

902
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,300
 who can help you with next steps.

903
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,720
 You're not alone, but take that step now.

904
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,080
 If you have questions, come down here afterwards,

905
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,800
 and we'll stay as long as we need to,

906
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,200
 to talk through it all.

907
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,300
 You're not alone.

908
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,200
 Take that step.

909
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,720
 Respond to Jesus.

910
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,080
 (congregation murmurs)

911
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,840
 Regardless of where you are, what's your next step

912
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,040
 in being honest with yourself and honest with God?

913
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,320
 Is it to start Regen, which happens here every Monday night,

914
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,400
 which is a place to unpack,

915
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,360
 dig in, see what's there under those layers,

916
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,400
 and walk through it with other people

917
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
 who are also doing the same thing?

918
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,680
 Make that commitment tonight.

919
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,640
 If that's your next step, tell somebody,

920
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,920
 hey, that somebody might even come with you next Monday

921
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,600
 to make it easier to walk through those doors,

922
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,460
 but don't ignore the Spirit leading you to respond tonight.

923
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:52,240
 For women, if you've suffered abuse,

924
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,240
 is your next step to come to Courageous Hope,

925
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,680
 which happens here at Watermark?

926
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,200
 It's a group of women who have walked through

927
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,700
 many of the same things,

928
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,120
 who have experienced trauma and abuse,

929
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,120
 and they're ready to listen to your story

930
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,120
 and to walk with you.

931
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,400
 Or if you're a man who has suffered abuse,

932
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,100
 we have men, which is the same thing for guys,

933
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,320
 to be able to walk through, unpack those feelings,

934
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,220
 the things that are still there, that we can't get rid of,

935
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:23,560
 where you can come and be welcomed, loved,

936
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,440
 heard, and supported by other people

937
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,280
 who know what you're walking through.

938
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,120
 You see, they love you so much,

939
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,640
 the men and women leading those ministries,

940
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,960
 that they're here tonight.

941
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,800
 They didn't want you to have to take the next step

942
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,380
 and come on a different night of the week.

943
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,320
 They will be down front to help you

944
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,320
 with next steps tonight.

945
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,720
 So if that is your next step,

946
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,540
 respond to the Spirit and come down here tonight.

947
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:53,060
 Your next step might be to get into a community group,

948
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,740
 to get around friends who aren't your old college buddies

949
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,200
 or your drinking buddies,

950
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,840
 but get around people that will remind you of what's true,

951
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,840
 that will encourage you, that will set an example,

952
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,600
 draw you into things that bring life,

953
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,040
 and not continue to draw you back

954
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,140
 towards the things that bring death.

955
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,600
 Whatever it is for you, take that next step.

956
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,480
 Take it tonight.

957
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,320
 So there's just a couple encouragements

958
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,960
 that I wanna give you as we go from here,

959
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,840
 because here's what happens,

960
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,720
 is sometimes we take a step out into the hard,

961
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,480
 and it's hard, and so then we allow ourselves

962
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,700
 to fall back into the comfortable,

963
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,840
 even though it brings pain and suffering with it.

964
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:36,000
 So don't, we can't fake it 'til we make it.

965
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,300
 Don't focus on the outward,

966
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,360
 let the Spirit work on the inward.

967
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,960
 It'll be messy, it'll be awesome,

968
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,520
 there's life, freedom, hope,

969
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,760
 where the Spirit will lead you through that.

970
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,140
 Two, don't demand immediate results.

971
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:50,880
 Latest part of my journey has been the last 20 years,

972
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,400
 and it hasn't been a straight line.

973
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,380
 Sometimes it's messy.

974
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,440
 Don't expect straight line results, but Jesus has you.

975
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,180
 Don't expect immediate results,

976
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,100
 it'll take longer than you imagine a lot of times.

977
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,180
 Don't earn God's favor, don't try to prove

978
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,780
 that you're a beloved child of God, just receive it.

979
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,500
 But here's a couple things we do need to do.

980
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,920
 We need to immerse ourselves in the Spirit,

981
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,900
 as the Spirit leads you, as the Spirit leads you tonight,

982
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,060
 just follow the Spirit.

983
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,980
 Immerse yourself in God's Word.

984
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,200
 God has given us everything we need to know

985
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,420
 for life and godliness,

986
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,380
 everything that the Spirit will use to transform us

987
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,900
 to walk into that life and that freedom

988
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,940
 that we're talking about tonight.

989
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,680
 And do immerse yourselves in believers,

990
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,700
 the men and women God has placed around you

991
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,100
 to walk with on this journey.

992
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,020
 Do stretch yourself, find running partners,

993
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,340
 find people that will encourage you,

994
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,140
 challenge you, hold you accountable.

995
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,820
 And this one's really important.

996
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,480
 Do give yourself grace.

997
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,300
 If Jesus can give you grace and walk with you,

998
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,320
 you should be able to give yourself grace.

999
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,640
 If the change doesn't happen fast enough,

1000
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,300
 if it's messier than you want it to be,

1001
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,020
 if it's really, really uncomfortable

1002
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,340
 and everything in you is saying run, give yourself grace.

1003
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:10,540
 We are only whole once we find our wholeness in Christ,

1004
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,420
 and your wholeness in Christ

1005
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,460
 matters more than anything else in your life,

1006
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,380
 more than your job, more than your tests,

1007
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,020
 more than your salary, more than your spouse,

1008
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,340
 your future spouse, anything else that's on your mind

1009
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:27,340
 tonight pales in comparison to your wholeness in Christ.

1010
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:32,040
 We're talking about eternity that it starts now,

1011
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,820
 the life that we get to live with Jesus.

1012
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,820
 And we're not alone.

1013
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:40,480
 So it doesn't matter who you are, we're all in process.

1014
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,900
 It doesn't matter if you're the,

1015
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,740
 this is your first time here, first time tuning in.

1016
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,940
 It doesn't matter if you're a porch leader

1017
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,180
 who've been coming for a while

1018
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,820
 and you're discipling and leading others.

1019
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,340
 And frankly, it doesn't matter if you're an elder,

1020
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,720
 if you're a pastor, we're all in process.

1021
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,800
 And just as an example,

1022
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,920
 Better Man is kind of like a new version of men's fraternity

1023
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,720
 that man in our body paired up to develop with Robert Lewis.

1024
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,920
 And we have a couple of groups

1025
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,280
 going through it here at Watermark.

1026
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,320
 And I was facilitating a table this summer,

1027
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,180
 a group of men, awesome men,

1028
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:20,080
 but the Spirit was doing work in my heart too.

1029
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,520
 And so what happened, we're going through this stuff,

1030
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,560
 talking about dad wounds, talking about our past,

1031
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,360
 talking about what is a godly man.

1032
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,760
 And I just realized,

1033
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:33,760
 there's some stuff I still need to do business with.

1034
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,760
 You see what happens is we have those wounds that we hide,

1035
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,740
 the wounds that we don't process, and they fester,

1036
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,320
 and they generate poison.

1037
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:49,680
 And that poison, Satan uses just to seep into us.

1038
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,420
 Right, I've had the hand wound that got infected,

1039
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:54,840
 I didn't go to the doctor,

1040
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,360
 and the veins will just start turning blue.

1041
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,440
 And that's what this thing felt like.

1042
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,520
 And this stuff happened in elementary school,

1043
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,280
 things that happened to me, things that I had done.

1044
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,840
 In the times when Satan would afflict me the most,

1045
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,900
 I would be sitting where y'all were, praising,

1046
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,040
 having a sweet moment with God,

1047
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,600
 and Satan would just inject me with some of that poison.

1048
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,540
 If everybody just knew who you really were,

1049
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,440
 that secret you're gonna take to the grave,

1050
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,920
 you're not who you say you are.

1051
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,320
 You're not who Jesus says you are.

1052
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,760
 And if we hide it, if we cover it up,

1053
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,120
 that infection is free just to seep into us.

1054
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,400
 And I felt the spirit calling me this summer,

1055
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,200
 and the spirit brought it about

1056
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,120
 where I was talking to my wife late one night in August,

1057
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,980
 and I just started sharing.

1058
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:43,040
 I didn't intend to, it just started bubbling out with tears,

1059
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,400
 all in the mess.

1060
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,980
 I shared more about the past abuse,

1061
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,280
 I shared more about this stuff

1062
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,420
 that I thought I was gonna take to the grave.

1063
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:55,560
 I feared rejection, I feared the weakness.

1064
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:00,920
 And you know what the one thing she said was?

1065
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,800
 The first thing?

1066
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,520
 Thanks for letting me in.

1067
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,720
 Thanks for trusting me with this,

1068
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,140
 and we're in it together.

1069
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:16,400
 And that's how Jesus walks with us.

1070
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,620
 I got to see the tangible grace and love of God

1071
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,080
 experienced through the words of my wife

1072
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,120
 just two and a half months ago.

1073
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:31,280
 Jesus keeps us, he walks with us,

1074
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,560
 and we'll be here with you as long as we need to tonight.

1075
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,520
 You are not alone.

1076
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:40,960
 So what step is God calling you to take here tonight?

1077
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:46,880
 Know that no matter what you're feeling

1078
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,440
 or experiencing right now, God has you in his hands,

1079
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,740
 and I'll close with these words.

1080
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:58,420
 For I am sure that neither death nor life,

1081
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:02,220
 nor angels nor rulers, nor things present,

1082
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,500
 nor things that come, nor powers,

1083
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,980
 nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation

1084
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,780
 will be able to separate us from the love of God

1085
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,700
 in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

1086
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,540
 Amen.

1087
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,160
 And I would ask you to stand now.

1088
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,460
 Feel free to listen to this song, sing this song,

1089
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:26,000
 pray this song, and respond as the Spirit continues

1090
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,200
 to speak to you tonight.
