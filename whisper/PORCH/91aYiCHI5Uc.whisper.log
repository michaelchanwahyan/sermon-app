[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.720]   Wow, yeah.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.720]   Hello, everyone.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.720]   I can't believe this. Thank you.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.720]   So good to be back at the porch so soon.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.720]   It's amazing I was here just before the end of the year last year.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.720]   And so great to be back with Sean and Mel and Passion tonight.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.720]   We're just kind of cruising around the country for a few weeks,
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.720]   dropping in on campuses and into gatherings like the porch.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.720]   And so thanks for having us.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.720]   We're actually just kind of coming to bring Passion to people.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.720]   We are having two big Passion gatherings in a few months,
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.720]   one of them here in the Metroplex, which we're pumped about,
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.720]   and one in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.720]   But we're not really here to sell that tonight because both of them
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.720]   are almost sold out as we speak right now.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.720]   So it would be impossible for all of you to come to Passion
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.720]   at Dallas-Fort Worth right now.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.720]   So we're excited about that, but we're really just excited about tonight.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.720]   So, David, thanks for having us. Thanks for having me.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.720]   Grateful to be at the porch and be under your leadership tonight.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.720]   Pretty awesome that my friend T.A. has become part of the team here
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.720]   since I was here last time, if you're a watermark person,
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.720]   and that's pretty great.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.720]   So a smattering of applause.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.720]   T.A., I think, might be here, so maybe he wanted to hear
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.720]   just a little more enthusiasm than that.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.720]   [cheers and applause]
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.720]   I don't know if he's here. He was here, but I'm hoping he left early
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.720]   because that was heartbreaking.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.720]   Anyway, it's good to be here tonight, and I just want to really put
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.720]   a big idea on the table.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.720]   And I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the biggest idea
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.720]   that's on your table.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.720]   And I know there are a lot of big things on your table.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.720]   People gathered all over America linking into this right now.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.720]   A lot of people in their first job, second job.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.720]   Anybody in your first or second job that's here tonight?
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.720]   Okay, anybody in your ninth job already that are going by fast
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.720]   or clicking along?
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.720]   Anybody need a job that's here tonight, and you're like,
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.720]   "I'd really love to be in my first or second job."
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.720]   Anybody in a relationship here, you know, like a meaningful,
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.720]   potential, could-be-lifelong relationship here?
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.720]   Okay, they're all pointing at you. Congratulations. That's amazing.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.720]   I didn't even know those people existed anymore.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.720]   I'm a little out of touch with how things are working these days.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.720]   Anybody want to be in a relationship this here night?
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.720]   You're like, "Louie, why do you think we came to the porch?
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.720]   You think we love Jesus that much? No!
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.720]   We're here hoping for a miracle."
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.720]   You need healing? No, I need somebody.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.720]   You need a breakthrough? No, I need somebody.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.720]   A lot of people here are going through struggle.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   You're asking big questions.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.720]   You want to know if you're on the right track.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.720]   You want to know if you're in the flow of what God has for your life.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.720]   Some of you are not even sure if God has a flow for your life.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.720]   But I'm telling you there's something bigger than all that,
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.720]   bigger than whether you're in the right grad program,
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.720]   you're in the right job, you're on the right track,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.720]   you're in the right career, you're possibly going to meet somebody
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.720]   or figure out what it is that God really has for you to do in life.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.720]   And there's something bigger than all that.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   And the thing that's bigger than all that is crazy.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.720]   And I don't want to hype it up too much, but it's crazy.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.720]   And the reason why we won't all fall on the floor in a minute
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.720]   when we start talking more specifically about it
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.720]   is because a lot of us have been around it too much.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.720]   And we've been around church too much.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.720]   We've been around things like tonight too much
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.720]   to really take a step back and be absolutely blown away by this idea.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.720]   Are you ready for it?
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.720]   Yahweh, that's the God of gods, the one true God,
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.720]   the creator of the cosmos and everything that exists.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.720]   That all powerful forever existing being
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.720]   who needs nothing and has never needed anyone,
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.720]   who dwells in absolute bright, glorious light
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.720]   is inviting you to come as close to him as you want to
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.720]   and to know as much about him as you're willing to come and see.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   I like that.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.720]   (congregation cheering)
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.720]   Can we just let that sink in for a minute, David?
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.720]   Yahweh has opened the way
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.720]   for you to come up the mountain
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.720]   and see the glory of God.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.720]   I went to grad school in Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.720]   I was going to say Fort Worth, Texas, but you know where Fort Worth is.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.720]   I don't speak a lot of other places.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.720]   I went to grad school in Fort Worth.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   And it was in another lifetime ago.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.720]   It was before anything.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.720]   So whatever there is, it was before all that.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.720]   Phones were stuck on the wall
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.720]   and there was no technology of any kind.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.720]   There was no social media.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.720]   There was nothing.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.720]   And I was sitting in the library one night, as I would be,
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.720]   about nine o'clock,
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.720]   and I was dating my now wife, who's a student at Baylor.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.720]   And she was at Baylor,
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.720]   but I didn't know what she was doing at Baylor
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.720]   because I couldn't text her.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.720]   I couldn't check her feed.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.720]   I couldn't call her on my cell phone.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.720]   So I don't know what she was doing.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.720]   Probably some frat boy chasing her down, for all I know,
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.720]   because everybody at the school was after her.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.720]   And I'm sitting here reading church history
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.720]   and I'm thinking about her being,
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.720]   her dorm was 68.2 miles away from the campus.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.720]   And specifically, and I thought, you know,
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.720]   I could make a move right now.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.720]   So I just packed all my stuff up, got in my car
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.720]   and just started down I-35.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.720]   And I said, I'm going.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.720]   I don't know what's happening.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   I don't know what she's doing, but I'm about to find out.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   So she was living in Memorial Dorm at the time.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.720]   So I pull onto campus, pull up to Memorial Dorm.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.720]   I'd stopped on the way.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.720]   I didn't have hardly any money.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.720]   Maybe had 10 bucks on me, probably.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.720]   No debit cards back then, sorry.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.720]   I mean, it's another lifetime.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.720]   I know it's hard to really get your head in that space,
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.720]   but it's just another world, another era.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.720]   I'm coming to you from another time, okay?
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   And so I stopped at the gas station
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   when I get off the freeway and I buy two Hawaiian punches.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.720]   I know that doesn't even make sense.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.720]   Does anybody even know what that is?
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.720]   Does that exist anymore?
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.720]   Okay, well, that was our thing.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.720]   That was our thing.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.720]   Our thing was Hawaiian punch.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.720]   So I buy two Hawaiian punches.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.720]   I go park, I walk down the sidewalk,
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.720]   I go in Memorial Dorm.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.720]   There's a dorm lady who sits at a little desk
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.720]   and she runs the show.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.720]   So I walk up to her and I set the two cans on the counter
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.720]   and I say, "Can you call up to Shelly Graves' room?"
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.720]   Hoping she's up there.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.720]   It's about, you know, now it's like 10.30.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.720]   And I say, "And can you tell her
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.720]   "that someone left something for her at the desk?"
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.720]   She says, "Absolutely."
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.720]   So she picks up the phone, she starts dialing.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.720]   I go around, you know, through the lobby,
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.720]   go behind a plant over here
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.720]   where I can barely see the counter
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.720]   and I'm just waiting it out.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.720]   And so sure enough, she comes down,
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.720]   she sees the two cans on the counter.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.720]   She knows that I have arrived.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.720]   And so she starts looking around
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.720]   and I pop out from behind the plant
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.720]   and we have a big handshake.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.720]   It's a Baptist school.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.720]   And so we shake hands and we sit out on the steps
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.720]   with our Hawaiian punches
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.720]   and she has a major test the next morning.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.720]   She's up there just like studying like crazy
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.720]   and she's like, "I gotta keep studying,
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.720]   "but this is amazing."
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.720]   And we drank the Hawaiian punches.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.720]   Please, somebody give me bear witness, if you know
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.720]   anything about the atmosphere I'm in right now.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.720]   We drank the Hawaiian punches.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.720]   We sat shoulder to shoulder on the steps
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.720]   in front of the dorm.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.720]   I put my arm around her.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.720]   She said, "This is so great.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.720]   "You're so sweet.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.720]   "Thank you so much for coming."
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.720]   I said, "I just was thinking about you
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.720]   "in the middle of studying
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.720]   "and I thought I can get there."
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.720]   And so I love you and do great on your test.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.720]   15 minutes had transpired and I'm back in the car
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.720]   heading back to Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.720]   'Cause I got stuff too.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.720]   I got an eight o'clock class also.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.720]   And I'm rolling back into my apartment.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.720]   It's like, I don't know, 1230 for 15 minutes.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.720]   Anybody ever been there before?
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.720]   Anybody ever been there?
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.720]   No, nobody's ever had this experience?
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.720]   Really?
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.720]   Oh my gosh, dear Lord.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.720]   I wanna pray for these people tonight.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:20.720]   Have you never done anything that didn't make any sense?
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   No, no, no, not in life.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.720]   Because you were so fixated on somebody
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:39.720]   that an hour and a half drive for a 15 minute moment
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.720]   seemed like the most reasonable thing on earth.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.720]   But yet you flip the equation a little bit
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.720]   and we've got Yahweh who's saying,
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.720]   "I've made a way for you to come
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.720]   as close to me as you want to.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:13.720]   And you can know my glory."
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:18.720]   I wanna take us back to a story in the Old Testament.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.720]   If you have your scripture,
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.720]   I'm gonna drop down into a verse
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.720]   that God really put in my heart for these nights.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.720]   And it's Exodus 34, two.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.720]   But let me give us a little context.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.720]   We're talking about Moses.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.720]   Moses, you remember Moses.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.720]   His mom put him in a basket, put him in the river.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.720]   He's raised in Pharaoh's household.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.720]   Eventually, because of his defense of his own people
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.720]   being persecuted by the Pharaoh,
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.720]   he has to flee out into the wilderness.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.720]   And after a long time, God finds him in the wilderness
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.720]   and says, "Moses, I'm gonna use you
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.720]   to deliver my people from Egypt."
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.720]   And he does.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.720]   And so they go through the Red Sea.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.720]   They have a cloud by day and fire by night.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.720]   And now they're in the wilderness
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.720]   tracking along with God.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.720]   And God is working his plan out
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.720]   through this man called Moses.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.720]   And eventually, he invites Moses up on Mount Sinai,
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.720]   the holy mountain of God.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.720]   Now, this is the gospel, by the way.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.720]   If you just got here and you don't know why we're here,
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.720]   this part of the story is the gospel part of the story
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.720]   that we're all celebrating tonight.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.720]   There was a mountain in the wilderness called Mount Sinai.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.720]   It was the holy place of God.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.720]   God had even established it as so and said,
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.720]   "Don't anybody come near this mountain.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.720]   Don't touch it or you'll die."
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.720]   This is God's holy mountain.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   But he invited Moses up on the mountain.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.720]   This is a precursor to him inviting you
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.720]   and inviting me through Jesus
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.720]   to come into the holy place of God.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.720]   And if somebody did amen that tonight,
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   I'm just gonna park right here.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.720]   We are invited through Jesus into,
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.720]   not into church, not into a thing,
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.720]   not into some kind of religion,
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.720]   but we're invited into the holy place of God
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.720]   through the finished work of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   Anybody can come.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.720]   A felon can come.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.720]   The best person in town can come.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   The nicest person on the planet can come.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.720]   The biggest failure can come.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.720]   Anybody can come.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.720]   An atheist can come.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   A person who grew up in a Christian home can come.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.720]   Somebody with a broken story can come.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.720]   Somebody who's doing pretty good can come.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:11.720]   Anybody through Jesus can come up the holy mountain of God.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   And you don't have to come up that mountain
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   on your own merit.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   Jesus has made a way.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.720]   But even in the Old Testament,
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.720]   God's tipping his hand.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.720]   And he says to Moses,
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.720]   I'm inviting you up on the mountain.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.720]   Bring two stone tablets with you
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.720]   and meet me on the mountain.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.720]   And he came up the mountain of God.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.720]   Stayed up there a while.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.720]   He's up there longer than people thought
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.720]   he was gonna be up there.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.720]   He's got God's laws written on stone
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.720]   by the hand of God.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   And when he finally comes down the mountain,
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.720]   the people, they thought, well, he's never coming back.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.720]   So they decided, I don't know where they got this crazy idea
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.720]   to melt down all their jewelry
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.720]   and make a golden calf and worship the golden calf.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.720]   Moses is up on the mountain of God's glory.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.720]   They're down here dancing around a golden calf.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.720]   Isn't that dumb?
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.720]   Can you imagine being that stupid?
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.720]   That you could be up on the mountain in God's glory
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.720]   and instead you're down dancing around a golden calf?
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.720]   Isn't that the dumbest thing you could ever think of?
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.720]   Oh, no, it's not actually that dumb, is it?
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.720]   He comes down, he sees the calf,
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.720]   he throws his tablets down, they smash on the ground.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.720]   He tells the people to destroy the idol because why?
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.720]   He's been up on the mountain of God.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.720]   And I'm telling you, God is inviting you up the mountain.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   Once he came down, a few things transpired.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.720]   In chapter 33, one of the greatest chapters in the Bible,
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.720]   one of the most pivotal chapters in scripture
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.720]   for me in my life and following Jesus,
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.720]   A, he's in the tent of meeting with God,
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   this tent that they carry through the wilderness.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.720]   And it says when he went in the tent of meeting,
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.720]   Moses, the cloud of God's glory would come down on the tent
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.720]   and they would talk, it says,
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   like a friend talks to his friend.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.720]   And it wasn't like he was seeing God face to face,
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.720]   but that's how intimate they were.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.720]   Yahweh was talking to Moses
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.720]   like we talk to each other face to face.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.720]   And then Moses would leave the tent
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.720]   and the cloud would disperse from the tent.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.720]   It says, but his young aid, Joshua, he wouldn't leave
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.720]   because he couldn't get enough of this idea
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.720]   that God, Yahweh, the creator would meet
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   with a man or with a woman.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.720]   And then the conversation unfolds of what happened there.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.720]   And it was Moses saying,
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.720]   you've told us that you're gonna lead us on,
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   but how are people gonna know we're your people
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.720]   when we go on?
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.720]   And God said, well, I'm gonna go with you.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.720]   And this was one of the greatest lines
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.720]   in all of scripture to me.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.720]   And Moses said, well, of course you're gonna go with us
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.720]   because if you don't go with us, we're not going.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:49.720]   But then he asked for something else.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.720]   He said, I wanna ask you one more thing.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.720]   See the progression?
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.720]   How people gonna know we're different?
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.720]   God said, I'm going with you.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.720]   He said, okay, well, we're not going
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.720]   if you're not going with us.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.720]   Wouldn't that be amazing?
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.720]   We just parked right there tonight.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   I'm not going if you're not going with me.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.720]   I'm not getting in this relationship
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.720]   if you're not getting in the relationship.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.720]   I'm not getting on this path if you're not on this path.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.720]   I'm not investing time and energy in this thing
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.720]   if you're not investing time and energy in this thing.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.720]   If you're not going, I'm not going.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.720]   It's not like, hey, I love you
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   and I'll check in with you later.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.720]   I got some other paths to get on.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.720]   It's like, no, if you're not getting on the path,
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.720]   I'm not getting on the path.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.720]   But then he said, it's not enough for me
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.720]   to know that you're going with me.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.720]   I think for the average believer,
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.720]   the conversation could have ended right there
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.720]   and we'd be fine.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.720]   God said, he's going with us, we're good.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.720]   But Moses said, no, that's not enough for me.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.720]   And then he took his shot.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.720]   I love it.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.720]   He just took his shot.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.720]   And he said, no, show me your glory.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.720]   I'm glad that you're going,
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.720]   but I want to see your glory.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.720]   And I just wonder tonight at the porch
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.720]   where we are gathered all over the nation tonight,
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.720]   is there somebody at the porch that says,
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   it's not enough for me that God is going to bless my way.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:22.720]   I want God more than I want God to bless.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.720]   To bless my way.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.720]   Has anybody today taken a shot with heaven
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   and said to God almighty, show me your glory.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.720]   I'm telling you, God didn't even think about it.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.720]   He said, okay, okay.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.720]   But I'm going to have to stick you in a crack of a rock
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.720]   and I'm about to put my hand on top of you.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.720]   And then I'm going to let my goodness pass by you.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.720]   And I'm going to let you see the back of me going by.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.720]   Because if I don't do that, you won't make it off the mountain.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.720]   You'll be obliterated by my glory, but come on.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.720]   And then this verse, I love it.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.720]   In chapter 34, he says in verse two,
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:17.720]   be ready in the morning and then come up on Mount Sinai.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:23.720]   Be ready in the morning and come up the holy mountain.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.720]   I'm inviting you up the mountain of God.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.720]   And then he says to him, present yourself to me
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:40.720]   there on top of the mountain.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.720]   If I put a title on this message tonight,
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.720]   it would be next level.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.720]   It's the crazy idea that God is saying the very same thing
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.720]   to you and me because of Jesus
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.720]   that he was saying to Moses on this day.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.720]   Get ready in the morning.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:05.720]   And if you want to come up Mount Sinai and present yourself.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.720]   God, here I am.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.720]   I wasn't satisfied down on the lower level.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.720]   I wasn't satisfied at the lodge with the hot chocolate.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.720]   I wasn't satisfied at the lookout we could drive to.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.720]   I came all the way up to the top of the mountain
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.720]   and I am presenting myself here before you today saying,
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:32.720]   I want to see and taste the glory of God.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.720]   I don't want any less than you.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.720]   I just want you.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.720]   I think so many times we stop with, I need God's help.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.720]   I need God's direction.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.720]   I need God's input.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.720]   I need God's discernment.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.720]   I need God's wisdom.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.720]   I need God's truth.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.720]   I need God's principle.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.720]   I need God's blessing.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.720]   And all those things are great.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.720]   But God loves the heart that says more than the blessing,
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.720]   more than the wisdom, more than the insight,
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.720]   more than the truth, more than the principle, I want you.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.720]   It's like the psalmist who encouraged us,
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.720]   delight yourself in the Lord and he'll give you the desires
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.720]   of your heart.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   And I read that about three weeks ago and I was like,
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.720]   oh my word, if I don't have everything my heart desires,
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.720]   it's on me.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:22.720]   Because I have the option of delighting myself in the Lord.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.720]   I can't delight you in the Lord,
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.720]   but I can delight myself in the Lord.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.720]   And when I delight myself in the Lord,
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:33.720]   he promises to give me the desires of my heart.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.720]   I think the way that equation works, by the way,
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.720]   is that the more I say, I just want you,
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.720]   the more my heart turns into being satisfied completely
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.720]   in him.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   And I get in him everything that I've desired
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.720]   because he is all that I need.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.720]   We were created by God and for God, Colossians.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.720]   And I pray like you've been studying in Ephesians chapter one
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.720]   that God would open the eyes of our heart
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.720]   and give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.720]   and the knowledge of God that we might know him better.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.720]   Revelation is what happens when the Holy Spirit
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.720]   takes information and blows it up in our heart
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.720]   and in our mind.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:15.720]   And what we knew now is absolutely vivid in our hearts
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.720]   and it is capturing our desire and our total imagination.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.720]   And we move toward God like we've never moved before.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.720]   I pray that tonight in God,
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.720]   I pray in the name of Jesus right now
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.720]   across all the porch gatherings
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.720]   that you would give a spirit of wisdom
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.720]   and revelation and the knowledge of God.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.720]   I pray that someone's eyes will be open.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.720]   The eyes of their heart will be enlightened
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.720]   that they may know you more.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.720]   Why?
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.720]   Because he's better.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.720]   He's better.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.720]   David said it this way in Psalm 27 verse four.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.720]   He said, "One thing I ask of the Lord."
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.720]   Man, how clarifying is that?
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.720]   "And that will I seek."
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   One thing.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.720]   If you give me one thing, one shot, one opportunity,
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.720]   what am I gonna put at the end of that?
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.720]   Dear God, please, what's gonna go in that blank?
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.720]   He said, "I'll tell you what's in my blank.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.720]   "If I get one shot, one thing I'm gonna ask of the Lord,
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.720]   "one thing I'm gonna seek,
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   "that I may dwell in the house of the Lord
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.720]   "all the days of my life."
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.720]   Check this phrase,
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.720]   "To gaze upon the beauty of the Lord
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.720]   "and to meditate in his temple."
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:24.720]   If I get one shot, I just want you.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:30.720]   I think the question tonight is, what is my one shot?
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.720]   What's your one shot?
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.720]   What's your one thing?
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.720]   If it all comes down to this, what is the this?
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:44.720]   If it all comes down to this, what is the this?
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.720]   And is it truly for me that this is,
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.720]   I just want you.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.720]   I think it starts tonight with you seeing
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.720]   that that's his this.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.720]   He just wants you.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   Of course he has a will for your life
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.720]   and a purpose and a plan.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.720]   Of course he gave you gifts, abilities,
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.720]   aptitudes and opportunities.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.720]   Of course he wants to use you to impact your generation,
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.720]   your neighborhood, your community,
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.720]   your place of work, your family.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   Of course he wants you to leave a legacy
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.720]   for his glory on planet earth.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.720]   Of course he has work for you to do.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.720]   Of course he wants to give you meaning in life.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.720]   But more than all of that stuff,
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.720]   he just wants you
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.720]   to the degree that Jesus made a way
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.720]   for you to come up the holy mountain.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.720]   Come up the holy mountain of God.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.720]   And this is the most mind blowing thought of all.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.720]   You can go as high as you want to go.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.720]   A.W. Toews is a brilliant theologian and preacher.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.720]   He said it this way.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.720]   Every person is as close to God as they want to be.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.720]   You're like, no, I've had hardship.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.720]   Doesn't matter.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.720]   Hardship doesn't stop you from being close to God,
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.720]   according to Romans.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.720]   Yeah, but I've had a disappointing life.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.720]   I know, but disappointing lives
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.720]   don't stop us from being close to God.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.720]   They actually propel us to being closer to God.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.720]   But I've been through a lot of pain.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.720]   I know, and you know what pain does?
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.720]   It pushes us closer to God.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.720]   Oh, the enemy can use it to push us away from God,
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.720]   but the spirit uses pain to push us closer to God.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.720]   I've never been closer to God in my life
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.720]   than the most desperate painful moments that I've walked in,
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.720]   where I had nothing but to absolutely fall
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   in the grace of God.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.720]   And you know what happened when I did?
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   I found that the grace of God is actually real
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   and actually as powerful as we say it is.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.720]   And if you've lost a loved one
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.720]   or held the hand of someone in your family
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.720]   when they took their last breath,
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.720]   or you've gotten a phone call in news,
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.720]   it was absolutely tragic and devastating.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.720]   You know that the grace of God is real.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.720]   The love of God is real.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.720]   The power of God is real.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.720]   But what about the beauty?
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.720]   When's the last time anybody said,
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.720]   I'm sorry, I'm not gonna be able to make it.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.720]   I've carved out that time to just gaze on the beauty
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.720]   of God.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   When is the last time anybody said,
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.720]   I've only got 15 minutes
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.720]   and it's gonna take me an hour and a half to get there.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.720]   But when I get there, I'm gonna be there with Yahweh.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.720]   So I'm gone.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   And when they got back, they were like,
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.720]   absolutely worth it.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.720]   Absolutely worth it.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.720]   And I just wanna encourage us all in that way.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.720]   You can go as high on the mountain as you want to.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.720]   There is no place on this mountain that says, I'm sorry,
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.720]   authorized personnel only, beyond this point.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:26.720]   And if I don't make it to glory,
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:31.720]   it's because I didn't want to.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:39.720]   It's because I got sold something less and I took it.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:48.720]   I'm old and so you would expect me to say this,
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:54.720]   but I'm not in the TikTok promised land yet.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.720]   I mean, I might be, but it's not because of me.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.720]   Somebody else has put me in the TikTok promised land.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.720]   But I know the explore page on Instagram.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   And I know that reels are real.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.720]   And I don't know what Instagram thinks about me,
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   but it knows that I love dogs,
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.720]   older dogs that get puppies in boxes.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.720]   I know that Instagram knows I like that.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.720]   I know that Instagram knows that I like to see yachts
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.720]   on fire apparently, 'cause every day
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.720]   I get another yacht on fire.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.720]   I know that Instagram knows that I like to see people
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.720]   that I don't know, couples that I don't know,
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.720]   dancing in their four years.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:39.720]   I don't know what this says about me,
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.720]   but Instagram knows I like the outfit of the day.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.720]   I don't even buy women's clothes online,
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.720]   but apparently they think I want to.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:56.720]   And if you drop into that zone,
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.720]   does anybody ever get into that world?
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.720]   It is amazing, isn't it, how the math works.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.720]   Like you go in there at like 7.40
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:09.720]   and you come out at like 9.10
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.720]   and you haven't eaten.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:19.720]   You've missed, you know, someone coming by the house.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.720]   I'm exaggerating a little bit,
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.720]   but it's amazing how little by little,
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:33.720]   TikTok, TikTok, TikTok.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:38.720]   Maybe there's a reason why it's called TikTok,
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.720]   'cause it's TikToking our lives away.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:47.720]   And it might be TikToking us to death.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   And I can say this because I'm old
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.720]   and no one will care because I'm old,
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.720]   but I was lost in the explore page
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.720]   watching yachts catch on fire.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.720]   Does anybody else,
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.720]   Instagram want you to see yachts catching on fire?
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.720]   You're like, I didn't even know that was on there.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.720]   No, it's amazing.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.720]   It's just phenomenal.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.720]   Either catching on fire or running over dogs.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.720]   Either one, I'm fascinated.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.720]   The bigger, the better.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.720]   120 foot yacht,
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.720]   it just ran over a dock and three other yachts.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.720]   Wow, that is amazing.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   I'm gonna watch that again.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.720]   And I was lost in the reels.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.720]   And this is true.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.720]   This is not, I'm not trying to spiritualize.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.720]   And when I came out of Never Never Land,
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.720]   sitting right on the dock,
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.720]   sitting right next to me was this.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.720]   And I thought what would happen
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:52.720]   if God's spirit ignited our hearts in such a way
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:57.720]   that we could open this living, breathing miracle.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.720]   And all of a sudden,
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.720]   like it was 740 when we went in, I know it was,
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.720]   but somehow it was 910 when I came out.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.720]   And I don't know what happened.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.720]   I missed a meal.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.720]   I missed two texts.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:22.720]   I went up the mountain of God.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.720]   That same A.W. Tozer, I was reading,
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.720]   I've read a lot about him in my life,
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.720]   but I was reading a story about him.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.720]   He died in the '60s, been gone for a minute.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.720]   But it said, one of the people that worked for him
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   said he came in to his office like he would do.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.720]   And he would get in this little corner and pray.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.720]   And they said he's praying in his office.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.720]   And normally that would happen for a bit, an hour or so.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.720]   But it kept going and he never came out to say,
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.720]   "Hey, okay, I'm ready to do the day."
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.720]   And so his assistant was sitting out
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.720]   where she would normally sit and 11 o'clock came
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.720]   and then lunchtime came and then two o'clock came
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.720]   and then five o'clock came.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.720]   And she finally thought, "I gotta go home."
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.720]   So she's packing all her stuff up
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.720]   and she doesn't know what's happened.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.720]   So finally she's very nervously
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.720]   kind of knocks on the door and cracks the door.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.720]   And A.W. Tozer's in there in the corner with God.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.720]   And she says, "Excuse me, Dr. Tozer."
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.720]   And he kind of startles him a little bit.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.720]   And she says, "I'm sorry, but,"
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.720]   and he said, "What time is it?"
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.720]   And she said, "Well, it's quitting time.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.720]   "It's five o'clock and I've got to head home now."
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.720]   And he says, "Oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:33.720]   "I had no idea what time it was."
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:39.720]   And I thought, "Have I ever done that one time in my life?
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.720]   "That I went up the mountain of God
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.720]   "and got into atmosphere in an altitude
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.720]   "in a place with a vista
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.720]   "and the revelation of God and His glory
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:58.720]   "and I just completely lost track of everything."
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.720]   And I believe that's the generation that God's looking for.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:12.720]   A generation where somebody steps forward and says,
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.720]   "I want one thing.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.720]   "And one thing I'm gonna seek.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.720]   "Oh, I'm gonna get my work done.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.720]   "I'm gonna do well in my company.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.720]   "I'm gonna try to figure out how to add value
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.720]   "to everything I'm doing.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.720]   "But I'm telling you, I will not be robbed of this one thing.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.720]   "I wanna dwell in the house of the Lord
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.720]   "all the days of my life.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.720]   "And I wanna gaze on the beauty of the Lord
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.720]   "and I wanna meditate in His temple.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.720]   "I wanna know His glory.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.720]   "I do not wanna be satisfied with knowing about Him.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.720]   "I want Him to be my awe and awe.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.720]   "I wanna say, 'You are my first love.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.720]   "'You are the this in my equation, in my life.'"
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.720]   I'll tell you a couple of things that will happen
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.720]   really fast, we'll close.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.720]   Number one, your whole worldview will be changed
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.720]   up on the mountain of God.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.720]   Everything will change up there,
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.720]   but it'll all be great
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.720]   because it will be reorganized by the glory of God.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.720]   Secondly, when you come down from the mountain of God,
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.720]   you will no longer tolerate any idol
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.720]   because you have seen and tasted that the Lord is good.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.720]   And foolishness, this is kind of the phrase
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.720]   God's been putting in my heart.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.720]   Foolishness will have no place.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.720]   You'll come down from the mountain of God
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.720]   and people say, "Hey, you wanna do whatever?"
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.720]   And you'll be like, "No."
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.720]   Right now you have nothing to compare it with.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.720]   It's like, "Okay, I got nothing else happening right now."
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.720]   But when you've been on the mountain of God
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.720]   and you come down and people say,
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.720]   "Well, we're going here."
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.720]   And you're like, "No, I don't think so."
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.720]   "Why?"
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.720]   "Because I don't have a space for foolishness in my life.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.720]   "I get one life, one set of breath.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.720]   "I don't know how many I've got coming through these lungs.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.720]   "But I promise you one thing,
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.720]   "with these lungs I'm going up the mountain of God
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.720]   "and I'm gonna meet Him there, be changed by Him there."
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.720]   And here's the last thing about it.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.720]   When you've been up there, you're gonna be lit.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.720]   You will not have to tell anybody,
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.720]   "Well, you know what, yesterday I was with God.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:20.720]   "Yesterday I just turned everything off,
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.720]   "closed down all the apps,
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.720]   "decided I was gonna get in the presence of God
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.720]   "and stay there and I did and it was amazing."
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.720]   No, you don't have to give that speech.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.720]   When you've been up Mount Sinai,
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.720]   through Christ you've been on the mountain of God,
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.720]   you will be lit.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:40.720]   Moses' face glowed from the back of God's goodness
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.720]   when his hand covered him in a crack in a rock.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.720]   How much more are our faces going to glow
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.720]   when through the Holy Spirit,
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.720]   we come into fellowship with God Almighty
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.720]   because of the work of Jesus Christ?
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.720]   Paul said, "We're gonna be changed from moment to moment,
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.720]   "from glory to glory
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.720]   "and we're not gonna have to worry about our litness fading.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.720]   "We are going to be bright and radiant."
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.720]   Those who look to him, the psalmist said, are radiant
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.720]   and their faces are never covered in shame.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.720]   I wonder if anybody has got a hunger tonight
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:29.720]   to put down the foolishness
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:36.720]   and to put down this idea of being satisfied
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.720]   with a low level coffee
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.720]   when God's inviting you
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:48.720]   to come as high up the mountain as you wanna come.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.720]   And he'll draw you and pull you
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.720]   by a flame that burns within you.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.720]   But it starts, I think, with us saying,
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:01.720]   "God, I want to come up the mountain."
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.720]   I don't know what's gonna have to go,
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.720]   but I'm never gonna say I don't have time for God.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.720]   I'm gonna say, "I'm sorry, I don't have time for that.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.720]   "I'm sorry, I'm not gonna be able to join y'all for that.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.720]   "I'm sorry, not gonna be able to get my run in today.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.720]   "I'm sorry, I'm not gonna be able to put that
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   "on the schedule today because I promise you,
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:24.720]   "there is one thing, and I'm getting the one thing.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.720]   "I'm getting the one thing."
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:32.720]   If that seems to resonate with you, I wanna pray for you.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:36.720]   I don't think it's a lot of people necessarily,
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.720]   but I know there's somebody right now,
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.720]   and your heart is literally beating faster
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.720]   than it was when you got here.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:45.720]   And you wanna say to God tonight,
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:50.720]   "I want to see, I need to see.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:54.720]   "I was made to see your glory."
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   And I'm sorry that I hadn't made it up very high,
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:09.720]   but if you'll have me, I wanna come, I wanna come.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:14.720]   Could you just stand?
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.720]   That's just more for you than for us.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.720]   Could you just stand if that's you while I pray
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.720]   so I'll know who I'm praying for?
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:25.720]   (gentle music)
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.720]   I'll just invite you just to open your hands.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:57.720]   It's just a way of saying to the Lord, "I'm letting go.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.720]   "Letting go of the thing that I was leaning on
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:06.720]   "to comfort me or to numb me or to entertain me
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:10.720]   "or to distract me, I'm letting go.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.720]   "And what I want is you.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.720]   "I just want you."
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.720]   Lord, I really can't organize a journey
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:30.720]   for anybody but me.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.720]   But Holy Spirit, I pray tonight
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.720]   that you would kindle a new flame
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.720]   in the heart of every person
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.720]   that is longing for something more.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.720]   And I ask you to do that in the name that is power,
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.720]   the name that made the way.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   Lord, we don't want any striving
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.720]   and we're not into any striving tonight,
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.720]   but we do know that we're not just magically
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.720]   gonna get up the mountain.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:08.720]   And so will you ignite a determination to press through,
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:13.720]   a determination to not settle,
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.720]   a determination to not give up,
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.720]   a determination that says, "I'm gonna keep coming.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.720]   "Feelings or no feelings, I'm gonna keep coming
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:27.720]   "until I see something that literally blows me away
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:32.720]   "and changes everything."
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:38.720]   Lord, I ask that, that you would give a brand new heart.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.720]   The heart of Joshua
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.720]   would be in these sons and daughters tonight.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.720]   I'm not leaving the tent.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:51.720]   I'm not leaving the tent.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.720]   I'm not rushing away.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.720]   I'm not in a hurry.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:59.720]   And I'm not buying the lie that I'm not wanted.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.720]   I'm staying with you.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.720]   Yeah, that's what we're asking for.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.720]   In Jesus' name.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:15.720]   (gentle music)
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.300]   (gentle music)
