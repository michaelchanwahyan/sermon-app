[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   [Music]
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   How we doing porch?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   It's so great to be back with you this evening.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Recently I took my family to Waco.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   My wife is from Waco.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   And so yeah, some of you are too.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   And so we went to Waco and there's this thing there called the BSR Cable Park.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   So it's like if you have ever been wakeboarding, there's these things called cable parks
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   where they like pull you around on a wakeboard on a cable.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   And there's also this thing there called the Royal Flush, okay.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   You probably have no idea what I'm talking about, but it's these crazy slides that like should be illegal, okay,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   because they shoot you up and just like launch you.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   And it's like some college kid is running.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I remember getting to the top of it looking down this really steep slide.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And somebody had just gone and I looked at him and I'm like, "Hey, can I go?"
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And he was like, "I don't care when you go."
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   I'm like, "Oh, okay, good. So it's safe."
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And it's just the craziest thing.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   And you go down this slide at like 600 miles an hour and then it shoots you up in like 50 feet in the air.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Like here's a picture.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Just okay, so that's the slide, right, and that's me.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And so it's just like the second you're going down it, it's like, "What did I just do?"
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And then it just launches you uncontrollably in the air and you're kind of like, "Oh, no."
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And so I thought I would take my five-year-old, my nine-year-old, and my seven-year-old.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   This is going to be fun.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   But I was so proud of them.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I was so proud of them because they all went down it.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   You know, I'm a proud dad.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   My daughter was like, "Man."
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   She got in the water, hit the water, was like, "I was not ready for that."
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And I was like, "I understand. I understand."
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   But my son, my son goes down the slide and he's headed down and he spreads his legs
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   and he grabs the side and he stops right in the middle of it.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And he's like, "No, I can't. I can't."
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I'm like, "Buddy, there's no turning back now. You got no options.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   There's no way off the slide, so you have to go down it."
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And just this idea that we were talking afterwards like, "Oh, man, I wasn't ready for that. I don't know."
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   It reminded me of this meme. Have you seen this meme?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   It says, "This is me sliding into adulthood."
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   See, I think that's like some of us, like life is just like, you know, there's kindergarten, first grade,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   second grade, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade, you know, then junior high, then high school, then college.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And then it's like all of a sudden, "Ahh!"
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   We're just kind of flailing, flying, you know, and flailing through the air.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   It's like, "I wasn't ready for this."
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And then what do you do? You're kind of like, "Okay, I don't like, like, is this the real world?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Like, I think I'm going to go back to college.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   You know, maybe I'll go back. Maybe grad school. That sounds pretty good right now."
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And then what you do, you're like, "Man, I don't know about this job.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Like, I think I got the wrong job, and I need to go find the right job."
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And so you begin to jump around, and you know, then you start thinking, "Maybe I need to move."
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   You get real philosophical. You ever done this? You're like, "What if I had a, you know, a hut on the beach,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   and I just surfed?"
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And it's like, "Have you ever surfed?" "No, but I bet I could.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I bet I'd be good."
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And maybe you're philanthropic or benevolent. You're like, "I don't know, maybe I'll move, you know, to a third world country and start an orphanage."
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And that's awesome, man. Good for you. Right?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   But it's like, "Is this, is this, is this the real world?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I wasn't ready for this."
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And so we're wrapping up our series asking for a friend, and,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   and the question I want to answer is,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   "How do I get ready for what's next?"
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   How do I get ready for the real world?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I was going to call it, "How do I adult like a boss?" But they were like, "No, don't do that."
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And then it was, "How to crush adulting." And they were like, "No."
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   So how to get ready for whatever's next.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I think for so many of us, what we need is to gain wisdom.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   The Bible talks a lot about getting wisdom.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Get it at all costs.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   In fact, Proverbs 4, 7 says, "The beginning of wisdom is this, get wisdom.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Though it cost all you have, get understanding."
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And I think so many of us, we want a mentor.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And I've talked to some of you, you're like, "Hey, who do you want to mentor?"
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   You know, a godly man? Yeah, a godly man. It would be cool if he was rich, really successful.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Could tell me how to find a great woman.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And so it's like we want someone who is wise.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And so tonight you're going to learn from someone who is very wise.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Not me.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   The wisest man who has ever lived.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Solomon. King Solomon.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   In 1 Kings, it says that Solomon had an opportunity to ask God for something.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And he said, "Who am I, just a boy?"
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Because God had favor on his father who was King David.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   And Solomon says, "Who am I, just a boy? How can I rule all these people?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Lord, would you give me wisdom? Would you give me discernment?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Help me to know right from wrong. Help me to lead your people."
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Then it says that the Lord was pleased with him.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And because he had asked for wisdom to lead the people,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   God also gave him riches.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And he gave him honor and he gave him fame.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And so this is who Solomon is.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   I want you to understand that as we think about how to get ready for whatever's next,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Solomon wrote a book called Wisdom.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   In fact, when I was younger, before I was a Christian, I said,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   "Hey, my dream job would be to have an advice line."
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Like 1-800-ASK-FOR-ADVICE.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And I would just sit there and give people advice all day.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I remember telling my friend this in college, like,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   "This would be my dream job, just to give advice."
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And kind of, I had my dream job, because what happens, you guys email in all the time,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   like, "Well, I'm dating this boy, and what would you do if..."
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And so I just kind of give advice all day.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   But you don't want my advice.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   When you can get wisdom from the Creator of the heavens and the earth,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   that's a much better place to get advice.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   And what's funny about that slide that I showed you up front is on YouTube,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   there's all these fail compilations.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Like people who've gone off that slide and landed on their head or their back or their stomach.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Like my family's probably on some of them.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And none of us want to get to the end of this life,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   and our life to be one big fail compilation.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Like none of you here tonight are like,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   "Man, when I grow up, I really hope I'm an alcoholic."
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   But some of you will be.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   You're not like, "Man, I really hope, you know, to give marriage a try a couple times,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   have a few divorces under my belt.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   That's what I'm dreaming for."
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   But statistically, that will be about half of your story.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Some of your stories already.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And I'm not trying to make you feel bad or give you shame.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I'm just saying the natural drift down the slide is toward ruin and destruction.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Like that's where we go if we don't gain wisdom.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   We drift toward negative outcomes that no one wants.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   No one's like, "Man, I really hope one day I'm a couple hundred thousand dollars in debt."
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And yet it happens all the time.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And it happens because of choices you make in your 20s and your 30s.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   And so I want to talk with you about how to get ready for what's next.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   And we get to gain wisdom from the wisest man in the world.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   I'll tell you just a little bit about this guy.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   He lived in 970 to 931 B.C.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   He was a king and not just a man of power.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   He was a king that other kings came to and paid for consulting.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   He was a rich man.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   When I say rich man, he earned the modern-day equivalent of a billion dollars a year.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   That's not net worth. That's income.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   A billion dollars a year.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   He would throw parties, like the most epic parties you can imagine.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   22,000 heads of cattle were on the menu for one of his parties.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   In addition to that, 150,000 sheep and goats.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   These are the kinds of parties that this man threw.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   And he had women.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   700 wives and 300 concubines or prostitutes.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Which you say, like some of the guys are like, "Well, he doesn't sound very wise."
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Because that's a lot of presents and roses and whatnot.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   But here's what you need to know.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   That was actually his downfall.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   It was a step in the wrong direction, his disobedience.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   And that's what brought him to ruin at some point in his life, was that poor choice.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And so he's a man of power. He's famous.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Everyone knew who he was. Everyone still does.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   You can go.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   His palace where he lived--talk about cribs--
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   where he lived took 13 years to build.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   He had over 30,000 employees.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   30,000 personal assistants.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   People that not work for his company, but worked for him personally.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Secular sites. You can go on secular websites.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And search "the richest man who has ever lived."
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And you will see people who reject the Bible as truth,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   acknowledge Solomon, who everyone would agree was a king in history.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   In fact, you can go to Bethlehem right now.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   About 5 kilometers southwest of Bethlehem,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   you're going to see what's called Solomon's Pools.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   They're still there.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   They were used to water his garden.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Don't think garden.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Think more amazing than any arboretum that you've ever been to.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Think forest with flowers.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   That's this guy.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   And so we're going to get to learn from him,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   because he wrote a book called Proverbs.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   It's most of his writings or things that he captured from other kings
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   and collected and put in a book of wisdom in the Scriptures.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   My preference would always be to teach a passage of the Bible,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   to highlight Jesus and present the gospel to you.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   But tonight's going to be a little different.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Tonight I'm going to teach through a book, verses.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Usually I teach how many points?
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Three points.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Tonight I'm going to teach ten.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   We're going to fly.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   It's going to feel kind of like a Chris Pratt speech.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   So stay with me drinking from a fire hydrant
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   as we look at ten pieces of wisdom
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   that will help you get ready for whatever is next.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   And the first one is this.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Pay attention to what you pay attention to.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Pay attention to what you pay attention to.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   That is, give careful thought to your thoughts.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   It says this in the Proverbs, chapter 14, verse 15.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   The simple believe anything, but the prudent give thought to their steps.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   It says in 14, verse 12, there is a way that seems right,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   but in the end it leads to death.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   You think it's the right way, but if you go that way,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   it's going to kill you.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   This is why I say this here.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   This is why this is important and it's number one on the list.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Because thoughts take you places.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Just by thinking, you can bring yourself to a place of panic,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   and anxiety, and unrest, just from your thoughts.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   A thought can get lodged in your head that will impact the direction you go.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   In fact, somebody said it like this.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Sow a thought, you reap an act. Sow an act, you reap a habit.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Sow a habit, you reap a character. Sow a character, and you reap a destiny.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   They're connecting your destiny to your thought in a moment.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Let me show you how this plays out.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   What I'd love you to do for just a minute, for just a few seconds,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   and campuses, you can do this too, wherever you're at.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   I'd love for everyone to close their eyes for just a minute.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Just close your eyes for just a minute.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Now let's just presume that every way would lead to death,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   any way you could go would lead to death, except north.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   If you go north, you'll live. I want everyone to point north.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Everyone point north.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Okay, now I want you to open your eyes and look around.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Campuses.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Here's what you need to know.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Here's what you need to know.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   None of you really pointed north.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   You may have maybe even pointed in the direction.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   You may have pointed in the direction of north, wherever you were, campuses, whatever.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   You may have pointed in the general direction, but none of you pointed north.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Some of you pointed straight up in the air, which is confusing to me.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   I don't know what to do with that, but let's talk afterwards.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   What I want you to know is what you think.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   It matters because it takes you places.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Right about now you think, "That's not a big deal
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   "because I have a compass on my phone.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   "I can pull out the compass, and it will tell me which way north is."
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   That's exactly right.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   What you use as a source of wisdom really matters
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   because it takes you places.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   So consider carefully what you pay attention to.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Number two, get out of debt and stay out.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Get out of debt and stay out.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Proverbs 22, verse 7 says, "The rich rule over the poor,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   "and the borrower is slave to the lender."
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Monica and I often get to do premarital counseling
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   where we meet with a couple who's about to get married.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   A lot of times what happens in that conversation
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   is we'll learn that one of them or both of them has debt,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   sometimes a lot of debt.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Maybe it's student loans and a car loan, and it's just compiled.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Maybe credit cards that they haven't paid off,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   and they get to this place, and they start to feel shame and guilt
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   because their debt is about to be their debt, collective.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   The other person, when you think about sharing all things in marriage,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   a lot of times you don't think about,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   "Oh, yeah, I'm going to start off $100,000 in the hole.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   "That's really the choice that I'm making."
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   I don't say that to make you feel shame.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   I say that so that you might consider
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   that now is the time for you to get out of debt.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   You think, "Man, there's no way I can."
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   I would say, "I've seen people do it."
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Here's how you do it.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   You live below your means, you give as much as you can,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   and you use all of the rest to pay bar tabs.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   No, debt.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Debt.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Cell phone bills. No, debt.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Consider your car. Can you drive a cheaper car?
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   When you get out of that debt, could you drive a cash car?
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   It never fails to surprise me
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   when someone has $100,000 in debt
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   and a brand-new 4Runner.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   It's always confusing to me as well.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Consider how you might get out of that debt.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   That's going to prepare you well for later.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   The third point that I want to give you from the book of wisdom
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   is to deal with addictions now.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Now is the time for you to deal with addictions.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Proverbs 11, verse 6 says,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   "The righteousness of the upright delivers them,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   "but the unfaithful are trapped by evil desires."
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   That's Proverbs 11, verse 6.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Let me explain to you what addictions are like.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Addictions are like you have--
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Anybody have a pet? A puppy or kitten or anything?
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Any bird owners?
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   We're a bird family. I see you. We got birds.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   It's like you have a pet lion.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   You love it, and it's cuddly, and it purrs when you pet it,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   and it comes up with its nose and nustles up against you.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   It's really cute. It makes this cute sound.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   You feed your lion. You love your lion.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   You feed him. He grows up, and he gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   All of a sudden Simba is king of the jungle.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   He's got the sharp teeth and everything.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   You were the master of the lion, but now the lion's master of you.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   At its will, it can devour you.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   But you can't kill the lion because it's your pet. You love him.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   You've grown to cohabitate with him.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   He's kind of become a part of you.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   You don't realize that any minute,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   he's going to eat you for lunch.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   So here's my question. What are you addicted to?
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   The people who are really bad off,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   they don't think they are addicted.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   It's the ones that are like, "Man, I know exactly what I'm addicted to.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Those I have hope for. They're probably going to get well."
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   It's the ones that don't realize that they are addicted to alcohol.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   They are addicted to money, to drugs, to pornography, to shopping.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Those are the ones that I am concerned about.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   The problem is, with the analogy of the lion,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   when you feed something, it grows. It gets bigger.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   So you think, "I can stop drinking anytime. It's not a problem.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Just one last time. I'm going to go out one last time."
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   What you're doing is you're feeding something.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   When you feed something, it grows.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   "I'm going to look at that one last time. I'm going to call him one last time.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   I'm going to go there one last time.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   I'm going to watch that one last time."
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   This is the lie of one last time.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   You just fed it a little food and it got bigger,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   so the next time is going to be harder, more difficult,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   because you grew an appetite for it.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   I've been doing this no sugar thing.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Yeah. Pray for me.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Ketogenics, anybody? Paleo, Whole30 people?
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Pray for them.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   So right off the bat, man, it's real hard.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   The cravings are uncontrollable.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   You walk by the bakery.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   I just went there for fun.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   You see the eclair, and they're just calling your name.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   It's so difficult. You couldn't sleep at night.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   I'm so hungry for dessert.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   We're a dessert family.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   I'm so hungry for dessert.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   But what happens, and I read about this,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   and I began to experience it,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   but if you stop eating for it, you sustain.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   The cravings go away.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   I never would have thought that happened,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   but the cravings went away.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   But I made a mistake.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   I ate one cookie,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   and it was just like I was starting all over.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   They were all right back on me.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   It took the same amount of time for them to go away.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   See, when you starve something,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   you feed something, it grows.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   You starve something, it dies.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   So starve addictions.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Now's the time to starve addictions.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Number four, make friends that make you better.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Make friends that make you better.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Walk with the wise and become wise,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   for a companion of fools suffers harm.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   It's Proverbs 13, verse 20.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   And so the reality is you are the average
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   of your five closest friends.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   You are the average of your five closest friends.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   So be careful who you choose as your favorites
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   in your phone, who your friends are.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Because maybe you think, yeah,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   but I can't just leave my friends.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   No, no, no, no, you can't just leave your faith.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   You can leave your friends.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   But the reality is your friends are gonna pull you down.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   So make friends that make you better.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Okay, like it's so much easier to pull someone down
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   than it is to pull them up, okay?
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   You get that?
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   It's so much easier to pull someone down
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   than it is to pull them up.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Come here for a second,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   if I can borrow you for just a minute.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   My man here.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   So I'm just gonna prove this point.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Pull you, no, no, you don't put your foot up there.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Help me.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Okay, now you pull me down.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   No, just pull me off here.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Okay, I didn't mean like that.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Wow, okay, you had to get violent.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Geez.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Get back up here, I'm back Fort Worth.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Ah, ah.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Point proven, okay?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   It's a lot easier to pull someone down
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   than it is to pull them up.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Okay, let me recover for a minute.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Pulled something.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Ah.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   And so I said this at launch,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   what some of you need to hear,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   change your playmates in your playground.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Change where you go for fun
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   and who you hang out with.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   But I can't just abandon my friends.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   No, you can't just abandon your faith.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Number five, inform your heart before you follow it.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Inform your heart before you follow it.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Talking about how you prepare for what's next in life.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Above all else, guard your heart
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   for everything you do flows from it.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   It's Proverbs 4, 23, okay?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   This is the lie of follow your heart.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Jeremiah tells us your heart is wicked and deceitful.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   It's beyond cure.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Who can trust it?
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   And yet we trust it.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And yet the Holy Spirit gives you a new heart.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Regeneration.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   You have God's spirit at work in your life.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   And so how do we reconcile those ideas?
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Here's how you reconcile.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Before you follow your heart, you inform your heart.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   You tell it where to go.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Your heart is like a bloodhound on a scent.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Do you understand the metaphor?
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   It's like you've given it a scent
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   and it's looking for the scent that you gave it, okay?
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   It's searching for more of what you've shown it,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   what you've listened to, what you've heard,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   what you've watched on TV,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   what you like, what your affections are.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   And so your heart is on that scent
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   and it's looking for that thing.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   And so let me change metaphors for a minute.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Like a GPS or a navigation system, right?
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   A navigation system is gonna take you somewhere.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   But you would never follow a navigation system
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   unless you put in the address.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Then you say, "Hey, this is where I want to go."
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Now is the time to tell your heart where you want to go.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   To feed it, to inform it,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   to let it feast on the word of God
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   so that it knows what to look for.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Because it's looking for what you're showing it.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   So if you're entertained by drama,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   it's looking for drama.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   You're like, "How come I can't find a good guy?"
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Because you've told your heart to look for a terrible guy.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   That's why.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   So what if you informed your heart better?
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Inform your heart before you follow it, right?
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   And I talked to a girl, they're like,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   "Man, I just can't get over my ex.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   "I don't know how I'm ever gonna get over my ex."
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Hey, let me give you some advice, okay?
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Stop looking at his Instagram feed, okay?
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Like how is it good for your heart
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   you seeing him with another girl?
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Like how is that a good idea?
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Of course you can't get over your ex.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   You're intentionally not letting your heart get over your ex.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   That's what you're doing, right?
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   And some of you are like, "Man, I hate being single.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   "I can't stand it.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   "I woke up, if I see another,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   "if I get invited to another wedding, I'm gonna..."
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   I'm not scared, I'm not scared.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   But that's because, I mean, you're listening to,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   you know, these love ballads, right?
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Selena Gomez telling you, "The heart wants what it wants."
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Stop doing that, okay?
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   You're watching the rom-coms, you're feeding your heart,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   you're just teaching yourself discontentment.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Comparison is the thief of joy.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   I'm not confused as to why you have no joy.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   All you do all day, every day is compare yourself.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Like, get rid of the Pinterest folder of wedding dresses.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   That's gonna help you.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   You're like, "No, do I have to?"
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Yes, you have to.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Number six, know what is evil and avoid it.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Know what is evil and avoid it.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Proverbs 8, verse 13 says,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   "To fear the Lord is to hate evil."
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   "I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech."
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   There's been something happening in our generation
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   I wanna make you aware of.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   There's a lot of talk around tolerance.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Let me read you the definition of tolerance from the dictionary.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   This is now labeled old tolerance
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   because the definition has changed on our watch,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   in our lifetime, old definition,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   "The ability or willingness to endure the existence of opinions
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   "or behavior that one dislikes or disagrees with,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   "to endure, the ability to endure someone
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   "that you disagree with,
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   "who thinks in a way that you disagree with."
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   But new tolerance says,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   new tolerance says, "Accepting different opinions as right."
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Now this is completely crazy.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   It is impossible for two people who believe opposites of each other
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   and they have to look at each other and say,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   "Yeah, we're both right."
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   When you can't both be right.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   This is a terrible definition of tolerance.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   In fact, we are intolerant to old tolerance,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   to what has always been tolerance
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   is what we've grown intolerant to.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   And so why tolerate something God hates?
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   And you say, "Because I love."
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   That's right, you should love.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   You should love.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   And love is always gonna be paired with truth and grace.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   And so don't tolerate evil, stand up against it courageously.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   If you see a racial injustice, I hope you speak up.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   If you see any kind of injustice,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   I hope you're the loudest voice in the room.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   And don't tolerate what God doesn't tolerate.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   The only thing necessary for evil to prevail
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   is for good people to do nothing.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   It's been well said.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   The only thing necessary for evil to prevail
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   is for good people to do nothing.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   And likewise, if a brother or sister in the faith
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   is bringing harm to themselves, help them.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   And so there's this other part,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   so let me just read the proverb to you again.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   It says, "To fear the Lord is to hate evil.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   "I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   "and perverse speech."
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   And so here's what I would say here.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Don't be entertained by what Christ died for.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   You hearing on that?
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Like I just went on the Billboard chart yesterday
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   and just looked at the top five songs,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   the number, that one, two, three, four, five songs.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   And like you wouldn't believe
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   how much I think Satan glories in those songs.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Like what they said is crazy.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   I'm talking about Nicki Minaj.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   I'm talking about Cardi B.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   I'm talking about Post Malone.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   I'm talking about 6ix9ine.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   And some of you are like, "No, not Post Malone.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   "No, man, that's my boy."
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Listen, I love the beat.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Can I tell you something?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Can I tell you something crazy?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   I love the beat.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Man, I love it.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   Like this brother's gifted, man.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   But I'm afraid that that's how I'm gonna have
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   to explain it to Jesus.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Like we're gonna be like, "Dude, what were you doing?"
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   "Well, Jesus, did you hear the beat?"
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   It was amazing.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   No, I mean, I know what he was on about,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   killing people and popping pills and calling girls.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   I know, but the beat, Jesus.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   I remember being at a party right after I had become
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   a Christian, I had new ears, you know,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   listening to everything through a new lens.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   And it was my favorite song.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   This was back in the day.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   It was "Fitty Cent."
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   And I had danced to this song like countless times.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Like loving, I was with some friends, we were dancing.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   And I just started listening to the words.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   I'm like, "Oh, oh, he's talking about raping women
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   "for profit and selling them and finding glory in that."
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   That's what I've been bobbing my head to.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   I never even realized.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   And I can only imagine how Satan just receives
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   that as worship.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Like just glories in that, man.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   It brings him so much gladness in his heart.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Number seven, identify idols and rid your life of them.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Identify idols and rid your life of them.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Keep falsehood and lies far from me.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Give me neither poverty nor riches,
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   but give me only my daily bread.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Otherwise I have too much and disown you and say,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   I might have too much and disown you and say,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   who is the Lord?
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Or I may become poor and still and so dishonor
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   the name of God.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   It's Proverbs 30, verses eight and nine.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   And so this is where Solomon ultimately missed it.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Where he married women who worshipped other gods,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   who led him to worship other gods.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   He followed them into worshipping other gods.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And so we think, hey, who has an idol?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   And you think, well, I don't have an idol.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   I don't have like a gold statue in my house
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   or a thing that I offer sacrifices to.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   But so many of us tonight are worshipping idols
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   and you've gotta hear this.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   And so it may be your work, okay.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   It could be what you do for a living.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   It could be working out.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   Like you love to work out and you're looking in the mirror
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   and you're obsessed with your body
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   and you're constantly trying to figure out
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   where your body fat is or whatever.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   It could be hobbies that you spend too much time doing.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   It could be a relationship or a phone
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   or it could be marriage.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Like I said, if you have that Pinterest folder,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   it could be marriage, right?
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   And you say, well, how do I know if it's an idol?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Well, does it control your emotions?
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Because whatever controls your emotions
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   is what you worship.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Whatever makes you happy and sad,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   that's an object of worship.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   And maybe an idol you need to smash.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   And so is God the most important thing in your life?
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   The only way I know to kill an idol
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   is to replace it with a greater idol.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   And so you learn to love God more than any other thing
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   that your heart is chasing.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   You feed your heart the things of God.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   That your heart would grow a taste for God
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   and love God above everything else.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Number eight, become smaller.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Become smaller.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Or realize you are.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Proverbs 16, verse 18 says,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   "Pride goes before destruction,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   "a haughty spirit before a fall."
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   So this is relevant to you.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Like if you ever walk into a room
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   and you wonder what everyone is thinking about you.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Do they like my shirt?
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Do they like my shoes?
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   What are they thinking about me?
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Can I give you just a tip here?
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   I'm gonna tell you what they're thinking.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   They're thinking, they're wondering
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   what you're thinking about them.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   That's what they're thinking, okay?
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   That's where their mind is.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   And so you can stop worrying
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   about what everybody's thinking about you.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Here's the truth about you.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   You may not like this,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   but you are unbelievably expendable.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   When you're gone, the world is gonna miss you
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   for just a moment.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   And then it's gonna move on.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   And that's the truth.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   But God loves you.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   And if you've trusted in Christ,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   he's prepared a place for you.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   But right now on this earth,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   you're one of 7.5 billion people.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   And you're special, don't get me wrong.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   You have infinite value.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   You've been created in the image of God.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   But you're special just like
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   the other 7.5 billion people are special.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Okay?
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   And it's just good to become small.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Because when you become big,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   all the weight of the world is on your shoulders
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   and that leads to panic and anxiety disorder
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   and everything else.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   But when you become small, it's just like, okay.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   It's like the pressure release valve.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   It's like everything is going to be okay.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   My five-year-old, we went out to eat Mexican food.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   And you know how some Mexican restaurants,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   they do it big.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   They got streamers and bright colors
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   and pinatas and sombreros
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   hanging from the ceiling and stuff.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   That was this Mexican restaurant.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Pinatas everywhere.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   And so my five-year-old walks in
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   and he's like, oh.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   And I'm like, why are you being weird?
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   What's going on?
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   And he's like, daddy, how did they know?
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   I'm like, how did they know what?
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   How did they know my birthday is in a week?
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   You know?
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   He's like, they did all this for me?
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   And it's cute when you're five,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   but not when you're 25.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Right?
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   You walk into a room and you think
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   everything's about you.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   It's not.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   It's not.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   You got a cameo in this movie
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   that's all about Jesus.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And you're on the screen for about five seconds.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   And that's the truth.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   So live for him.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Number nine, practice patience.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Practice patience.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   The wise store up choice food and olive oil,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   but fools gulp theirs down.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   This is Proverbs 21, verse 20.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   You may have heard good things come to those who wait.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   I don't know if good things come to those who wait.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   I know that most good things come through waiting.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   That most things that are good are worth waiting for.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   It's something called delayed gratification.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   You need to learn it.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   You need to know it.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   You need to live by it.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   You need to deprive your flesh of instant pleasure
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   in the moment so that you can have something greater.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   There's this story in Genesis chapter 25
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   where two brothers, Jacob and Esau,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Esau comes home from hunting and he's hungry
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   and Jacob has a bowl of stew.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   And he says, "Give me that stew.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   "I'm starving to death."
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   And Jacob says, "Oh yeah?
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   "Well, I will give you some stew for your birthright."
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   At this time, a birthright means an inheritance.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   It means rights.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   It means you're your father's boy.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   It comes with a lot of things.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   But because he's hungry, he says,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   "What do I care about my birthright?
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   "I'm hungry."
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   And he trades his birthright for a cup of stew
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   because he can't wait to eat.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Because he really wants something.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Here's what I draw from that message.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Trust yourself the least
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   when you really, really want something.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   That is when you are the most untrustworthy.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Trust yourself the least
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   when you really want to treat yourself.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Trust yourself the least
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   when you really want to treat yourself.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   The sad truth of it is that most of you
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   will never experience the intimacy
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   that God desires for you
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   because you've traded it for sex.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   What dogs do on the side of the road.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And you will never experience the intimacy
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   as God intended.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   And you say, "Well, why would you give us
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   "such a hopeless message?"
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   No, it's not hopeless.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Because I'm not saying it's not available to you.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Okay?
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   But I'm saying it comes through waiting and healing
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   and a long season of patience
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   that a lot of you won't take the time to endure.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   It downs the time.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   To learn to not follow your flesh
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   or follow your heart
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   or do what feels good in a moment.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   And number 10, and this one helps with all the other ones.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Learn to love accountability and ask for it.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Learn to love accountability and ask for it.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Proverbs 12, verse one says,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   "Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   "but whoever hates correction is stupid."
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   And this one could be, "Don't be stupid."
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   There's this place in the Bible where God says,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   "Hey, this is what stupid people do.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   "They hate correction."
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   And so you don't want to go at this alone.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   So here's what you might do.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   You might look back past those other one through nine
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   and find the one that's most relevant to you.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   And you may text your community group right now
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   and say, "Hey, let's talk about this one.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   "This is my area of struggle.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   "I want you guys or girls praying for me in this area.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   "I want you waging war with me in this area.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   "I want you asking me about this on a weekly basis.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   "Ask me if I'm lying to you,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   "and then ask me if I'm lying to you about lying to you
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   "so that I could be free
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   "and I could have the life that God desires for me
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   "and that I'd be ready for whatever's next."
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Some of you have jumped in a community group
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   and when it's hard, you jump out.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Can I tell you something?
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Community is not found, it's forged.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   It's not found, it's fought for.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   I got in a community group 16 years ago,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   potluck, didn't choose the guys and didn't like any of them,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   didn't have anything in common with any of them, okay?
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   And I thought, "Hey, I'll never go back."
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   But by the grace of God, the one thing I did right
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   in a season where I did a lot of things wrong is I went back.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   And I kept going back every Thursday night.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   And I look back on that, and this is not an exaggeration.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   I say it all the time.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   God used that group of men more than any other thing
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   to devour my life and to make me love him
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   and to sanctify me, to call me into ministry,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   to heal my marriage, to rid my life of my porn addiction,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   to deal with my struggles.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   He used those men that I didn't even like.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   And I'm still running, I still run with the same men.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   We've added others to the group.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   Shane B is in my group.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   John Elmore is in my group.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   God, these guys that hold me accountable every single week.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   I texted them something last night.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   "Hey, would you pray for me?"
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   This is something I just accidentally saw on my phone.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   "Would you pray for me?"
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And so now is the time to get wisdom.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   Now is the time to train for tomorrow's challenges.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   None of us want our life to look like a fail compilation.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   None of us want that.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   But, you know, it's funny because when we were at that park,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   that cable park, there were guys, there was this guy
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   that went down off in front of me,
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   and he went off that slide.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   He didn't look like I did.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   He did three flips and then dove.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   I'm like, "Dude, how'd he do that?"
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   Here's what I know about that guy.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   That wasn't his first time.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   That guy trained for that. He had practice.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   And so it's different.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Like when you think about athletes, right?
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Athletes train for an event.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   You would never just walk on at the Olympics
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   at an event you've never done before
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   because those guys have trained their whole lives for that.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   There's this idea that everything adds up,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   that every moment is training for a future moment.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   Here's the reality.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   You're all becoming something.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Write that down.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   You're all becoming something.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   Listen, you want to be a good mom and a good wife
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   or a good dad and a good husband?
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   Good moms and good wives don't just happen.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   They don't just choose one day,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   "Hey, I know that I've been unfaithful my entire life,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   "and I've been promiscuous in my thoughts and my actions,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   "but now I'm going to be a great wife."
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Life doesn't work that way.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Okay?
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   "I don't like kids. I've never babysat.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   "I don't even enjoy being around children,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   "but I'm going to be a great mom."
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   No, you're not.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Okay?
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   No, it's something that happens when you're 18,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   when you're 22, when you're 33,
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   and you begin to pursue wisdom.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   None of us would just walk on in the Olympics.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Every moment is training for a future moment.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Everybody's becoming something.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   Let me show you a video of Louis Vito
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   that paints this picture, a snowboarder.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Would you watch this?
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   Louis Vito didn't learn to snowboard
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   by walking on at the Olympics, the X Games.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   He learned to snowboard when he got one for Christmas
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   when he was three years old,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   and when he was in martial arts,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   and jumping on the trampoline when he was 16,
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   and when he was skateboarding to school,
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   and when he was spending hours and hours and hours
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   and hours on the mountains.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   Right now, you are preparing for who you will be.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   That's the truth.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   That's the reality.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Can I tell you something really important?
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   If you don't know Jesus,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   the dumbest thing you could do is take this advice
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   and try to avoid ruin in your life
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   only to land in a place of eternal destruction.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   The smartest advice that you could take right now
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   is to trust that Christ has died for your sins
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   and that God has raised him from the dead
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   and to live for him.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   But if you call yourself a Christian,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   if you say, "Hey, I'm a Christian,"
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   would you just start living like a Christian?
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   If you say, "Hey, I believe in God,"
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   would you just start believing in God,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   trusting in God?
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Small steps of faithfulness lead to faithful walks.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   Faithful walks with Jesus start with one foot
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   in front of the other,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   long obedience in the same direction,
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   trusting and obeying.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   Father, thank you for these friends
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   and for their desires to walk with you in faithfulness.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Father, would you heal their hurts?
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Father, would you heal their addictions?
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Would you help them to have friends
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   that can hold them accountable?
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   Would you guide them in the path of life?
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   Help them not to go the way that seems right
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   but in the end leads to death?
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   Father, would you help prepare them for whatever's next?
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Help them to be faithful today.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Lord, we love you so much.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   We're thankful for your son, Jesus.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   It's in his name we pray.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   Amen.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
