[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:22.180]   - Oh yeah, how we doing?
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.020]   Dallas?
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.320]   Anybody here from Fort Worth?
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.640]   Anybody here from Fort Worth?
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.740]   Come on.
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.160]   You know there's about 500, 400, 500
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.940]   folks gathered in Fort Worth right now too,
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.780]   so that's fun.
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.840]   Greetings Fort Worth, we're glad you're tuning in.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.240]   Love what God is doing over there.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.920]   Grateful for Garrett and his leadership
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.680]   and y'all's volunteers out there.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.200]   It's fun to be back with you guys.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.840]   Everybody watch the Super Bowl?
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.260]   That's fun.
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.920]   All right, it's got a mixed emotions.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.220]   I even heard some no's, which I'm sorry for you.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.680]   My family's been sick, okay?
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.000]   If somebody's sick in our family,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.520]   that means the whole family goes down eventually.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.680]   They like, the kids are in school,
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.880]   you know, the little ones in childcare sometimes,
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.880]   they just kind of pass infectious diseases
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.760]   out like playing cards, okay?
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.000]   Like baseball cards, they just trade that back and forth.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.440]   Probably not infectious diseases,
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.600]   but I don't, the right word escapes me right now.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.200]   So sickness, illnesses.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.160]   And so, family goes down with a stomach bug,
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.440]   comes back, bounces back.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.960]   Weston's down, they've all got this kind of flu-like cold,
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.680]   kind of severe cough.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.880]   I haven't gone down yet, praise God.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.240]   And so like, I've been talking to my wife,
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.720]   I'm like, I tell her the other night,
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.560]   I'm like, hey, I don't wanna be selfish,
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.640]   but can you not breathe on me?
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.880]   Like, can you sleep the other way?
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.280]   And roll, you know, turn the other way,
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.720]   because man, I just, I don't wanna,
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.920]   I'm trying not to get sick.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.500]   And so Super Bowl came, and so Finley and I
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.740]   were the only healthy ones,
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.160]   'cause she kind of had bounced back
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.320]   and the other three were down.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.440]   And we had a kind of a Super Bowl/birthday party to go to,
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.640]   and so I just said, hey, I'll take Finley,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.320]   she and I will go and we'll have a great time.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.400]   And so Monica just said, hey, that's cool,
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.400]   can you be back by seven?
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.280]   And I'm like, yeah, yeah, I'll be,
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.800]   'cause school's the next day, you know,
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.040]   bedtimes are a big deal right now
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.040]   and this season we're in, and so I'm like,
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.240]   yeah, I'll be back by seven.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.640]   Well, I don't know if you watch the Super Bowl,
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.760]   you remember that right around seven o'clock,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.400]   that was that epic kind of 80-yard and 29-seconds run
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.360]   for the Seahawks to tie the game going into halftime.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.160]   And so like that's seven o'clock, I'm like,
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.320]   okay, I can't leave right now, you know, of course.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.480]   And then halftime rolls around,
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.040]   and I didn't know who was performing at the halftime,
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.800]   so I was like, I can't leave right now.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.840]   And you know, then there was like 10 minutes
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.080]   of commentators, which would have been a great time to leave,
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.960]   but I didn't know that's what was gonna happen.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.640]   And so then the halftime starts,
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.720]   and I'm like, okay, I can't leave right now.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.320]   She texts me, she's like, hey, you're on your way, right?
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.040]   I'm like, right, Finley, let's go.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.560]   And so we get in the car, we go home, and I walk in,
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.960]   and she's so, my wife is amazing, she's so gracious.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.040]   And she just says, she asked me when Finley and I walk in,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.400]   she goes, hey, you know, man,
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.520]   what happened to that seven o'clock thing?
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.680]   I thought you were gonna be home by seven.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.240]   We know we gotta get Finley bathed and to bed.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.720]   And so I, you know, I'm like, well, listen,
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.840]   I've got a great reason, okay, here's the deal.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.240]   It was Katy Perry, it was a big lion.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.120]   I mean, there's guys moving the legs.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.480]   I didn't know if it was gonna turn around,
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.760]   and like, you know, I didn't know what was gonna happen.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.760]   And then, you know, I'm there,
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.920]   and then there were some sharks and palm trees
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.120]   and men dressed up, and I mean, like,
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.800]   who can leave at a time like that?
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.600]   And then I get home and I find out I missed Missy Elliott,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.840]   you know, and I'm like, it's your fifidififuenet,
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.480]   you know, and she's like, what?
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.560]   She's like, what did you say?
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.680]   I'm like, your fifidifufuenet, Missy Elliott, you know?
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.520]   And because of the seven, I mean,
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.040]   I didn't even get to see it.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.080]   And I'd love a flip it and reverse it on that.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.400]   I'd love to do that over,
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.440]   because, because here's why,
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.600]   because the little ones were there,
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.520]   and they were watching,
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.680]   and they learned a really important lesson.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.240]   They learned that, you know, as long as
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.880]   you don't wanna miss out on something,
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.760]   you can flake out on your commitment.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.120]   It doesn't really matter what you said,
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.520]   as long as you have a reason,
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.960]   as long as you can explain it away,
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.880]   it's okay that you didn't do what you said
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.160]   that you were going to do.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.720]   And that's what happens for us, I think.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.880]   It's an epidemic, really.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.040]   They're saying in our generation among millennials,
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.680]   and Gen Y, if that's you, if you're here,
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.560]   and they're saying we're the flakiest demographic
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.480]   generation ever to walk the planet,
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.720]   the most non-committal.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.040]   And the scripture says a whole lot about this,
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.840]   and so first, let me just kind of make a case
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.680]   from statistics about why we are afraid
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.920]   of missing out on something,
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.800]   and therefore we don't commit.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.560]   We don't commit in relationships.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.600]   The US adult marriage rate is at an all-time low
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.760]   in our generation, 51%.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.680]   That's compared with 72% in 1960.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.880]   Today, just 20% of adults ages 18 to 29,
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.120]   that's a lot of us, are married.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.960]   Only 20% compared to 59% in 1960.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.600]   I love this one.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.960]   This is in Time Magazine, just July 2014.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.680]   43% of millennials said they would vote for marriage
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.080]   to be performed on a temporary two-year trial period.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.560]   43%, almost half of our peers said,
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.880]   "Hey, we don't want marriage to be permanent.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.080]   "Can we just kind of have a try before you buy season?"
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.520]   And everybody gasped, and everybody said,
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.120]   "What, that's crazy."
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.000]   But you know what, we date like that.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.200]   Don't we date like that?
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.440]   We come up with new categories of dating,
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.080]   and then seriously dating, cohabitating.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.240]   And it's like, well, no, we don't wanna redefine
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.000]   God's institution of marriage.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.880]   We don't want a two-year trial period,
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.040]   but we'll try before the altar.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.400]   I mean, we'll pretend.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.880]   And careers, millennials stay only two years at a job
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.720]   compared to baby boomers who average seven years
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.000]   and Gen Xers who average five years.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.600]   And then church, something relevant to us here.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.800]   Three out of five millennial Christians, that's 59%,
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.640]   disconnect either permanently or for an extended period
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.800]   of time from church after the age of 15.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.840]   Over half leave the church.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.480]   And each year, one out of seven adults changes
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.840]   his or her church membership, while one out of six
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.400]   rotates between different churches.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.200]   So then I'll take a little Piper, little Chandler,
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.240]   little Wagner, just, hey, who's hot right now?
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.560]   Who has the best worship leader?
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.720]   I'm gonna go here this Sunday, there the next Sunday.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.160]   Where can I consume from?
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.440]   And here's why this matters,
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.160]   and why this message is so important,
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.280]   because the greatest things in life require a commitment.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.040]   You think about all the things you want right now.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.040]   Love, careers, a relationship with Jesus.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.920]   All of this requires a commitment.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.200]   Let's just say somebody comes up to you and you're like,
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.160]   hey man, do you have a faith?
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160]   And they're like, yeah, I'm a Christian.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.920]   Yeah, I'm a Christian, because that's in Dallas,
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.940]   that's common, yeah, I'm a Christian.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.200]   Because we have to check a box,
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.000]   so that one, I'm mostly a Christian.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.720]   Check that box, and then you ask 'em,
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.000]   and you say, okay, well, check this out, listen,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   do you read the Bible?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.080]   Yeah, I mean, I did, I read it last month,
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.160]   I've read some of it before, I've heard of the Bible.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.400]   I can spell Bible.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.160]   Do you, are you a member of a church?
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.840]   No, but I mean, I go, Christmas and Easter,
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.400]   and I go to the porch sometimes on Tuesdays,
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.640]   and I mean, I go to church sometimes.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.600]   I mean, I've been to fellowship, I've been to the village.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.200]   Man, I've seen Watermark, IBC, First Baptist,
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.720]   I've been to those places.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.000]   Oh, okay, prayer life, I pray sometimes.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.760]   Wait, hold on, wait, I'm confused.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.460]   Why do you say you're a Christian?
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.360]   What makes you think you're a Christian?
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.080]   Well, I mean, my parents were Christians.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.580]   Okay, that's cool.
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.800]   My parents were teachers.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.840]   Okay, you know?
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.040]   Well, I mean, well, in the sixth grade,
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.100]   I prayed this prayer at camp.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.760]   Oh, you mean you made a commitment to Christ?
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.760]   Yeah, you made a commitment to follow Christ?
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.560]   Yeah, did you follow Christ?
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.000]   You still following Christ?
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.320]   Can we talk about that?
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.100]   Tonight, we're talking, as we move through this series,
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.300]   Missing Out, we're talking about commitment.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.880]   And the things that we need to commit to
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.360]   as followers of Jesus, and I'm afraid
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.860]   that we don't commit to 'cause we're afraid
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.800]   of what we're gonna miss out on,
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.360]   and the reality of it is,
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.880]   it is because we're not committing, we're missing out on.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.160]   Like, because we haven't committed to particular things
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.040]   that God has called us to, you are,
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.320]   and I'm promising you, I'm telling you,
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.120]   I'm pleading with you to listen with open ears.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.940]   Like, check your ego at the door.
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.660]   You came in, you don't trust authority,
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.800]   or you're thinking, man, how do you know better than me?
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.920]   I'm just gonna read from the Scriptures,
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.000]   and I'm telling you, you are missing out
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.540]   on God's best for you.
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.300]   Because you're missing out on some key commitments.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.900]   And I've taught on commitment once before in Generation Y,
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.740]   and if you didn't hear that, I'd encourage you to listen.
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.500]   Every volunteer that serves at the porch
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.460]   has to listen to that message before they serve with us,
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.420]   and there, I talk about keeping commitments.
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.680]   Tonight, I'm going to talk more about making commitments
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.140]   as we move through this series, Missing Out.
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.540]   And so, I'ma think,
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.980]   you know, where to start tonight,
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.860]   or where we'll go is why we don't commit,
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.620]   how we can commit, and why it matters.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.980]   And I'm gonna go back to the basics,
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.340]   basically, where we started last week is in Genesis.
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.300]   So I'll be in Genesis 2 and 3,
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.660]   and I just wanna show you what happened in the beginning.
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.300]   It's going to be a little philosophical,
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.640]   so follow closely with me.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.660]   I'll try to spell this out as simply as I can,
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.500]   but there's something really key that happened
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.100]   right at the beginning of the Bible.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.980]   That has redefined our understanding of commitment.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.160]   And so, in the beginning, we know there's God, the creator.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.760]   There's a God, that's the reality.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.540]   We're not him, he's there, he exists.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.700]   He's alive and active and involved in our lives,
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.820]   and he created, he created by speaking
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.180]   the world into existence.
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.760]   He said it, it was, and it was good.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.180]   The scripture says over and over,
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.380]   "He made light and land and sky and sea
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.620]   "and then animals and then man and woman."
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.420]   And he placed man and woman, Adam and Eve,
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.860]   in the garden, perfection.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.540]   They had a relationship with him.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.740]   They talked to him.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.180]   They fellowshiped with God, the creator
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.500]   of the heavens and the earth.
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.880]   They had a relationship with him
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.580]   that you and I don't know today.
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.640]   It was a perfect one.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.560]   They communed together, and there they were,
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.160]   and God says this, in perfection,
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.540]   and the Lord commanded the man,
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.600]   "You are free," this is verse 16, Genesis 2,
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.760]   "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden,
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.820]   "but you must not eat from the tree
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.860]   "of the knowledge of good and evil,
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:27.060]   "for when you eat from it, you will certainly die."
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.260]   Now, in the do not do this, this is where FOMO happens.
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.100]   Okay, fear of missing out happens in the do not,
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.660]   because any time we can't do something,
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.660]   we're like, well, why, why can't we?
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.740]   What, what's the Lord withholding from me?
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.940]   And this is Satan's playground, the do not,
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.620]   because we think God's holding something from,
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.180]   well, do not have sex before marriage.
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.500]   Like, really, like, what?
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.060]   I don't understand, well, I'm married in God's eyes.
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:50.900]   Well, what if?
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.700]   And I don't understand, what if we're going to get married?
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.340]   Well, is it really that big of a deal?
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.940]   In the do not, this is where the enemy plays,
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.820]   and we see that in Genesis 3, verse five.
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.560]   This is Satan talking to Eve.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.540]   "For God knows that when you eat from it,
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.500]   "your eyes will be opened,
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.380]   "and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.740]   Here's what he did, FOMO, he used FOMO to cause the fall.
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.320]   He said, hey, Eve, listen, you're missing out on something.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.880]   In that tree, that one that God said don't eat from,
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.620]   there's something good there that God's withholding from you.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.920]   And in fact, if you eat it, you'll be like him.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.780]   You'll know the difference between good and evil.
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.420]   You know what's really interesting about that?
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.700]   I wanna show you something
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.660]   that maybe you've never noticed before.
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.420]   Satan wasn't lying.
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.160]   What he said was actually true.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.560]   He said if you eat from it,
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.720]   you're gonna know the difference between good and evil.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.000]   You're going to be like God.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.380]   You know what happened when they ate from it?
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.000]   They were like God in the sense that they knew
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.320]   the difference between good and evil,
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.600]   or they knew of an evil that they didn't know of
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.360]   before they ate it.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.360]   They didn't see it.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.840]   I'm gonna show you this from the Scriptures.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.160]   And so my first point this evening
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.480]   is why we fear commitments.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.280]   I'm gonna give you three reasons why we fear commitment.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.680]   Number one, we're afraid of what we will miss out on
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.540]   by committing.
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.800]   The first reason we are afraid of commitment
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.360]   is 'cause we're afraid of what we'll miss out on
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.600]   if we commit.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.080]   And FOMO actually started,
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.340]   they tracked it back down to Harvard Business School.
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.800]   It started as FOBO, fear of better option.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.200]   I'm afraid that something better is going to come along,
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.280]   and therefore I wanna keep my options open and not commit.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.420]   This is very relevant to us in the life stage
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.640]   that many of us are in this evening.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.620]   And I want you to know that the most evil act
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:50.080]   in the history of the entire world was caused by FOMO.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.160]   And the consequences of this act, the fall,
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.800]   Eve and Adam doing the thing that God told them not to do
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.240]   was an awareness of evil existing.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.280]   And so now commitment has been redefined,
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.120]   and I'm gonna explain this.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.200]   But verse six says this.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.800]   When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.760]   was good for food and pleasing to the eye
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.840]   and also desirable for gaining wisdom,
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.480]   she began to feel like she was missing out on something.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.880]   And so she took some of it and ate it.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.400]   And she also gave some to her husband who was with her,
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.460]   and he ate it.
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.420]   Then the eyes, now this is what happened,
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.060]   the eyes of both of them were opened,
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.640]   just like Satan said they would be,
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.840]   and they realized they were naked.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.360]   They say I say that funny.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.400]   Naked.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.620]   Is that better, naked?
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.960]   Naked, all right, I'm working.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.240]   So they sewed fig leaves together
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.200]   and made coverings for themselves.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.040]   So death enters the world because of FOMO,
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.560]   but the immediate consequences
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.840]   were really a greater understanding
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.940]   of the reality they lived in.
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:47.780]   Here's what I mean.
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:48.960]   They were already naked.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.400]   They were already naked, right?
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.720]   One minute they're naked,
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.080]   and the next minute they realize they're naked.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:59.120]   And shame is surrounding the situation
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.580]   that they were already in.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.620]   And here's why that's important.
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:08.620]   Because sin entered the world through this man,
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.120]   now commitment, the thing we're talking about tonight,
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.040]   as we understand it, is not the commitment
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.800]   as God has wanted it to be.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.720]   It's not the commitment that he defined for us.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:26.360]   And so we now see commitment through the broken lens of sin.
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.260]   Let me explain.
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.480]   God made marriage to be permanent,
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.760]   but no one here knows that marriage.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.120]   Marriage, the only marriage you know
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.160]   is the one that can end.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.240]   You don't know of a permanent marriage.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.240]   And you might say, "No, no, no, I know somebody
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.200]   "that's been married."
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.840]   No, no, I'm not saying you haven't seen an example
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.120]   of a permanent marriage.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.280]   I'm saying that God made marriage,
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.200]   like as he defined it, it could not be broken.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.640]   And we took something that could not be broken,
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.120]   and we broke it, and now we can't unlearn
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.540]   that it can be broken.
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.560]   Okay, let me explain.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.720]   This is important, this is the philosophical part.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.800]   I've got a swing in my yard.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.640]   My kids love it.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.040]   It's a rope swing, and it's got this little wooden disc
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.840]   that hangs down, and I took a rope,
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.720]   hung it from the limb, and then tied a knot
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.440]   under the hole in the board, and so they get it.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.680]   And they are so trusting of this swing.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.960]   I mean, they'll run and jump as high as they can,
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.640]   and just grab it, and then sit on it,
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.480]   and they'll swing, and then they'll push each other,
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.160]   and you know, all the while, and there's this like,
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.120]   these bricks underneath them that I'm always afraid
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.000]   it's gonna fall, but they're like, "It's permanent.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:33.900]   "It's unbreakable.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.080]   "Daddy made it, it's perfect."
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.080]   And one day it fell.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:42.320]   The knot slipped through the hole, and the swing fell down.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.360]   And so that thing that they thought was unbreakable,
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.480]   now they can't unlearn that it's breakable.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.400]   And so they approach the swing with fear and trepidation.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.600]   They approach the swing with a greater concern.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.760]   They approach the swing knowing of what it's capable of.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.080]   See also how you approach marriage.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.180]   When God said, "No, no, you find someone,
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.720]   "you commit to them for a lifetime, it's unbreakable."
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.080]   And you're like, "No, I can't learn.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.080]   "I can't unlearn that that's not unbreakable.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.720]   "All I've seen is breakable."
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.360]   It's not all your fault.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.560]   Okay, this is not your fault.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.600]   I mean, it's your problem.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.820]   We've gotta redeem this, we've gotta change this,
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:27.920]   but this, you know, this is what our parents did to us.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.080]   This is what our grandparents did to us
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.880]   when they introduced divorce.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.200]   It's not your mistake.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:37.040]   But we've gotta redefine it as God intended for it to be.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.640]   Sex, when God invented sex, because he did,
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.240]   it was his idea, it was such a great idea, God, way to go.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.600]   He made the parts, he made 'em work the way they do,
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.920]   he made it feel the way it does,
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.040]   and he says this is permanent.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.120]   The scripture says, "For this reason,
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.140]   "a man will leave his father and mother
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:54.980]   "and be united to his wife,
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.320]   "and the two will become one flesh.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.880]   "There will be a mingling of souls that happens.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.140]   "Two people will become one person forever
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.280]   "and ever and ever."
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.180]   We don't know that sex.
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.800]   No one in this room, no one on the planet knows that sex.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.280]   You say, "No, no, no, bro, I'm a virgin."
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.680]   It doesn't matter.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.080]   You grew up in a world where that sex has been redefined.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.040]   Through magazines and media,
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.160]   you don't know of a permanent sex.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.020]   You only know of a temporary sex,
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.320]   a sex that happens for the pursuit of pleasure,
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.200]   not for the pursuit of permanence.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.120]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.580]   This is all because of the lens
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.640]   that we see commitment through because of the fall.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.200]   So any time in America's history,
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:49.080]   any time looking backwards, guys, this is crazy.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.940]   People got married younger and marriages last longer.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:19:01.420]   We are the worst at marriage than anyone who ever has been.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.340]   We get married later and our marriages
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.860]   don't last as long as they used to.
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.660]   Why?
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.140]   Crazy answer, this is the philosophical part.
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.180]   Information.
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.240]   That's why.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.800]   What happened when her eyes were opened
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.560]   and now she had a greater knowledge that she was naked
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.780]   and she felt shame?
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:29.800]   We have a greater knowledge that marriages can break up
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.700]   and so what do we do?
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.600]   We're like, we gotta find the one.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.140]   We gotta make it work.
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.440]   We gotta find the one where, you know,
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.960]   this thing is so fragile, it's so temporary,
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.340]   it can easily break, so we gotta find the right one
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.780]   so we can be with them forever
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.060]   and it's not about just finding the one,
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.780]   it's about finding a one who loves God
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.380]   and meets all of the things that he says they should be
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.380]   and committing to them and I promise
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.660]   you're gonna fall out of love with them,
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.100]   you're not gonna wanna be with them,
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.400]   there's gonna be times where they disgust you
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.580]   and you say, but I said until death do us part,
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.660]   richer or poorer, sickness and health,
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.740]   when I don't even feel in love with you,
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.060]   I'm committed to you
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:15.560]   because you will feel that way, I promise.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.220]   Everybody else is sleeping, one person's like,
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.020]   oh man, I'm awake, I'm awake.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.420]   Thanks, thanks mom, glad you're here.
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.420]   [audience laughing]
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:32.820]   God designed us to belong to his body, the church,
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.700]   but let's be honest, we've seen church leaders
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:41.340]   fail miserably, we've seen them commit adultery,
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.820]   we've seen them caught in pornography,
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.920]   even child pornography, we've seen them
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.360]   be the biggest hypocrites of the biggest kind
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.900]   and we've seen the church fall
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.820]   and we've been a part of imperfect churches
[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.700]   that have abused us and used us and take advantage of us
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.120]   and taken us for granted and so what do we say?
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.340]   We're like, hey, I don't need the institution,
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.540]   the church exists to make some people rich,
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.780]   I've seen this guy on TV, he's a joke
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.020]   and so I don't need to be a part of that,
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:11.800]   I can kinda have my own church, man, I'm a Christian
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.580]   and we've redefined the commitment to the church
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.260]   because of our own bad experiences through humans
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.420]   and I promise you, you're human
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.980]   and your church leaders are human
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.140]   and as an imperfect human, you don't want a perfect church
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.940]   'cause if you found it and you went there, you'd ruin it
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.940]   because you're imperfect and Christ is in the process
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.820]   of perfecting us through sanctification to glorification,
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.740]   that's his work, not ours and because it's imperfect,
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.560]   it doesn't mean you shouldn't commit to it,
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:48.140]   you should go all in, man, all in.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:53.140]   And so why have we gotten worse at marriage
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:59.780]   and church attendance and career choices?
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.140]   Because we've given ourselves too many options,
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.540]   that's the second thing, first reason is 'cause we're afraid
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.980]   of what we'll miss out on, the second one is
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.340]   because we've given ourselves too many options.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:14.080]   There's now a sense that you might marry the wrong person,
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.680]   in Jesus' day, you had limited options, you know?
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.640]   Your dad would show up and be like, hey, this is your husband
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.740]   and you'd be like, okay, I got one option.
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.040]   [congregation laughing]
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.900]   And we love variety even in churches.
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.700]   I don't really want the same pastor week after week
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.360]   after week, I want a variety, I want the best,
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.640]   like where's the teaching the best,
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.080]   where's the most entertaining, where's the funniest,
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.240]   where's the worship really good?
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.160]   And we approach church like a buffet,
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.980]   like in Jesus' day, it was like you would show up,
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.800]   you'd go to the church that existed in your city,
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.880]   the church of Colossae, the church of Thessalonica,
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.000]   the church of Philippi, the church of Rome,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.420]   and you'd pray not to die.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.520]   Like it was a good day if none of your friends
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.520]   got set on fire, like that was a win.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.800]   Hey, let's gather and let's learn the word of God
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.960]   because we may not have it tomorrow.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.800]   Let's feast and celebrate what Jesus has done for us.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.840]   And you weren't a consumer, you were a contributor
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.960]   in the very, every essence of the word.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.240]   Too many options for jobs.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.120]   Your great-grandfather was a farmer
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:21.240]   'cause his dad was a farmer and his dad was a farmer.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.080]   Here's what your great-great-grandfather never did,
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.080]   he never was like, hey man, I need to take Myers-Briggs
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.580]   and find out what I'm good at.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.880]   [congregation laughing]
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.560]   I read this book called Strengths Finder
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.200]   and man, I really think, I got the gift of woo
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.480]   and I think I could be, do this thing over here
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.560]   and what are my options?
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.280]   I'm gonna go on monster.com and really see
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.480]   what's available to me.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.980]   No, he never did that.
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.960]   He's like, I'm a farmer.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.280]   He never was like, well, where do my passions intersect
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.200]   the greatest need and where's the overlap
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.640]   and let me contribute there.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:55.000]   No, he just did the job that was in front of him
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.640]   really well to the glory of God.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.820]   That's a new problem.
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.320]   All of those things I said, they're funny
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.920]   'cause you heard 'em, you said 'em.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.920]   People said 'em to you.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.880]   But the Bible says you do the job that's in front of you
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.840]   and you do it well to the glory of God.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.720]   [congregation laughing]
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.920]   Here's a legit study.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.720]   This was in Time Magazine.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.560]   It was completed by the Columbia University
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.040]   and I just find it interesting.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.480]   Here's what happened.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.800]   They found that even in simple purchases
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   like the purchase of jams, jelly, if you will,
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.400]   that you were less likely to buy
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.240]   if you had too many options.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.960]   And so what they did in this case study
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.960]   is they had two stores and they arranged
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.320]   different assortments of jams.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.520]   And so the two options were 50 jams and 10 jams.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.920]   Those were on display for you to choose one.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.960]   And so 60% of the customers went to the place
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.260]   where there were 50 jams.
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.880]   They wanted more options.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.520]   We all think that more options, that's better.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.040]   Everyone that came in here with the preconceived notion
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.860]   that hey, if I have more options, that's better.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.840]   That's not what science says
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.260]   and not necessarily what God's word says.
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.520]   What happened, so 60% went for the large assortment,
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.120]   40% stopped by the small one, the one of 10 jams.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.120]   But 30% of the people who had sampled
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.640]   from the small assortment decided to buy jam.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.920]   While only 3% of those that confronted
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.260]   by the 50 jams decided to buy.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.160]   Do you see what happened?
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.520]   Okay, you're like, no, bro, I'm so confused.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.960]   Two jams, 10 and 50.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.780]   More people wanted to go and select from the 50,
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.880]   but the people that went to select from the 50,
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.840]   only 3% purchased.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.680]   The fewer that went to select from the 10, 30% purchased.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.040]   Because fewer options is easier to drive to a decision
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.000]   and this is what I want you to take away from that.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.400]   Research also shows that an excess of choices
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.740]   often leads us to be less, not more satisfied
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.280]   once we actually decide.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.760]   There's often that nagging feeling
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.220]   we could have done better, amen.
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.760]   We're over committed, the reason we don't commit
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.520]   is 'cause we're over committed to the wrong things.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:08.800]   Our schedule is full of commitments that are irrelevant.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.040]   Like I talk to people all the time,
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.320]   they're like, man, I'm too busy.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.920]   I'm too busy and like in the same sentence,
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.480]   they're like, man, I never miss SportsCenter though.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.360]   Dude, I'm way too busy.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.040]   But I'm having this bachelor party tonight,
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.040]   everybody's coming over, we watch The Bachelor, it's amazing.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.280]   No, bro, you don't understand,
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.860]   I can't serve at the porch, I'm way too busy.
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.700]   But dude, Downton Abbey, have you seen that?
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.080]   It's like we don't miss an episode.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.080]   I'm like, okay, you're not too busy,
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.240]   you just prioritize things different.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.080]   You have commitments in your life,
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.160]   they're just different commitments.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.760]   You've over committed to some things
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.840]   that maybe you shouldn't be committed to
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.520]   or you might wanna reconsider.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.640]   And so why should we move toward commitment?
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.040]   'Cause one, the reason you should move toward commitment
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.920]   because without it, you won't complete anything.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.000]   You can't get married without commitment.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.660]   You can't follow Christ without commitment.
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.180]   Can't even read your Bible without commitment.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.780]   Without commitment, you won't follow through.
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.620]   And here's a greater reason,
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.700]   if that doesn't resonate with you,
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.220]   the most beautiful things in life come by way of commitment.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.340]   The most beautiful things in the world
[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.100]   come to you through commitment.
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.480]   Let me explain what I mean.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.100]   I have this friend that we used to hang out with
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.020]   and we would hang out in his apartment
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.260]   and he could play the guitar and he was amazing.
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.040]   And he could entertain us for hours.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.680]   He would just grab a guitar, he'd play everything
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.720]   from like Boyz II Men to Metallica
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.360]   and everything in between, like gospel music,
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.560]   country music, Garth Brooks, George Strait.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.080]   Like he would just jam on this guitar
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.600]   and he would sing and we would just listen
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.520]   and it was incredible.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.360]   And so I was like, after hanging out with him
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.960]   for a little while, I was like, dude, I gotta learn it.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.720]   I want to learn how to play the guitar.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.560]   I really want to.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.840]   So I signed up for guitar lessons.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.920]   I went once, I left frustrated.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.780]   I went twice, I never went back again.
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.780]   But here's the deal, the desire was there.
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.040]   I want to know how to play the guitar.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.480]   I'm not willing to commit to what it takes
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.320]   to play the guitar.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.440]   I love watching B strum the guitar.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.600]   I love worshiping with these guys.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.720]   Are we glad they're back?
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.600]   It's just, you know, I love, love hanging out.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.960]   And I watch him and I'm like, dude,
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.240]   I want to play the guitar like that.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.240]   But I don't realize that's thousands and thousands
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.380]   of hours strumming that guitar to learn to play like that.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.800]   The most beautiful things in life
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.600]   come by way of commitment.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.560]   I mean, anybody can pick up a guitar and strum it.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.080]   But to make it beautiful, you have to commit.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.940]   It's long obedience in the same direction.
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.920]   And our generation has forgotten this.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.400]   We've forsaken this idea.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.440]   And so how can we make the right commitments?
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.280]   This is my second point.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.680]   How can we make the right commitments?
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.600]   Number one, and I'm just gonna give counterpoints
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.640]   to the four points I gave you under the first point.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.660]   Number one, you understand that with Christ,
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.480]   you won't miss out on anything good.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.120]   Now, this is so important.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.080]   If you're here and you're a follower of Jesus,
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.960]   you gotta understand that in the gospel,
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.020]   you are made complete, not all at once.
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.040]   I mean, you are declared righteous all at once.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.500]   But you will never get to heaven.
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.600]   I say this often here.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.360]   You're never gonna get to heaven and regret.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.280]   In fact, if there's any regret in heaven,
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.220]   and I don't believe there is, but if there is,
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.520]   it's only I regret that I didn't follow God more.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.840]   I regret I didn't share the gospel more.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.840]   I regret I didn't work harder to bring the kingdom there.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.560]   But you're never gonna be like, man, I can't believe
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.920]   they all went and got sushi and didn't call me.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.920]   Like, God, before I come in, we gotta talk about that, man.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.040]   It's just been bothering me.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.960]   Everybody's a blue fish, but me, what's up with that?
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.240]   It won't ever happen.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.640]   And so when you miss out on that opportunity,
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.440]   you can remind yourself that in the gospel,
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.700]   I will experience the full completeness of life.
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.960]   John 10:10 says, "For I have come
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.960]   "so that they might have life," this is Jesus,
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.080]   "and have it to the fullest."
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.760]   And then in the Psalms, he says this, check this out.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:06.760]   Psalm 84, verse 11, "No good thing does he withhold
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.900]   "from those whose walk is blameless."
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.680]   You're not missing out on anything.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.360]   And thinking that you are, frankly, is idolatry.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.080]   You have some idol of man, some need for approval,
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.800]   some fear of man, something in you is not complete
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.620]   when you sit there and you regret
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.400]   and mourn the reality that you were left out.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.160]   You have an identity issue, an idolatry issue.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:35.560]   And the solution is going to be leaning into Christ,
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.440]   having others pray for you in that.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:46.360]   Secondly, you remove bad options.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.840]   We said that the reason we don't commit
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.400]   is 'cause we have too many options.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.980]   And so you remove the bad options.
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.540]   Like, here's the deal, like, and this is good news,
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.100]   don't hear this as bad news.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.520]   Some of you desire marriage.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.720]   The pool from which you can marry, it's a really small pool.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.080]   Like, if you're on Tinder,
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:11.080]   like, you can eliminate 99% of Tinder.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.240]   It's a really small, like, I'm assuming you're here,
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.600]   you're a follower of Jesus, you're like, I follow Jesus.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.580]   I'm a Christian, I'm fully committed to Christ, right?
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.160]   It's a really small pool.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.840]   And that's not bad news, that's good news.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.240]   Like, they're probably in the room right now
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.040]   or they're probably on this campus
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.140]   or some other church campus a whole lot,
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:35.380]   serving there, giving there, being taught there,
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.520]   being instructed there.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.440]   I'm assuming, you know, again,
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.920]   if you're a believer in Christ,
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.360]   the one that you're gonna spend the rest of your life with
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.520]   most likely is spending a ton of time
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.520]   on a church campus somewhere in Dallas going all in.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.840]   And it's a relatively small pool.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.120]   I mean, it's a minority,
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.780]   as you consider everyone on the planet.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:58.640]   It's a relatively small section of the planet.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.280]   And so you remove the bad options,
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.860]   this actually helps you and moves you towards a commitment.
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.080]   Jesus said, you see all throughout the Old Testament,
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.200]   God said, hey, don't marry these,
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.200]   don't marry the Canaanites, don't marry these people.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.040]   You know, this is the small section that you can marry from.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.780]   In fact, I want you to travel back to that land
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:14.620]   to find a wife.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.000]   We see that in the Old Testament,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.720]   the New Testament, 2 Corinthians 6, 14,
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.440]   do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.760]   And God says, hey, no, no, if you're my people,
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.080]   then you find my people and you produce my people
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.440]   and pour into my people and disciple my people.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.440]   The first great commission, like we talked about last week.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.120]   And so as you remove bad options,
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.560]   I would just tell you as you consider a job,
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.360]   you weren't made to do everything.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.240]   Like maybe your parents said, you can do anything.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.080]   No, you can't.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.000]   There's some things you'd be really, really bad at.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.240]   [congregation laughing]
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.080]   Okay?
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.640]   You weren't meant to do everything.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.760]   God prepared works for you
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.960]   before the beginning of creation for you to walk in.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.780]   And as you rely on him, as you lean in him,
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.780]   as you walk with him, you walk in them.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:00.000]   Okay, you were made to do some specific things
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.760]   that he has for you, not anything.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.180]   Some specific things.
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.160]   And I would say anything that doesn't honor God
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.820]   is not an option.
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.160]   So as you're considering your options,
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.480]   you can ask, well, does this honor God?
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.120]   And if the answer's no, then you can remove that
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:13.960]   as an option.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.360]   That's no longer an option for me.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.760]   So we talked about last week in considering your purpose.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.920]   And then lastly, I would just say,
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.800]   if you're over-committed to some of the wrong things,
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.460]   commit to the right things.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:23.440]   What are the right things?
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.920]   The right things are church.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.520]   And I don't just mean attending a church.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.800]   I mean, being a member at a church.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.480]   You know, you're sitting right there right now.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.440]   You're sitting in a chair.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.480]   You're like, hey, I'm a Christian.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.440]   I'm a follower of Jesus.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.840]   Are you a member of a church?
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.680]   Well, JP, what does it mean?
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.500]   What do you mean?
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.340]   I mean, I go to a church.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.180]   What does it mean to be a member?
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.580]   It means to be elders there that are aware that you're there
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.140]   and you're under their authority
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.780]   so that you can learn from them,
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.100]   submit to their teaching so that you'd be a blessing,
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:45.940]   not a burden.
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.500]   That's what Hebrews 13, 17 says.
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.340]   That you're there.
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.160]   You're like, hey, I'm here,
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.440]   and I'm a contributor, not a consumer.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.280]   I'm here.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.700]   I'm a part of this body, and I'm known.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.980]   If you're not here, if you're not a member of a church,
[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.300]   you're not, what is it?
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.740]   Well, I'll just, I'll save that in a second.
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:04.960]   Here's what I would say.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.640]   You are not, you are missing out on the fullness of life
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.140]   that God has intended for you.
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:13.520]   As he writes to the church in Thessalonica,
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.800]   the church in Philippi,
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.160]   and I've seen people take this small step.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:19.520]   I see some of you out there right now.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.160]   You've taken this small step, and you just said,
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.000]   hey, you know what?
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.820]   I'm here.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:23.660]   I'm thinking, you know, I've never really been in church.
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:24.880]   I was at my parents' church,
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.460]   but I've never really been a member of my own,
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.480]   but now I'm all adult now,
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.480]   so I'm gonna become a member,
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.000]   and you take that small step,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.080]   and then all of a sudden,
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.640]   God begins to use you in incredible ways
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:36.840]   and set you free in beautiful and magnificent ways
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.520]   through that commitment, and that's important.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.840]   Community, small group.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.560]   If you're a member of this church,
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.660]   this weekend we have this deal called Group Link.
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.640]   If you're here, you know that you don't have
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.680]   a small group of brothers and sisters
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.760]   that you meet with on a regular basis
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.440]   to go through life.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.420]   We wanna help with that.
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:00.400]   We wanna change that.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.780]   I believe that it's one of the smallest steps
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.400]   you can take to receive the biggest return on investment
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.760]   outside of trusting in Christ.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.940]   God has blessed me more through the context of community
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:12.440]   than any other thing in my life.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.240]   He saved my marriage through community,
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.080]   and so if you're here and you're like,
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.400]   you know what, I'm not in a small group,
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.440]   I'm not in a community group
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.780]   that I meet with on a weekly basis
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.400]   for the purpose of knowing God and making him known,
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.680]   let's change that.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.080]   Tonight, if you wanna hear more about that,
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.760]   guys can go through this hallway.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.600]   There's gonna be a room there.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.480]   Girls can go through this hallway.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.400]   There's gonna be a room there,
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.800]   and they'd love to talk with you more about that.
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.940]   (chuckles)
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.980]   Commit to serving somewhere,
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.660]   using your gifts and talents,
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.660]   and then listen, here's what I wanna tell you.
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:43.580]   Commit to Christ.
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:49.500]   Like some of you, you're like, I'm a Christian.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.220]   I'm not talking about check the box Christian.
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:54.020]   I'm talking about going all in with Jesus.
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:55.020]   And do you know that if you,
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.900]   like I could say, hey man, commit to purity.
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.740]   If you're committed to Christ, you're committed to purity.
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.720]   They'd be like, hey man, you need to commit to sobriety.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.040]   If you're committed to Jesus, you're committed to sobriety.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.280]   You know, if you're committed to Jesus,
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.280]   you're committed to church.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.040]   If you're committed to Jesus, you're committed to community.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.600]   If you're committed to Christ, you're committed to service.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.720]   The Spirit of God living inside of you
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.620]   is producing these things through you.
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.200]   And so if you're just gonna do one,
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.780]   commit to Jesus, go all in with Jesus.
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.400]   Not like, hey, it's a good idea.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.760]   No, God, I'm here and I'm yours,
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.640]   and I got a few years left, maybe.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.260]   Should God willing use the rest of my life?
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.940]   I've wasted so much of my life behind me.
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.220]   Would you take it from here?
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.600]   And I look out there and I see some of you
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:41.080]   that have done that, and it has made all the difference.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.060]   It has made all the difference.
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:48.220]   Christianity moved, Christ moved from an idea to a life.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:54.400]   So,
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:37:00.320]   as you consider these things, like why they're important,
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.000]   why does this matter?
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.640]   It's unbelievable what the Scripture says in and about this.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.600]   He just says in Jesus, when he gives a sermon on the mount,
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.040]   he says, he's talking about the most important things,
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.500]   and he says, hey, you need to keep your commitments.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.720]   He says that, and also it says in the Scriptures
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.520]   in Numbers 30, all throughout the Old Testament,
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.200]   God says, hey, this is important.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.280]   I want you to keep your commitments.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.400]   Psalm 15, one, in verse four, says this.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.080]   The Lord, he says, Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent,
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.040]   who may live on your holy mountain,
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.360]   who keeps an oath even when it hurts
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.080]   and does not change their mind.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.520]   Who's your man or woman, God?
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.920]   The one who keeps an oath, even when it hurts,
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.320]   even when it costs them something,
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.000]   even when they feel like they're missing out on something,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.440]   and they don't change their mind.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.000]   That's my man, that's my woman.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.920]   So why does this matter is my third point.
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.120]   Why does this matter?
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.440]   Because it's consistent with God's character.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.600]   God keeps his commitments.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.880]   Like your whole faith is based on the reality,
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.380]   the concept, the promise,
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.640]   that God keeps his commitments, right?
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.720]   Numbers 23, verse 19, God is not human,
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.880]   that he should lie, not a human being,
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.160]   that he should change his mind.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.760]   Does he speak and then not act?
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.760]   Does he promise and not fulfill?
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.400]   And then Titus 1, 2 says, in the hope of eternal life,
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.160]   which God, who does not lie,
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.600]   promised before the beginning of time.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.600]   And so we live with the hope that God keeps his commitments
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.000]   and Jesus is the proof of that, right?
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.440]   For who, for the joy set before him endured the cross.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.320]   What if Jesus didn't keep his commitments?
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:41.920]   He's in the garden and he says, Lord, not my will, period.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.880]   No, I don't want to.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.240]   I'm out, it's gonna hurt.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:49.640]   But that's not what he does.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.040]   He says, not my will, but Lord, he's like,
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.060]   God, I don't want to.
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:54.900]   I don't want to.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.600]   I'm seeing that thing and it looks like
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.500]   they're gonna slowly kill me on it and I don't want to,
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.460]   but I will do whatever honors you.
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:06.000]   And if you're gonna, you don't like to deal with your sin,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.480]   like nobody, I've sat with a lot of girls,
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.680]   they don't like to talk about their abortion.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.520]   I've sat with a lot of guys,
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.640]   they don't love to talk about their pornography struggles.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.660]   And vice versa.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.360]   People don't like to talk about their debt.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.600]   We don't like to talk about their sin.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.700]   Jesus didn't like enduring all of it at once.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.020]   All of your abortions went on him,
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:24.120]   all of your pornography went on him,
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.400]   all of your sex before marriage,
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.820]   you're sitting here and you feel shame.
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:28.680]   You feel shame, why?
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.080]   Because you think the cross wasn't good enough.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:34.240]   It was good enough.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.560]   As Shane said, it is finished.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.560]   It's finished, it's paid for, it's done.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.380]   And now you walk in freedom and in commitment.
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:46.000]   And you're here and you're like, well, JP, listen, man.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.400]   Okay, that's cool and all, but what about when I gotta,
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.920]   what about when I commit and I gotta take it back?
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.640]   I'm gonna give you something, this is free, write it down.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.040]   It's really practical, okay?
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.960]   This is really practical, it really helped me.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.200]   I'm gonna give it to you.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:01.040]   When you commit to something, when you say,
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.240]   hey, I'll be there Tuesday at seven,
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.760]   what you've done is you've given the gift of your time.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.800]   And then all of a sudden you find out
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.000]   your grandmother's coming into town
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.720]   and you've gotta see her Tuesday at seven.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.200]   And so you call that friend who you said,
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.680]   hey, I'll be there Tuesday at seven,
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.320]   and you say, hey, I just found out
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.280]   that my grandmother's in town.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.640]   You don't manage information.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.980]   You say, hey, this is what's going on.
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.420]   Not something came up, this is what's going on.
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.480]   May I please have that commitment back?
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.880]   I gave you the gift of my time Tuesday at seven.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.180]   I gave you a commitment, I gave it to you as a gift.
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:35.320]   May I please have that back?
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.200]   Would you give me that commitment back?
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.280]   And they can say yes, no, or maybe.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.200]   And if they say no, you say, all right, I'm sorry, Grandma.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.200]   I committed and I wanna live a life above reproach
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.560]   and I'm gonna honor my commitment.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.760]   And I don't think you'll get up to heaven and be like,
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.760]   God'll be like, hey, shame on you,
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.060]   you kept your commitments.
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:54.240]   Did you catch that?
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.000]   When you give someone a commitment,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.860]   you've given them a gift, and if you need it back,
[00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:01.400]   you simply ask for it back and you tell them clearly why.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.600]   Can I have that back?
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.600]   It's free.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:10.960]   We talk about how God calls people to a church.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.560]   David Platt said, "Biblically, Christians are not
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.840]   "church avoiders, attenders, hoppers, or shoppers.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.160]   "Biblically, Christians are church members."
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.520]   And then Todd Wagner, this is the quote
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.080]   I was gonna say earlier.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:23.120]   "A regular attender is a misnomer.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.200]   "You are an irregular believer."
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.760]   And I hear all the time, I'm like,
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.600]   hey, are you a church member?
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.320]   No, no, man, I'll be moving soon.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.300]   Cool, be a member 'til you move.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:37.640]   That's a good reason to transfer membership.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.280]   Are you a church, do you member somewhere?
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.480]   No, man, I work at night.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.440]   Oh, cool, man, well, let's consider
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.460]   what membership would look like and we can find a time
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.560]   that works for you or a time to stream or something,
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.440]   but you can still be under the authority.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.480]   Of church leadership.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.040]   And can I just shoot you real straight?
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.680]   I've never in my entire eight years of vocational ministry
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.640]   heard any good reason for someone not to belong
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.240]   to a church, ever, not once.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.320]   It doesn't exist, so if you're here and you're like,
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.600]   man, I think I've got a good reason,
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.760]   I'll be up front afterwards, I'd love to hear it.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.920]   I'd be really curious and I'll apologize next week.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.160]   I'll be like, hey, guys, I heard a good reason.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.080]   [congregation laughing]
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.380]   Serving the body, belonging to a small group,
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.200]   committed to your spouse, you're like,
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.480]   I'm not married, cool, committed to your spouse.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.700]   Looks like praying for 'em, saving yourself for them,
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.060]   being committed to purity,
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:29.720]   asking God to bring them at the right time,
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.180]   trusting his timing.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:34.340]   If you wanna be married, looking for them actively, guys.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:39.960]   And I'm just gonna say it again.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:44.160]   Committed to Christ, if you've heard nothing else.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.860]   You go all in with Jesus and you're gonna be just fine.
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.200]   It's so crazy 'cause I had this illustration in here
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.040]   about a Maasai warrior.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.360]   I was in Africa once and in the Maasai mara,
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.320]   we got to sit with the Maasai warriors.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:59.520]   These are the guys, they kill their food with spears
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.480]   and they're in the jungle and they have the long earlobes
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.960]   and the neck things and the neck rings and all that.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.000]   These are the Maasai people and I was talking with them
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.740]   and when I came back, somebody had sent this to me
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:13.920]   and I just thought this was excellent
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.560]   so I wanna read it to you.
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.900]   Vincent Donovan tells of a conversation
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.140]   with a Maasai elder about the word for faith.
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.700]   And so they're trying to find a word for faith
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.060]   that translates to their language
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:27.300]   and the elder contended that the word that they chose
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.000]   in his language was unsatisfactory
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.520]   because it meant only to agree to.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.180]   He said that it was similar to a white hunter
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:38.080]   shooting an animal with his gun from a great distance.
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.720]   Only his eyes and his fingers took part in the act.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.580]   "We should find another word," he said.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:49.680]   He said, "For a man really to commit to Christ
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.960]   "is like a lion going after its prey.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:56.700]   "His nose and his eyes and his ears pick up the prey.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.580]   "His legs give him the speed to catch it.
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:02.440]   "All the power of his body is involved
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.800]   "in the terrible death leap and single blow to the neck
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:09.620]   "with the front paw, the blow that actually kills.
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.080]   "And as the animal goes down,
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.340]   "the lion envelops it in his arms,
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:17.400]   "pulls it to himself and makes it a part of himself.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.180]   "This is the way the lion kills.
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.640]   "This is the way a man believes.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.080]   "This is what faith is.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.620]   "This is commitment to Christ."
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:30.120]   (congregation applauding)
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:34.720]   This is what God wants from you.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:38.000]   That you would go all in with him.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.760]   What if FOMO is causing you to miss out
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.720]   on the greatness that God has for you?
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:50.000]   What if you're sitting there and you're getting rich
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.200]   and you're having fun and you're pursuing pleasure
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.840]   and you're missing out on life,
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.440]   a life that you were called to,
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:01.760]   a greater life that was meant for you
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:06.560]   through full commitment and devotion to Jesus?
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.520]   You know if you're living that kind of commitment or not.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.040]   You hear that and you know, you're like,
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.000]   "Man, that's me, man.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.680]   "I'm walking with Jesus like a lion kills its prey."
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:20.800]   Or, "I'm walking with Jesus like a hunter from afar."
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:27.240]   My eyes, my fingers, small movement, small commitment.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:31.720]   And I've seen this, man.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.120]   Talking to my friend Ryan and Sylvia earlier.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:38.200]   And just how this commitment, this one decision
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.020]   changed everything in their life.
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:42.520]   My buddy Alan said, "The definition of hell on earth
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.700]   "is having one foot in the world and one foot in the church
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:47.540]   "'cause you're not committed to either
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:49.200]   "and you're missing out on both."
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:55.460]   In summary, we fear commitment for many reasons
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:58.160]   that are all satisfied in a commitment to Christ.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.980]   And this matters because our belief,
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:05.420]   our very belief system is based on commitment, faith.
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:08.380]   And here's the problem.
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:09.220]   This is what I believe.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:10.180]   This is what I ask the Lord,
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:12.120]   what I should share with you tonight.
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.620]   This is what it culminates to.
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:17.900]   I believe that we see commitment through a broken lens.
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:21.120]   The lens of sin as it entered the world through the fall.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.380]   And this broken lens of commitment
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:24.800]   has impacted our view of God
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.360]   because we believe that God the Father loves us
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.340]   maybe like a temporary father.
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:32.340]   One that was sometimes not there or late to pick us up.
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.860]   Or maybe one that turned his back on us
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.540]   or wasn't there at all.
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:38.500]   Maybe one we never met.
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.180]   We believe that God in heaven,
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.220]   the one who loves us unconditionally,
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.580]   loves us as others have told us.
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:46.140]   They loved us unconditionally but failed miserably.
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:51.340]   And so somehow our view of God's radical pursuit
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:54.120]   and commitment to us is tainted by the broken world
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.220]   as its redefined commitment as we know it.
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.460]   And we say, hey, I know God loves me
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.740]   and I've seen the cross and the empty tomb
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:05.200]   and I know the gospel, but it's still broken.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:09.780]   And he says I've sent my son to die for your sins
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.700]   and I've deposited with you the promise,
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.460]   the seal of the Holy Spirit.
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:17.780]   And we say, yeah, and there's times where we sense that
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:19.660]   and even feel that.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:23.420]   But if we're true to ourselves,
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.860]   the majority of our lives are overwhelmed
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.580]   by the brokenness of the world,
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:28.820]   the stress of the days,
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.260]   the pressures of our jobs and relationships.
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.180]   And we say, I believe God, God loves me.
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.500]   I think he loves me.
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:41.780]   And we don't understand how he loves you.
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:46.860]   I was out here for baptism, Baptism Sunday.
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:48.060]   It's just this amazing day.
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:50.540]   We baptized a couple hundred people
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:53.860]   and we had bounce houses and hamburgers.
[00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:54.680]   It's a party.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.420]   There's a couple, a few thousand people out there
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:59.780]   and I was making my way through the crowd
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:04.460]   and I saw this boy about four years old
[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:09.060]   screaming, I mean crying, sobbing, weeping,
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:12.660]   frantically crying, I mean deep breaths
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:14.140]   and just to let out screams.
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.740]   And I went up to him and I kind of moved toward him
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:18.420]   and he jumped back, was afraid of me
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.020]   and I got down low and I said, are you lost?
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:24.260]   And he kind of threw tears and screaming,
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.060]   kind of nodded his head slightly.
[00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:27.540]   I said, have you been separated from your parents?
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:28.780]   He kind of nodded his head.
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.660]   And so I went to pick him up and he wasn't really willing,
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.060]   but I brought him close to me
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:34.460]   and he kind of held back
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:36.920]   and I grabbed him by the back of his head.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:40.220]   And I said, I will not leave you
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:42.860]   until I find your parents.
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:45.140]   I said, I want you to hear me, I will.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.740]   And he's screaming and I said,
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:50.980]   will not let you go until you are back
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.500]   with your mom or your dad.
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:55.220]   I will not let you go until you are back
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:56.220]   with your mom or dad.
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.900]   I will not let you go.
[00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.900]   I will not leave you until you are back
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.700]   with your mom and your dad.
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:05.180]   And he slowly calmed down and I climbed up
[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:07.600]   on the top of a bench and looked around
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.760]   and this woman from afar across the parking lot
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:13.480]   saw me holding her son and ran for us
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:15.500]   and I handed her to him and they reunited
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:16.760]   and she embraced him.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.780]   It was this beautiful scene
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:21.060]   and that's what the Holy Spirit does right now.
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:25.440]   He's to you, he said, I will not let you go.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.560]   This is my promise.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.500]   I will not let you go until you are back
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.340]   with your father in the fullness of his presence,
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:32.740]   face to face with your father.
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:33.780]   I will not let you go.
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:35.520]   You can run, I will chase you.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.140]   I'm faster.
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.340]   You wanna keep running in that sin,
[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:41.740]   you wanna keep doing those things,
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:43.700]   you wanna keep committing to the wrong things,
[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:46.120]   but I'm committed to you through it all
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.500]   and I will not let you go until you are back
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:49.440]   with your father.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.860]   Until you are in the fullness of his presence,
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:54.900]   till you see him, till you're all embraced,
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.800]   I will not let you go.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:01.140]   This is the Holy Spirit in our life.
[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.020]   This is what Jesus gave to us
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:05.180]   through his death and resurrection on the cross.
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:10.180]   This is God's radical, unwavering, unyielding,
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:15.620]   unstopping, powerful movement and commitment towards you.
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:20.520]   (congregation applauding)
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:23.700]   Can't wait to be up there with you all.
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.340]   Experience that with you all.
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:30.960]   Don't waste your life here committing to stupid things.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.360]   Let me pray that we commit to him.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:37.120]   And Father, you're so committed to us
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.960]   as you've demonstrated for us in and through the gospel,
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:43.360]   in and through Jesus, all that you've given to us.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:45.200]   You've given up your very own son
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.200]   so that we can be with you forever
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.680]   and you tell us that we've been sealed by your spirit,
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.520]   that you've deposited yourself inside of us
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.960]   as a promise that we will one day be with you again.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.000]   Would you renew our minds around that promise, Lord?
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.400]   Father, would you help us to know you?
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.440]   Would you help us to believe you?
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:10.120]   Would you help us to realize that commitment to us?
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:15.860]   Fathers, there's friends here
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.480]   that feel like they're faster than you,
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:19.360]   that they've ran past your reach.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:24.840]   Would you remind them or show them for the first time
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:25.880]   that that's not true?
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:30.280]   Lord, thank you for the life that you've given us in Jesus.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:33.280]   Thank you for all that you're doing here in and through us.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:36.720]   in here, in and through us.
