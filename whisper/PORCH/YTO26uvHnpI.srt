1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:27,240
 - All right, well, welcome friends of the room,

3
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,200
 friends of Fort Worth.

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,540
 He's excited, Houston, El Paso, Phoenix,

5
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,320
 Fayetteville, Philadelphia, North Carolina,

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,360
 wherever you're joining us from, we're so excited.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,540
 We are wrapping up this mood series tonight.

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,380
 Let me start by sharing a little bit of something

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,780
 related to the Marvin household recently.

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,840
 My kids are terrible sleepers,

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,120
 and I like to think they get this from their mother,

12
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,680
 but I think that would be a lie.

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,760
 And she reminds me often that that probably comes

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,080
 from their father, who's not a great napper,

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,560
 not a great sleeper, and so we have done everything

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,600
 we can to try to get them to sleep.

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,000
 The latest thing we've been attempting to do

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,160
 is cut out as much sugar as we can anytime around bedtime,

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,840
 'cause we wanna make sure there's very little sugar

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,720
 so that they'll go right to sleep, and it has not worked.

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,320
 And so that has led me to discover,

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,560
 man, what could that possibly be?

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,600
 Like, what is not causing sleep?

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,840
 And in looking even the sugar thing,

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,600
 I recently came across a discovery

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,320
 that sugar has nothing to do with your energy levels.

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,680
 Do you know this?

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,480
 Like, it's not responsible, this is a little bit

29
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,920
 mind-blowing, but I'm going somewhere, people,

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,920
 so just stay with me.

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,960
 It's not responsible for sleep in children, sleep in you.

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,580
 If it's chocolate, there could be caffeine,

33
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,720
 which could be a factor, but it doesn't have anything

34
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,920
 to do with that, and that kind of led me

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,280
 down an article spiral.

36
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,760
 Ever been on the internet, and you're like,

37
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,400
 all of a sudden, you're going to check your email,

38
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,760
 and then you're on the vortex of just information,

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,680
 and you're checking out like one myth after the next

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,640
 after the next from the article that you looked up

41
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,000
 related to sugar?

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And this kind of will give us some traction

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,840
 for where we're going tonight,

44
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,400
 'cause there were like several different things

45
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,520
 and myths that I came across in exploring that one

46
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,840
 that I really think most of us or many of us

47
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,760
 have heard for a long time in my life,

48
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,320
 and they just are not true, apparently.

49
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,640
 So not just is sugar not responsible for increasing

50
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,840
 energy levels in kids or people,

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,280
 there's other myths that maybe you walked into this room.

52
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,360
 This is one that maybe you've heard of before,

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,160
 or at least it's kind of hard for me to believe,

54
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,840
 and it is that shaving definitely will not make

55
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,900
 the hair come back thicker.

56
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,300
 If you shave an area, and I think we all at some point,

57
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,420
 at least I grew up in high school,

58
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,380
 and there's this like moment,

59
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,060
 and depending on if you're a guy or a girl,

60
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,660
 how you interact with this is very different,

61
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,300
 'cause if you're a guy, you're hoping that your facial hair

62
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,220
 is gonna come in in high school,

63
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,580
 so you're like shaving every day,

64
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,480
 just hoping that three hairs are gonna pop up.

65
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,340
 And if you're a girl, you're like, hey,

66
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,960
 the one thing you cannot do is wax right here.

67
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,040
 You shave right here, it's gonna blow up on you,

68
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,660
 so you need to be very careful about what you do.

69
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,700
 But apparently, it is totally a myth.

70
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,400
 Shaving will not make it come back thicker.

71
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,740
 Here's another one, turkey.

72
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,260
 Turkey does not make you tired.

73
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,540
 Anyone ever heard this before?

74
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,180
 Yes, it's a myth.

75
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,900
 Turkey does not make, before anybody's like,

76
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,060
 no, wait a second, hey, Thanksgiving, I've experienced it.

77
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,260
 It is not turkey that makes you tired,

78
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,380
 it's that you're bloated, and you had too much dessert,

79
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,160
 or alcohol, or something that made you feel like,

80
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,180
 man, I just need a nap, but it is not.

81
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,540
 And in case a lot of you guys are checking,

82
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,740
 and you're like, wait, there's some hormone

83
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,580
 that's inside of it, that hormone is in every meat.

84
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,480
 So any meat should make, in fact, it's in cheese.

85
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,760
 If you had cheese, it should make you just as tired.

86
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,360
 It's not true, it's a myth.

87
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,240
 Another myth that maybe you came into this room believing,

88
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,800
 I found this one out today, someone told me,

89
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,240
 and then verifying it, a dog's mouth

90
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,960
 is not cleaner than a human mouth.

91
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,840
 Yeah, what?

92
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,560
 Depending on who your dog is, I guess,

93
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,480
 this would be a fact, and depending on who you are,

94
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,320
 and how often you brush, but on average,

95
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,640
 a dog's mouth is not cleaner than a human mouth.

96
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,460
 This is only said by people who love their dog

97
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,020
 licking their face, and you should stop it.

98
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,140
 It's weirding everybody out, and his mouth is not cleaner,

99
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,620
 and you should let anybody lick your face, let alone a dog.

100
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,740
 But it is a myth that a dog's mouth is cleaner.

101
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,200
 Here's another one, a very famous one.

102
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,640
 Urine will take away a jellyfish sting.

103
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,860
 Now, if you grew up in the era that I did,

104
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,760
 you saw Monica and Chandler in the episode of Friends,

105
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,000
 where Chandler steps in, I can't believe

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,040
 this is how we're opening.

107
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,640
 Chandler steps in after Monica gets stung by a jellyfish,

108
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,720
 and he's like, "I gotta help out."

109
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,260
 This is not true, so if anyone, if you're ever at the beach,

110
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,400
 and you get stung by a jellyfish,

111
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,480
 and somebody tries to come up and help you,

112
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,480
 tell them to back it up, because it will not help you.

113
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,200
 In fact, it can often make things worse, apparently.

114
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,440
 Saltwater is your best option at that point,

115
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,300
 'cause it'll clean it out, but urine is definitely,

116
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,600
 is never really the solution to any problem that you have.

117
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,360
 And it is a myth, and whoever came up with this,

118
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,540
 I'm not even sure where it came from,

119
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,720
 other than maybe that episode in general.

120
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,640
 But the reason I start there is 'cause in talking

121
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,440
 about myths and how if you believe a myth,

122
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,920
 it can impact your behavior, and just the truth,

123
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,880
 and how oftentimes culture, or just different people,

124
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,040
 we grow up and we kind of embrace these different myths,

125
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,540
 and they impact our lives.

126
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,320
 Some on really silly and fun ways.

127
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,160
 There's other things in life where we embrace a myth,

128
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,400
 and it has tremendous impact.

129
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,040
 And tonight, we're gonna talk about the subject,

130
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,720
 or the mood of loneliness.

131
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,460
 And we're gonna explore some of the myths that people,

132
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,840
 oftentimes well-intentioned people, promote,

133
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,500
 and oftentimes many of us believe

134
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,980
 as it relates to loneliness,

135
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,100
 and what a solution to loneliness is.

136
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,140
 So we're gonna look at three teachings from God's word

137
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,500
 on the subject of loneliness.

138
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,860
 Three myths and then three truths

139
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,300
 that come directly from Scripture

140
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,300
 as it relates to loneliness.

141
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,320
 This has been called the loneliest generation.

142
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,980
 A recent study found that 68% of young adults

143
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,540
 would say that no one really knows them.

144
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,240
 It's been called the most connected generation in history,

145
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,140
 and it's also one of the loneliest of all time.

146
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,200
 Consistently, a majority of young adults

147
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,480
 describe feeling extremely lonely,

148
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,520
 or very lonely, on a consistent basis.

149
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:07,060
 Despite the fact that we are more connected

150
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,020
 than we've ever been before,

151
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,900
 we're often less known than we've ever been before.

152
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,540
 In fact, young adulthood in general

153
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,680
 can kind of be a lonely time.

154
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,140
 Because if you think about it,

155
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,760
 it's just I was thinking about it this past week,

156
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,380
 your whole life you're kind of like running

157
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,220
 with your crew and your friends from very early on

158
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,260
 until you reach young adulthood.

159
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,760
 So you start in elementary school,

160
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,220
 you're hanging out, you're on the playground,

161
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,580
 you're running around playing tetherball,

162
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,460
 you're all together, then you move on to junior high.

163
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,780
 You're still together, you just get a locker this time,

164
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,600
 and you get a little bigger,

165
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,480
 and you start going through puberty,

166
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,620
 but we're all in this together.

167
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,940
 Then you move on to high school,

168
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,580
 and you still got your crew that you're running with,

169
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,780
 and your friends are all together,

170
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,860
 and you're just with your group of people this whole time.

171
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,700
 Then you go to college,

172
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,020
 and there's a little bit of splitting off,

173
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,220
 but it's like, hey, I'll see you back there,

174
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,960
 we'll hang out when we come back for the summers,

175
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,800
 but we're going off,

176
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,740
 and I'm still around people my age and my age group.

177
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,120
 And then all of a sudden it's like the track is going along,

178
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,720
 and everything's fine, and it's like the track runs out,

179
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,080
 and there's just a total decline,

180
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,280
 and you're just free falling out into the real world

181
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,360
 after you graduate college,

182
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,000
 and you're like, oh my gosh, all of my people,

183
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,880
 I'm no longer just around all 21 year olds all the time.

184
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,400
 I no longer live with seven roommates all the time.

185
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,720
 I'm in a new city, I got a new job,

186
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,920
 I don't work with a bunch of people like me

187
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,800
 and my age all the time, and I'm kind of free falling,

188
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,600
 and I just feel alone.

189
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,740
 And so I don't know what your experience

190
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,880
 with loneliness has looked like,

191
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,020
 and what it looks like today,

192
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,260
 but it's a feeling that all of us

193
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,920
 at some point in our lives have,

194
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,880
 and if you haven't experienced it,

195
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,300
 you're either going to experience it in the future,

196
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,100
 and knowing how to face it and combat it,

197
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,660
 because it's loneliness that's responsible

198
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,900
 for so many issues that spring forward

199
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,340
 out of that loneliness.

200
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,420
 People get into relationships they shouldn't be in,

201
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,540
 people start interacting with alcohol

202
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,480
 in a way that is destructive towards them,

203
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,600
 and further relationships drives them back

204
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,920
 into shame and loneliness,

205
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,640
 and people just make all types of decisions

206
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,760
 to try to deal with the pain,

207
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,440
 because it is such a real pain

208
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,360
 that can come with loneliness.

209
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,760
 So we're gonna look at God's word

210
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,120
 about how to battle real solutions for loneliness,

211
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,320
 and how to reject and identify real lives

212
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,200
 as it relates to loneliness.

213
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,920
 So if you take notes, you can take notes,

214
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,200
 we're gonna go through three of these things,

215
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,840
 and look at the scriptures that correspond.

216
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,160
 The first myth as it relates to loneliness

217
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,660
 is related to friends, and it's specifically this.

218
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,680
 Friends can fix my loneliness.

219
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,200
 Friends can fix my loneliness.

220
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,960
 The truth is that it is the right friends

221
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,280
 that help us to fight loneliness.

222
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,480
 It is not just friends in general

223
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,620
 that can fix my loneliness,

224
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,420
 but the solution is that I don't need more friends,

225
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,480
 or my old friends, or my college friends, or any friends.

226
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,080
 The truth is that the Bible says

227
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,240
 that you are to have the right friends,

228
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,320
 to have real friends,

229
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,460
 and friends that align with God's design

230
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,400
 to the types of friend relationships

231
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,240
 that you're supposed to have.

232
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,060
 You may not know this,

233
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,080
 God cares about you having friends in your life,

234
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,760
 and having the right types of friends in your life.

235
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,720
 And he gets very clear in scripture

236
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,280
 about the types of relationships

237
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,600
 that are to mark your life and my life.

238
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,920
 Proverbs 18, 24 says this.

239
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,280
 "A man of many companions may come to ruin."

240
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,400
 So a man of many companions,

241
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,440
 this could be a man of many Facebook friends,

242
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,760
 a man of many Instagram followers,

243
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,240
 a man who knows a lot of people,

244
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,460
 "may come to ruin."

245
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,880
 But there's a friend that sticks closer than a brother.

246
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,000
 The Bible says that there's a type of relationship

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,900
 that you can have with lots of people,

248
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,140
 but there are certain relationships

249
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,120
 that should mark your life,

250
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,240
 that no matter what you face,

251
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,080
 they're sticking by you,

252
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,920
 and you're sticking by them.

253
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,220
 That there's this real friend that God wants you to have.

254
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,140
 Specifically, here's the type of real friends,

255
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,940
 or the right friendships that should mark your life,

256
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,420
 or should be a part of your life.

257
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,340
 People who know you, and who know God.

258
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,700
 People who know you, and who know God.

259
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,620
 And we'll talk about and unpack

260
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,460
 why that's so important here in a second.

261
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,560
 But the solution to fixing any loneliness

262
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,900
 is not more relationships,

263
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,860
 not more out social activities,

264
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,540
 it is having the right friendships.

265
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,240
 And if you do not get this right,

266
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,980
 you will not fight and battle loneliness

267
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,620
 in the way that God wants you to experience.

268
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,720
 A freedom from loneliness,

269
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,140
 and the ability to fight against loneliness.

270
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,340
 It's not just any friendships,

271
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,420
 it is the right ones.

272
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,320
 Just like, it's not dissimilar to,

273
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,020
 if you go to fill an empty room in your apartment,

274
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,100
 or an empty room in your house,

275
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,860
 you're looking for somebody to split the rent with,

276
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,700
 or split the lease with,

277
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,580
 there's a couple ways you could go about that.

278
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,500
 The first would be through a connection,

279
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,560
 through a relationship,

280
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,980
 through an old friend, an acquaintance,

281
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,800
 somebody you know,

282
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,940
 somebody from this church,

283
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,860
 somebody from your church,

284
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,780
 wherever you're connected to,

285
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,620
 somebody who you're like,

286
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,260
 "Oh, I think we kind of would run together well."

287
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,540
 Then you could go what is the more risky approach,

288
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,820
 which is called Craigslist.

289
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,420
 And you could go search for,

290
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,620
 looking for a roommate.

291
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,100
 And what you're likely to experience

292
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,760
 is a roommate that no longer,

293
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,820
 is not someone that you get excited about going home,

294
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,780
 and being around all the time,

295
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,380
 but someone who doesn't know how to wash out the pasta

296
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,500
 out of the pot when they finish cooking,

297
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,340
 somebody who borrows everything that you have,

298
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,180
 and is like,

299
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,000
 "I thought we were kind of sharing

300
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,840
 "this whole thing together."

301
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,660
 Somebody who doesn't tell you

302
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,420
 that they're bringing over friends

303
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,220
 that are gonna stay in the middle of the week,

304
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,060
 over the night,

305
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,700
 somebody who leaves the TV on till one o'clock.

306
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,660
 The same way that we'd all go like,

307
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,620
 "Hey, yeah, the goal is not to just,

308
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,680
 "you know, fill the empty room,

309
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,960
 "it's to fill the room with the right person."

310
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,800
 And in the same way,

311
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,620
 the goal is not just for you

312
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,580
 to try to fill the empty parts of your heart,

313
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,140
 whereas the relationships with people in general,

314
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,480
 it's to fill them with the right people,

315
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,740
 specifically people who know God,

316
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,580
 and who know you.

317
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,600
 And I'm gonna talk about both of those.

318
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,420
 Without both of those being present,

319
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,600
 you are not going to experience the type of friendships

320
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
 that God wants you to have.

321
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,220
 And he designed you for relationships.

322
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,400
 The very first thing that God says is not good

323
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,940
 was man to be alone.

324
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,820
 Before the garden,

325
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,460
 or before sin was entered into the world,

326
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,880
 in the book of Genesis,

327
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,720
 God said,

328
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,220
 "It is not good for man to be alone."

329
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,540
 You were designed for relationships,

330
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,700
 but not just any relationships

331
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,780
 will help you battle loneliness.

332
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,760
 The right ones will.

333
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,340
 So what do I mean by knowing you,

334
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,180
 or knowing God?

335
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,720
 Specifically as it relates to knowing you,

336
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,560
 they know you,

337
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,220
 they know flaws and all.

338
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,940
 You open up and have a life in front of them

339
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,780
 where they know,

340
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,660
 not just kind of what everyone sees on the outside,

341
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,380
 they know all of the different,

342
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,680
 just parts of you where God still needs to take ground.

343
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,520
 If you're a Christian,

344
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,000
 you should have people who know you.

345
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,220
 They know where you struggle,

346
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,500
 they know the areas where you're tempted.

347
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,180
 The Bible says in Hebrews chapter three,

348
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,660
 verse 13,

349
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,600
 verse 12 and 13,

350
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,420
 "Take care, brothers,

351
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,220
 "lest there be in any of you an evil

352
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,260
 "and an unbelieving heart,

353
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,420
 "leading you to fall away from the living God."

354
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,700
 So hey, everybody listen up,

355
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,260
 I want you to make sure that you watch out

356
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,380
 that in the midst of you guys,

357
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,220
 he's talking to this,

358
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,740
 that writer of Hebrews is writing this church,

359
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,420
 there's not an unbelieving heart,

360
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,020
 or part of you that doesn't trust God,

361
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,300
 that could lead you to turn away from your faith.

362
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,500
 But here's the way to do that.

363
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,780
 "But exhort or call out one another."

364
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:39,580
 Exhort one another every day as long as it is called today,

365
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,200
 so that none of you would be hardened

366
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,260
 by the deceitfulness of sin.

367
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,900
 That God says, hey, the antidote,

368
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,300
 the remedy for you having your heart hardened by sin

369
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,540
 is to have people in your life

370
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,740
 that can look in and exhort or call you

371
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,780
 to the standard of God's word.

372
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,420
 They can call you out in the areas of your life

373
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,460
 that you need to be called out.

374
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,080
 And they can call me out in the areas of my life

375
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,300
 that I need to be called out.

376
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,300
 How is that possible?

377
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,900
 The only way it's possible is for them to know

378
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,140
 the areas of your life that you need to be called out in.

379
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,060
 For them to know what's going on

380
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,940
 in your dating relationship.

381
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,980
 For you to open up your life and share about the anxiety

382
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,300
 that you feel at work.

383
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,940
 For them to know the challenges that you're having

384
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,260
 with your family or your parents.

385
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,940
 For them to know about the pornography addiction,

386
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,820
 the eating disorder, the cutting that's taking place.

387
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,260
 For you to open up your life and say,

388
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,980
 hey, this is not who I wanna be.

389
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,860
 God's word is clear,

390
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,560
 and I don't even wanna talk about this,

391
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,500
 but I need somebody to know it and hold me accountable

392
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,300
 and pray for me and come alongside.

393
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,380
 You will not have the right relationships

394
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,860
 unless you are willing to open up your life

395
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,980
 to other people, to be known.

396
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,740
 In Proverbs chapter 27, verse six, it says this.

397
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,260
 Faithful are the wounds of a friend,

398
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,220
 but profuse are the kisses of an enemy.

399
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,320
 That a true friend, a real friend, the Bible says,

400
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,100
 is someone who is willing to wound you with the truth

401
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,640
 because they love you enough to tell you it.

402
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,380
 So when he's not willing to be like, hey, dude, look,

403
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,340
 I know you're dating Roger, and Roger's a little crazy,

404
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,540
 I think he's got an anger problem,

405
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,380
 but I really would love to be a part of your bridal party.

406
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,340
 Can we make that happen?

407
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,460
 They're not willing to just go along with it.

408
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,980
 If they see something not consistent

409
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,540
 with what God's word says, they're willing to say,

410
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,540
 hey, can we talk about your relationship?

411
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,660
 I just feel like I'm seeing this.

412
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,700
 Maybe I'm wrong, but I wanna love you enough to wound you.

413
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,780
 Do you have friends in your life

414
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,140
 who love you enough to wound you,

415
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,360
 who love you enough to share the truth?

416
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,220
 When is the last time that someone was honest enough

417
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,060
 with you to say, hey, I see this in your life.

418
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,920
 Has anyone ever told you this before?

419
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,180
 If you wanna have real relationships and real friends,

420
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,700
 it's gonna involve people who are willing

421
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,940
 to have them speak the truth,

422
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,060
 'cause I care enough about you to speak the truth to you.

423
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,900
 And if I didn't love you,

424
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,400
 I would just tell you whatever you wanted to hear,

425
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,100
 'cause I need you to affirm something in me.

426
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,860
 But real friends are willing to speak the truth,

427
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,460
 and they're people that you have to be willing

428
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,260
 to open up your life to, so they have to know you,

429
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,260
 and the second thing, they have to know God.

430
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,020
 That if you're gonna have the type

431
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,220
 of real intimate relationships,

432
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,140
 can you be boys or can you be girls

433
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,100
 with somebody who's not a follower of Jesus

434
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,660
 or not a Christian or is like, yeah, I'm cool with that,

435
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,140
 but it's not really a big part of my life.

436
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,060
 Can you be friends with them?

437
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,620
 Sure.

438
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,700
 Can you spend a lot of time with them

439
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,100
 or can you like being around that person?

440
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,540
 Absolutely, but will you experience the type

441
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,740
 of friendship that fights against loneliness?

442
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,780
 No, because you're not experiencing a friendship

443
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,900
 that shares the most intimate part about you,

444
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,040
 which if you're a Christian, is your faith.

445
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,340
 It's the fact that you have a faith

446
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,060
 and you are in relationship with the one true God

447
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,340
 through Jesus.

448
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,660
 You're just gonna have superficial, shallow relationships,

449
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,740
 and so you may have a good time,

450
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,300
 you're able to catch up on memories,

451
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,980
 and remember that one frat party we were a part of?

452
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,380
 That was the best, man, but you're not gonna have

453
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,300
 the true, real relationship God wants for you

454
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,600
 if they're not someone who actually knows God.

455
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,380
 This is why some of us, like if you are from a family

456
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,020
 like I am where there's non-believers

457
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,380
 and non-Christians in your family,

458
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,940
 you can get around other Christians

459
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,320
 and it feels like you're closer, for me,

460
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,060
 closer with my community group,

461
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,740
 with other Christians that I've known for a while

462
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,020
 than I am from my own blood, my family,

463
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,320
 or members of my family who don't share the same faith.

464
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,680
 Why is that?

465
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,880
 Maybe you grew up in a Christian home

466
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,140
 and you're like, dude, me and my family,

467
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,500
 we're thick as thieves,

468
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,620
 and so I don't even know what you're talking about,

469
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,560
 but a lot of us, we did not,

470
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,500
 and so when we get around family and we're back home,

471
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,420
 it's like, dude, I feel closer with the Christians

472
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,720
 that I developed relationships than I do with my own family,

473
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,740
 my own blood that I was around for years, 18 years.

474
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,580
 Why is that?

475
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,200
 It's because kindred spirits is the true thing.

476
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,860
 If you share the Holy Spirit,

477
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,260
 you will have a kindred spirit with one another.

478
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,020
 You have the same values, you have the same perspective,

479
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,180
 the same faith, and the same commitment to following Christ,

480
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,940
 which is a far more uniting thing

481
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,100
 than anything any human or any family relationship will,

482
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,620
 that blood is thicker than water.

483
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,860
 Anybody heard that before?

484
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,420
 Blood is thicker than water,

485
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,840
 but the spirit is greater than them both,

486
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,100
 and it's the spirit of God that bonds his people together

487
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,820
 in the strongest relationship.

488
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,040
 If you're a Christian, you are more family to me

489
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,740
 than any family member I have that's not a believer.

490
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,140
 That's what the Bible teaches,

491
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,820
 that we are all children of God united underneath Jesus,

492
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,060
 together in the body of Christ.

493
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,700
 So you need to have real relationships

494
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,860
 with someone who knows you, that you open up your life to,

495
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,100
 and somebody who knows God.

496
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,300
 What is at stake if either one of those are gone?

497
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,940
 Well, if there's someone who knows you,

498
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,700
 but they don't know God, then you just get together,

499
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,620
 and they're like, dude,

500
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,380
 they celebrate the sins Jesus died for.

501
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,220
 They're like, oh man,

502
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,700
 hey, let's go have another one of those nights,

503
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,300
 you know, we kind of kick back, it was relaxing,

504
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,880
 we were, is it Friday, and you know, you ended up,

505
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,060
 I think you got like so wasted,

506
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,300
 you made out with that random guy,

507
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,700
 that was amazing.

508
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,220
 And yet they don't call you to be the person

509
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,120
 that you wanna be.

510
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,860
 They don't push you in the direction that you want to go.

511
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,180
 They're gonna be someone that knows you,

512
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,620
 'cause they know all the jacked up stuff,

513
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,860
 but they're like, dude, that's great,

514
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,540
 and they're gonna continue to influence you

515
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,420
 in a direction that's away from God.

516
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,940
 If they know God, but they don't really know you,

517
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,980
 they just know kind of what you let them know,

518
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,580
 and you manage your perception with them,

519
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,720
 you're not open about, here's where I'm really struggling,

520
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,820
 if you don't have people in your life that are like that,

521
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,100
 you essentially only have Facebook friends.

522
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,340
 Think about it, what's a Facebook friend?

523
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,100
 A Facebook friend is someone that I kind of manage

524
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,140
 the perception, if we're friends on Facebook,

525
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,860
 you kind of see whatever I want you to see, right?

526
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,600
 Whatever I wanna post, whatever I wanna talk about,

527
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,060
 I kind of like project whatever image

528
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,520
 that I want to to you.

529
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,940
 If you don't have people who know you,

530
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,900
 junk and all, scars and all, flaws and all,

531
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,540
 you just have Facebook friends.

532
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,660
 That's what you have.

533
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,540
 You just have people that you manage the perception

534
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,500
 that they have, and here's the tragedy in that.

535
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,540
 You'll never experience being loved

536
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,920
 because they don't actually know you.

537
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,160
 They don't know the you to love.

538
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,460
 The moment that you're willing to open up and say,

539
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,560
 this is really who I am, you allow for a real relationship

540
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,540
 and real intimacy and real love to take place.

541
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,540
 But as long as you hide behind, no, hey,

542
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,060
 I can't really share that, or I don't feel like

543
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,380
 I can be open and honest about that,

544
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,020
 you will never have the real relationships

545
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,220
 that God wants you to have, the real types of friendships

546
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,940
 that he wants you to have.

547
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,360
 It is being unknown that will make you feel alone.

548
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,140
 Some of you, the reason you feel so alone,

549
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,540
 and I hate this, and I could hammer one thing,

550
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,960
 it's because no one really knows you.

551
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,220
 You're afraid of what would happen

552
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,460
 if they actually got to know you.

553
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,700
 You're afraid of what they would think about you,

554
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,620
 and the tragedy is, here's what they're gonna think.

555
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,780
 You're actually honest with people in your life.

556
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,300
 I'm not saying everybody, you don't have to go on Facebook

557
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,540
 and be like, I gotta let everybody know

558
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,380
 about everything in my life.

559
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,060
 I'm saying having real relationships

560
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,020
 with other believers, other Christians.

561
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,900
 And if you're going, what are they gonna think about me?

562
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,700
 They're gonna think you're honest.

563
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,060
 They're gonna think you're a lot like them,

564
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,140
 only more honest.

565
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,960
 If they're a Christian.

566
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,780
 And as long as you hide behind, well,

567
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,860
 I can't really be open, you're not ever gonna have

568
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,260
 the real relationships that God wants,

569
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,340
 and you're gonna feel alone.

570
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,280
 And the God who's there doesn't want you to feel that.

571
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,820
 And one of the ways he's given you to fight that

572
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,060
 is by having real friendships, not just any friendships.

573
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,700
 The second myth, and probably the most widely held myth,

574
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,520
 is this, marriage could fix my loneliness.

575
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,100
 Marriage could fix my loneliness.

576
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,000
 Here's the truth.

577
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,420
 Marriage will address your singleness, not your loneliness.

578
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,620
 Marriage can fix your singleness,

579
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,980
 and not even fix your singleness,

580
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,740
 as though it's something to be fixed.

581
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,960
 Marriage will address your singleness.

582
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,400
 It can't touch your loneliness.

583
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,360
 Those are two entirely different things.

584
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,720
 The only thing that getting married does,

585
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,880
 if you're someone who's lonely,

586
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,520
 and I hear this all the time from people who are like,

587
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,720
 I just feel such a loneliness,

588
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,400
 you'll never understand 'cause you're married,

589
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,240
 and I just feel like I need to get married to someone.

590
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,040
 They're assuming that marriage would fix my loneliness.

591
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,840
 Marriage will change your singleness.

592
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,320
 It will not address your loneliness,

593
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,780
 because loneliness is a heart issue that only God can fix.

594
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,460
 You can be married and lonely.

595
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,140
 You can be single and not lonely.

596
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,120
 You can be single and lonely.

597
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,880
 You can be married and not lonely.

598
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,560
 Those two things are not related together.

599
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,520
 And the God who's there says

600
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,760
 he does not want you to buy the lie

601
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,820
 that marriage is meant to be some solution

602
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,940
 to the heart issues that you have.

603
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,400
 Marriage will change your singleness status,

604
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,840
 but it will not change your heart,

605
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,400
 because loneliness is a heart issue.

606
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,840
 The reality is, marriage can add to loneliness.

607
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,320
 And so, listen to me very closely.

608
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,600
 After doing this for the last 10 years,

609
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,760
 I cannot tell you how heartbroken

610
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,480
 and how often my heart has broken for the people in my life

611
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,600
 who, because they were so lonely and they thought,

612
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,320
 you know what, I just need to get married,

613
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,520
 despite the fact that, you know,

614
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,640
 he's not the best candidate,

615
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,840
 but he's the one I'm with right now,

616
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,420
 so let's make it happen, and they end up heartbroken.

617
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,880
 And the pain of loneliness in marriage

618
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,160
 far exceeds the pain of loneliness and singleness.

619
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,700
 And please, please, please,

620
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,160
 believe me, it is better to be lonely today and single

621
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,140
 than to be lonely tomorrow in marriage.

622
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,480
 And if you allow that loneliness

623
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,400
 and that void inside of your heart

624
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,440
 to lead you to get married to someone

625
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,880
 out of an attempt to kind of feel that,

626
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,880
 not only will it not fix your loneliness,

627
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,840
 it'll amplify it if you marry the wrong person.

628
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,560
 It's not dissimilar to this.

629
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,280
 Anyone go to Costco here?

630
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,120
 Shop at Costco?

631
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,200
 Okay, that's kind of like a dad thing,

632
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,720
 so there's like five of us here.

633
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,160
 And, sensor market, we'll just go with that.

634
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,280
 So for me, in this stage of life,

635
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,920
 we go to Costco all the time, like once a week,

636
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,800
 it's like, hey, we got nothing to do, we're going to Costco,

637
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,400
 'cause it's kind of like going to the zoo with kids.

638
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,160
 It's like, we'll walk around and we'll eat the samples.

639
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,800
 What I've discovered about myself

640
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:34,200
 is that I can't go to Costco when I'm hungry,

641
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,520
 because I end up going around and buying things

642
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,040
 that I don't need to buy,

643
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,680
 because I'm just like, oh man,

644
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,320
 this apple bacon sausage, this is delicious.

645
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,680
 I didn't even know that I needed this, let's get it.

646
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,640
 And then I go home and I'm like,

647
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,360
 I didn't even come here to buy this.

648
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,560
 What did we end up with all this stuff

649
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,400
 that we ended up purchasing?

650
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,760
 Because I went shopping when I was hungry

651
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,600
 and it was a bad idea.

652
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,680
 In the same way it's bad to go shopping when you're hungry,

653
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,240
 it is a bad idea to go dating when you're desperate.

654
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,440
 Yeah, whoa, whoa.

655
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,280
 (audience laughing)

656
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,560
 Ooh, ooh, man.

657
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,720
 (audience applauding)

658
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,960
 I'm, that's not just some line, that is the truth.

659
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,120
 And if you are out there and you are thirsty

660
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,880
 and you're looking to satisfy something inside of you,

661
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,520
 I'm being totally serious.

662
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,280
 If there's a part of you that out of that desperation

663
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,000
 or hey man, I just feel like lonely on the inside,

664
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,820
 so I'm gonna go looking,

665
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,660
 you're gonna end up marrying someone

666
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,280
 that is not who God says.

667
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,480
 You're gonna end up marrying someone out of that desperation

668
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,980
 and attempting to cope with that pain of just,

669
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,200
 man, I want to not be single so bad,

670
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,960
 so I don't care if they don't exactly add up to God's word.

671
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,280
 I'm moving forward with this

672
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,200
 and you are gonna find yourself more lonely

673
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,040
 than ever before.

674
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:51,200
 Marriage cannot fix your loneliness, but it can add to it.

675
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,360
 And I couldn't be more clear as a guy who's so committed

676
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,040
 to seeing amazing marriages break out all over this room.

677
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,600
 You guys, get married, make babies, make disciples,

678
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,480
 it's gonna be amazing.

679
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,880
 I hope it happens, I hope to be a part of it.

680
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,700
 And truly, there's lots of great options around this room.

681
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,680
 Lots of probably not great options too, so be careful.

682
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,200
 But point being, as someone who is so deeply committed

683
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,760
 to hoping all of you end up in amazing marriages someday,

684
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,240
 I want to be abundantly clear.

685
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,820
 You need to make sure that you address the heart issues

686
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,080
 inside of you before you go dating.

687
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,920
 Just like you need to make sure

688
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,040
 you address the hunger inside of you before you go shopping,

689
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,800
 you need to make sure that you address the heart issues

690
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,640
 so that you don't allow that desperation

691
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,040
 to push you to date someone.

692
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,020
 Who God says, this is not who you should be

693
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,080
 in relationship with.

694
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,680
 This is why the danger of marrying or dating someone

695
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,920
 who's not a follower of Jesus or not a believer,

696
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,240
 and by believer, I don't mean just they say

697
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,280
 they're a Christian, I mean they are following Jesus.

698
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,640
 This is why it's such a bad idea.

699
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,320
 Or date someone of a different religion,

700
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,360
 of a different faith.

701
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,280
 Because if you think loneliness being single,

702
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,240
 if you marry someone who doesn't share the faith

703
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,760
 that you have, you are headed for tremendous heartbreak

704
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,080
 and heartache.

705
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,700
 I mean, think about it, it's the most intimate part

706
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,540
 about you.

707
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,520
 Not only if you marry someone, if you're Christian

708
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,400
 and they're Jewish, not only does that challenge

709
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,120
 or set up lots of challenges down the road of like,

710
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,520
 oh, hey, the kids are coming to church now,

711
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,240
 then they're going to synagogue and what are we gonna do?

712
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,360
 Thought we were gonna raise them this way.

713
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,080
 It's not only logistically a nightmare,

714
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,640
 it is the most intimate part of you, your soul.

715
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,080
 And you're saying, hey, this thing that I share,

716
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,340
 this connection with God, this belief that I have,

717
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,360
 that he alone is the one that satisfies,

718
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,960
 that he died in my place, that I can know him,

719
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,100
 that I'm gonna live forever with him,

720
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,440
 that most intimate, incredible thing about you.

721
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,880
 You don't share with the person that you're married to?

722
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,400
 Think about how lonely that is.

723
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,120
 And if you know anyone who's in that spot,

724
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,000
 if they're honest, what happens is their faith either dies

725
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,960
 in that marriage or their marriage either dies.

726
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,520
 And either way, it leads to incredible loneliness.

727
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,040
 And the God who's there does not want you

728
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,100
 to experience that.

729
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,560
 Marriage will not fix your loneliness,

730
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,720
 it will address your singleness.

731
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,320
 But loneliness is a heart issue.

732
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,740
 And only Jesus can address that part of you.

733
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,640
 The best thing to do while you wait right now

734
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,420
 is to begin to work on the heart, the areas of your life

735
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,840
 where you're like, I feel like I'm looking for a solution

736
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,880
 in a man, I'm looking for a solution in a wife,

737
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,840
 I'm looking for a solution outside of Christ

738
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,640
 to fill some void, some loneliness that I have.

739
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,560
 And I think a person could fix it, and it's just a lie.

740
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:27,240
 The third and final myth is related to this idea,

741
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,560
 and it's this.

742
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,400
 Accepting Christ will fix my loneliness.

743
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,020
 Accepting Christ will fix my loneliness.

744
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,700
 Accepting Jesus as the one who came, God, became a man,

745
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,340
 he died in my place on the cross,

746
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,420
 he paid for all of my sin, everything that I've ever done

747
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,180
 in the past, everything I'll ever do in the future,

748
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:50,300
 everything that I've ever, every mistake I've ever made,

749
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,540
 it was all nailed to the cross, he paid for all of it.

750
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,860
 And then he died and he rose again, he came back alive,

751
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,420
 showing the payment was more than enough.

752
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,040
 Accepting that will not fix your loneliness.

753
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,600
 It is not accepting Christ that'll fix it,

754
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,240
 it is walking with Christ.

755
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,320
 That is the way that we battle loneliness.

756
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,640
 Accepting Christ doesn't battle loneliness,

757
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,140
 walking with him does.

758
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,640
 Any more than this.

759
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,200
 Three weeks ago, or two weeks ago, my wife and I,

760
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,040
 we joined a gym, thank you, and we're like,

761
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,760
 summer's here, this is gonna be great.

762
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,880
 Thank you, thank you, Mom, thank you for that support.

763
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,720
 It's not my mom.

764
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,720
 Okay, hey, and two weeks ago, we joined a gym,

765
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,300
 and we haven't been back to exercise yet.

766
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,200
 But we have gone to the pool like eight times.

767
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,540
 It's just become our pool.

768
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,440
 And as crazy as it would be if I stood before you

769
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,300
 and I was like, hey, here's the deal,

770
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,160
 or if I went to that gym and I was like, look,

771
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,040
 we signed up to get in shape, to get fit,

772
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,740
 we were told that if we signed up with this gym,

773
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,060
 we would get in shape.

774
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,880
 And they asked us, well, how many times have you come

775
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,060
 and used the exercise equipment?

776
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,680
 None, but that is not the point.

777
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,640
 We signed up to get in shape.

778
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,860
 They would say, what is wrong with you?

779
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,960
 And in the same way that, hey, it's not access to a gym

780
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,680
 that leads someone to be in good physical fitness,

781
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,320
 it is taking advantage of that access

782
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,800
 and putting it into action that leads that.

783
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,080
 It is not access to Christ that alone

784
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,680
 is gonna solve your loneliness.

785
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,540
 It is taking advantage of that access

786
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,820
 and walking with Jesus on a consistent basis.

787
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,020
 You cannot express that, hey, if I just accept Christ,

788
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,480
 you'll spend eternity with God in heaven.

789
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,060
 That is what the Bible teaches,

790
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,020
 that if you have true faith,

791
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,060
 if you confess with the mouth that Jesus is Lord

792
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,840
 and you believe in your heart God raised from the dead,

793
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,040
 you shall be saved.

794
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,800
 But it is not just having access

795
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,380
 to that relationship with God

796
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,520
 that's gonna allow you to battle loneliness.

797
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,460
 It is taking advantage of that access

798
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,960
 and acting on it, walking with him.

799
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,420
 Any more than I could expect to be fit

800
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,800
 by having a membership, by having access to Christ.

801
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,620
 You cannot expect to battle that loneliness

802
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,380
 without walking with him consistently.

803
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,020
 So what do I mean by walking with him?

804
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,260
 Here's some few things that I laid out

805
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,180
 as it relates to walking.

806
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,600
 One of the first things, if you wanna walk with God

807
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,920
 or walking with Christ, looks like,

808
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,300
 this is not an exhaustive list,

809
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,860
 but it at least should step you in the right direction.

810
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,580
 It involves confessing and repenting of sin.

811
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,180
 Confessing and repenting of sin.

812
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,060
 You cannot walk with God without a willingness

813
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,780
 to confess and turn from,

814
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,940
 which is what repent means, from sin.

815
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,860
 The Bible says in Matthew chapter five, verse eight,

816
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,620
 "Blessed are the pure in heart,

817
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,820
 "those who seek to purify their heart,

818
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,320
 "those whose hearts have been purified,

819
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,580
 "for they shall see God."

820
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:38,140
 In other words, the less pure of heart that you are,

821
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,620
 the more that you allow sin to infiltrate

822
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,980
 and define your heart and sit and contaminate your heart,

823
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,940
 the more that sin is present in your life,

824
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,720
 it creates a barrier of intimacy with you and God.

825
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,740
 It was this barrier, sin, being introduced

826
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,700
 that ultimately was the reason that Adam and Eve

827
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,500
 and mankind was separated from God.

828
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,740
 Anytime sin is present, it creates a barrier

829
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,360
 with a perfect, holy God.

830
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,300
 So if you continue to sin,

831
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,700
 some of you, the reason you feel so far from God

832
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,500
 is because you're addicted to pornography.

833
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,420
 And every time you close your eyes, you see nudity.

834
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,980
 You don't see a chance to pray and reflect on God.

835
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,140
 Some of you are in a relationship

836
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,640
 and God has just been so clear.

837
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,620
 Like you have like an anxiety about it.

838
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,000
 You wake up in the middle of the night sweating

839
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,840
 because you're like,

840
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,980
 "I know that I'm not supposed to be in this,

841
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,740
 "but I'm afraid of what will happen if I break up here."

842
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,100
 And it's because of a unwillingness to be obedient to him,

843
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,780
 you feel far from him and he didn't move, you did.

844
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,460
 And the God who says, "Will you confess, repent of sin,

845
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,700
 "will you confess, acknowledge it to God,

846
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,700
 "acknowledge it to him?"

847
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,840
 And in doing so, you have a step in the right direction

848
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,820
 of intimacy being restored with God.

849
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,460
 Walking with him means just confessing,

850
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,020
 acknowledging all of us, we're not perfect people.

851
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,740
 We need a savior.

852
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,100
 And so I can confess and repent and turn from that.

853
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,140
 Second part of walking with him,

854
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,780
 the second thing I included here

855
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,280
 is that a constant communication with him or praying to him.

856
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,460
 What does it look like to walk with God?

857
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,660
 Like, "Hey, what is it gonna mean

858
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,320
 "if I actually wanna battle loneliness,

859
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,020
 "not accepting but walking with him?"

860
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,380
 It means I'm gonna confess and repent of sin.

861
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,300
 When I see it in my life, when people point it out

862
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,900
 in my life, it means I'm gonna be

863
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,340
 in constant communication with you, God.

864
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,240
 God doesn't want some relationship with you

865
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,300
 that you see him as either the bell service

866
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,740
 or as the 911 call, but as a constant walkie-talkie,

867
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,220
 that he wants a relationship.

868
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:33,540
 Verse seven says, "Cast all of your cares on God

869
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,460
 "because he cares for you."

870
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,660
 I want you to think about this verse.

871
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,660
 Everything you care about, he wants you to bring that to him.

872
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,420
 Like, not just like, "Hey, God, I'm praying today

873
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,660
 "and thank you for this food

874
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,860
 "and I wanna pray for all the orphans in Africa

875
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,700
 "and I wanna pray for sick Aunt Betty."

876
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,220
 Everything you care about, your anxiety about work,

877
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,620
 your concern about your friend,

878
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,700
 your anxiety about what your boss may think of you,

879
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,280
 the presentation you have coming up,

880
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,100
 you hope that you get green lights on the way to work.

881
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,060
 I don't know if you just pray for that or not,

882
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,980
 but I know that he wants you to pray,

883
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,860
 and as you do so, he'll align your will to his.

884
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,220
 But he doesn't want you to hide back and say,

885
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,120
 "I can only bring things to him

886
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,920
 "that I can read a verse exactly for this in here

887
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,340
 "of what exactly I'm gonna pray for."

888
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,940
 He wants a relationship where you bring everything to him.

889
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,640
 God, I'm feeling lonely right now.

890
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,460
 God, I just wanna be married.

891
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,540
 I don't know how I'm gonna make ends meet financially.

892
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,420
 My roommate's moving out and I don't have an option

893
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,340
 of where I'm gonna live, and I'm anxious about it.

894
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,620
 Will you provide a roommate for me?

895
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,820
 Will you help me not be anxious?

896
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,060
 Everything that you feel, I mean, think about that verse.

897
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,460
 Some of you, you need to hear this

898
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,780
 more than anything else I'm gonna say,

899
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,600
 'cause anxiety is a part of your story,

900
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,820
 it's a part of your present.

901
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,680
 And God says, "I care about everything you care about."

902
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,200
 That's what the verse says.

903
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
 Cast everything, I think they have it on the screens,

904
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,080
 cast all of your anxieties on him because he cares for you.

905
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,600
 Or your translation has, cast all of your cares on him

906
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,180
 because he cares for you.

907
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,200
 Everything you care about, he cares about,

908
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,080
 because he cares about you,

909
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,360
 and he wants you to bring those things to him.

910
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,080
 Constant communication, not as a bellhop

911
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,480
 or as a room service, like, "Hey, can I get this

912
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,360
 "one thing here or 911 only when I'm afraid

913
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,660
 "is she pregnant that I'm praying?"

914
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,420
 But a constant communication to God.

915
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,260
 He wants to have with you.

916
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,220
 The third thing as it relates to just walking with him,

917
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,600
 and you'll be amazed what happens whenever you do that.

918
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,060
 Whenever you begin to actually pray with him,

919
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,640
 your awareness, it's like my awareness of his nearness

920
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,240
 and his presence over my life is raised.

921
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,660
 It's like my awareness of how much he cares about me

922
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,320
 and he cares about the things and my circumstances

923
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,620
 is raised just by praying more.

924
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,220
 God, will you help me right now?

925
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,380
 I'm about to walk up here and share,

926
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,260
 will you help me to be clear?

927
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,940
 Will you help me to get over what people think about me?

928
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,780
 Will you help me?

929
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,820
 Whatever those things are in your life,

930
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,940
 he wants you to bring them to him.

931
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,780
 The third thing,

932
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,580
 the component of walking with Christ

933
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,180
 involves trusting and obeying.

934
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,340
 I'm gonna trust you and obey.

935
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,980
 I'm gonna follow what your word says in here.

936
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,100
 I'm gonna walk by faith is another way of saying that.

937
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,460
 I'm gonna trust what you say is right,

938
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,260
 and I'm gonna do it.

939
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,020
 Romans chapter 12 verse two says,

940
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,020
 do not conform to the patterns of this world.

941
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,060
 The behavior of the world,

942
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,220
 don't conform to what everybody else is doing out there.

943
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,620
 If everybody's doing it,

944
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,900
 it's probably not the behavior that should mark you.

945
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,060
 If it's the behavior or the way of thinking

946
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,140
 that the world has,

947
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,840
 if it's like this is the common way that people think today,

948
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,460
 it's probably not the right one for you.

949
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,780
 Do not conform to the pattern or the ways of this world,

950
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,940
 but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

951
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,520
 That's reading God's word

952
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,480
 and allowing the truth of what it says to transform you,

953
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,320
 not be conformed into what the world tells you should be.

954
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,920
 Then you will be able to test when you know

955
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,720
 what God's will is, which is what the Bible is.

956
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,560
 When you know what it is,

957
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,720
 then you'll be able to put it to the test.

958
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,560
 When you know what he says about sex,

959
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,600
 when you know what he says about,

960
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,800
 hey, flee sexual morality,

961
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,480
 don't allow that to be a part of your relationship,

962
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,340
 hey, that is a thing safe for marriage.

963
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,360
 Whenever you actually do that,

964
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,760
 and you're like, dude, people actually do that,

965
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,960
 and you're like, hey, you know what, I'm gonna try it.

966
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,800
 Whenever you do it,

967
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,040
 the Bible says, then you'll be able to put it to the test,

968
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,080
 and you will approve what God's will is,

969
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,720
 as good, pleasing, and perfect will.

970
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,360
 It's like whenever you begin to put it to the test,

971
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,560
 you're like, oh, well, I guess I'll really try this.

972
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,180
 It's as though the Bible's saying, hey, test me.

973
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,400
 You're not gonna end up being like,

974
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,840
 gosh, I got buyer's remorse here.

975
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,840
 I cannot believe I dated the way God says to date.

976
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,840
 I really regret my decision there.

977
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,880
 No one does it, Paul says.

978
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,240
 You begin to walk according to the ways

979
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,300
 that God says to walk,

980
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,120
 as it relates to your relationship with other people,

981
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,600
 as it relates to the way you use your time,

982
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,520
 your money, your job, the way that you think.

983
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,380
 Alcohol, sexuality, he's like, hey, do what I say.

984
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,420
 Put it to the test.

985
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,220
 You have a money-back guarantee.

986
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,460
 It works, and you will find, Paul says,

987
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,380
 you'll be able to test it, and you will approve it,

988
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,880
 because it is good, pleasing, and perfect.

989
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,320
 And you know what happens whenever that happens?

990
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,160
 When you begin to actually say,

991
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,160
 like, man, I'm gonna begin to take steps,

992
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,340
 and I'm gonna trust you, God.

993
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,000
 This is how you think I should handle this situation.

994
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,760
 I'm gonna trust you, and I'm gonna actually do it.

995
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,680
 Your faith will begin to grow.

996
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,000
 Faith is like a muscle.

997
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,580
 The more that you exercise it, the stronger it gets.

998
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,600
 And the same, and the inverse is true.

999
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,600
 The less that you exercise it, the weaker it gets.

1000
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,480
 A muscle atrophies.

1001
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,160
 If you don't use it, it's like, that's going away.

1002
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,360
 If you use it, it's gonna get stronger and stronger,

1003
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,180
 and grow.

1004
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,220
 This is how faith works.

1005
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,820
 This is why some people can walk through

1006
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,040
 the valley of the shadow of the most painful things,

1007
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,800
 and they're like, unshakably fixed on God.

1008
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,840
 Because over their life, they've said,

1009
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,380
 I'm gonna trust you, and I've seen him show up

1010
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,160
 over and over, I've seen his ways.

1011
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,960
 They're higher than my ways, but they're better,

1012
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,800
 and I can trust him.

1013
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,240
 And then there's other people,

1014
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,400
 who slowly by slowly, they begin to step away from God.

1015
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,420
 Maybe they step into some type of sexual relationship

1016
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,260
 they shouldn't be a part of.

1017
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,720
 Maybe they step through, maybe they just step through

1018
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,680
 apathy, they're like, hey, dude, I'm gonna get back

1019
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,840
 to being serious about my faith when I'm in my 30s,

1020
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,680
 and kind of like, become more of an adult.

1021
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,120
 I'll get serious about that then,

1022
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,680
 'cause I'm really working on my career.

1023
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,840
 And they just slowly begin to step away from God.

1024
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,280
 And it's not overnight, like, hey, I'm outta here, deuces.

1025
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,520
 They just drift away.

1026
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,080
 And they wake up one day, and they're like,

1027
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,380
 I don't even know if this whole thing is true.

1028
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:15,840
 Because their faith was never exercised,

1029
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,340
 and it weakened, just like a muscle.

1030
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,200
 If you haven't used your legs since high school,

1031
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,640
 men, which many of you haven't in terms of exercising,

1032
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,220
 they're going to just atrophy and atrophy away.

1033
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,960
 This is how faith works.

1034
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,300
 If you don't use it, you don't lose it in an internal sense,

1035
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,680
 but it's not growing, it weakens over time.

1036
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,800
 And the Bible says, if you walk with God,

1037
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,800
 your faith, begin to trust him,

1038
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,600
 and it will grow your trust every single time.

1039
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,080
 Become more convinced, his way is true,

1040
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,600
 his way is true, I can trust him.

1041
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,440
 So walking with God includes confessing and repenting,

1042
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,440
 praying constantly, or constant communication,

1043
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,160
 and trusting and obeying him.

1044
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,680
 Here's what, let me be very practical,

1045
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,000
 'cause we're about to wrap it up.

1046
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,160
 If you're in the room, or you're listening right now,

1047
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,060
 and you wanna know, what do I do when I'm lonely?

1048
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,320
 Like in that moment when it just kind of reaches

1049
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,400
 and washes over me, and I feel alone,

1050
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,160
 I feel abandoned, I feel like no one is there,

1051
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,520
 what do I do, very specifically in that moment?

1052
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,220
 You go to God, and you go to God's people.

1053
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,140
 You go to God in prayer, and you say, God, I feel alone.

1054
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:30,260
 I feel like there's no one who cares about me.

1055
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,360
 I don't even feel like you're near to me.

1056
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,540
 I don't even know that praying to you will help me.

1057
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,480
 You're honest, and you go to him.

1058
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,680
 And you cry out to him, and you call out to God's people.

1059
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,600
 You reach out to other believers in your life,

1060
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,160
 this is why we hammer having a community group,

1061
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,400
 in your life that can care for you,

1062
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,680
 that in the midst of walking through loneliness,

1063
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,200
 you can reach out and say, I feel lonely right now.

1064
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,400
 I'm battling with lies, and I need someone,

1065
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,880
 will you pray for me?

1066
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,120
 Will you come, just, can we hang out, can we talk,

1067
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,040
 can we go on a walk right now?

1068
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,080
 I need someone in my life, and someone that you can be

1069
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,540
 in their life, for in those moments

1070
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,960
 where they feel loneliness grabbing ahold of their heart,

1071
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,200
 you reach out to God's people, and to God.

1072
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,120
 You go to him in prayer, and you reach out to his people.

1073
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,720
 This is the way that we battle against loneliness.

1074
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,380
 And the reason I've intentionally said battle,

1075
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,820
 and not fix loneliness, is because in this life,

1076
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,880
 in this world, because of sin entering,

1077
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,680
 there's a loneliness that can be of a good thing,

1078
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,960
 because it's a reminder of the fact

1079
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,680
 that we have been separated from God.

1080
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,200
 And if you're a Christian, you have been restored,

1081
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,760
 and are being reconciled to him,

1082
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,720
 but ultimately, it's a reminder for any of us,

1083
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,120
 for all of us, that one day, that loneliness,

1084
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,480
 that pain will be no more.

1085
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,280
 It is going away, for those of you who are Christians.

1086
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,540
 And there's coming a day where you will be home,

1087
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,040
 and that loneliness, that sometimes,

1088
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,800
 the reason it feels like I'm homesick,

1089
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,380
 is because you're homesick.

1090
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,520
 And there's gonna come a day in eternity

1091
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,920
 where you're going home, and it will be no more.

1092
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,960
 For others of you, you've never had a moment

1093
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,920
 where you've actually trusted in Jesus.

1094
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:13,400
 And the scary thing is that, apart from you having Christ

1095
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,740
 as the payment for your sins,

1096
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,200
 you're gonna spend eternity alone,

1097
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,200
 away from God, separated fully and finally from him.

1098
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,440
 And he doesn't want you to.

1099
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,760
 He's crazy in love with you.

1100
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,600
 He made that abundantly clear 2,000 years ago

1101
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,600
 when he reset the calendar, and he died in your place.

1102
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,420
 The reason I say eternally alone is,

1103
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,920
 it's been described that hell

1104
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,460
 is being totally separated and cut off.

1105
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,680
 It's totally separated and cut off.

1106
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,600
 I mean, in some ways, hell is just eternal loneliness.

1107
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,440
 Think about it.

1108
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,980
 Every good and perfect gift, James chapter one says,

1109
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,700
 comes from the father of lights, who above.

1110
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,480
 Basically, he's saying God.

1111
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,940
 Every good and perfect thing comes from God.

1112
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,580
 Every good thing comes from him.

1113
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,640
 If you are cut off, then hell is a separation from God.

1114
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,760
 There's nothing good there.

1115
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,340
 You're not taking shots of Patron

1116
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,820
 with your buddy in the devil.

1117
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,980
 You're not hanging out with friends,

1118
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,180
 like, kind of like, oh, this is so good,

1119
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,100
 let's rehash that one time at the frat party.

1120
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,020
 You're not doing any of that.

1121
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,940
 You are cut off from humanity.

1122
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,040
 You're cut off from God.

1123
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,340
 You're cut off from relationships,

1124
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,660
 'cause those are good things.

1125
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,920
 You are totally separated,

1126
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,180
 eternally lonely, and you don't have to be,

1127
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,500
 because Jesus came to this earth

1128
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,340
 and he went through eternal loneliness in your place

1129
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,280
 so that you wouldn't have to be eternally lonely.

1130
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,380
 He went through eternal loneliness.

1131
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,520
 What do I mean by that?

1132
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,400
 Maybe you've heard this before.

1133
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,320
 You don't understand.

1134
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,620
 When Jesus died on the cross,

1135
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,020
 it wasn't just the crucifixion and nails were painful

1136
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,240
 and death sucks.

1137
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,060
 It wasn't just like, oh, that had to be a rough day.

1138
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,580
 It was that plus the fact that he was separated

1139
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,140
 from his Father.

1140
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,400
 God the Father was separated from Christ the Son,

1141
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,140
 and it says that Jesus even cried out.

1142
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,300
 It was though Jesus felt abandoned,

1143
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
 because the weight of all that sin

1144
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,580
 pushed him away from the Father.

1145
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,220
 He took all of the sin of humanity

1146
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,580
 and it created separation

1147
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:04,940
 between the Son and the Father.

1148
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,860
 In Matthew chapter 27, he's on the cross,

1149
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,540
 and one of his last statements on the cross,

1150
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,060
 he cries out and he's experiencing separation

1151
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,300
 from his Father like he has never felt before,

1152
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,700
 and he quotes Psalm 22, and he says,

1153
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,600
 "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?"

1154
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:26,460
 And the answer was that he abandoned him

1155
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,860
 and allowed him to experience eternal loneliness

1156
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,260
 as he was crucified on that cross

1157
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,060
 so that you wouldn't have to forever,

1158
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,780
 because he loves you.

1159
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,940
 And that ache in your heart,

1160
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,420
 if there's anything good about loneliness,

1161
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,500
 is that it points us and reminds us that you're not home.

1162
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,820
 There's something that no human can satisfy,

1163
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,820
 no substance can satisfy, no money can satisfy,

1164
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,900
 and if you don't believe that,

1165
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,660
 live long enough and you'll see it.

1166
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,540
 And no matter how long you live,

1167
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,800
 one day you will see it,

1168
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:03,380
 either as you experience eternal satisfaction

1169
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,180
 'cause you're home, or eternal regret

1170
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,220
 because you're not and you never will be.

1171
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,460
 The solution for loneliness is not more friends,

1172
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,980
 it's the right friends.

1173
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,080
 Marriage cannot fix your loneliness.

1174
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,340
 Only Jesus can do that,

1175
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,500
 and it is walking with him every single day

1176
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:24,120
 as a solution for how we fight and battle loneliness.

1177
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:30,260
 I think when I think about just feeling alone,

1178
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:34,600
 I'm reminded of times in my life

1179
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,440
 where I just felt like,

1180
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,020
 dude, nobody is actually following God.

1181
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,020
 Like no one's actually trying to live this way,

1182
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,140
 there's so few people.

1183
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,820
 Like God, the world is so crazy,

1184
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,940
 it's going to hell in a handbasket, literally,

1185
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,700
 and the number of people that are like,

1186
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,760
 hey, I'm all in with Jesus,

1187
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,220
 I wanna seek to do his will,

1188
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,620
 I wanna seek to walk with him,

1189
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,520
 though none go with me, I will follow.

1190
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,180
 It's like there's just no people like that.

1191
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,540
 Like I remember at different stages,

1192
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,980
 I remember sitting down with pastors being like,

1193
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,460
 dude, I just feel like,

1194
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,260
 if this is what God wants,

1195
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,500
 there's like 20 Christians on the planet,

1196
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,260
 and this is what I guess my lot is,

1197
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,860
 I'm gonna have to be friends with these homeschool kids

1198
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,700
 that smell funny,

1199
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,980
 and there's not a single attractive Christian girl anywhere,

1200
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,860
 and so I guess I gotta marry Mother Teresa and woo a nun,

1201
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,640
 and is that what God has for me?

1202
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,060
 And more than that,

1203
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,620
 just like, it just feels alone.

1204
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,580
 Like no one's actually trying to date this way,

1205
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,780
 trying to live this way.

1206
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,300
 And it's just not true.

1207
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,380
 And so if you're here tonight,

1208
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,660
 and you are, someone who's ever felt that,

1209
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,060
 or wondered that, or thought that before,

1210
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,580
 I want you to know it's just not true.

1211
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,480
 In fact, all over, not just in this place,

1212
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,520
 all over even right now, listening, wherever you are,

1213
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,060
 there's people, and men and women gathered together

1214
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,300
 who are worshiping in different locations,

1215
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,740
 and they share the same faith as you,

1216
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,460
 the same kindred spirit if you're a follower of Jesus,

1217
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:55,160
 and they're seeking to live their lives, not perfectly,

1218
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,940
 but with the one true God,

1219
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,820
 and in relationship with his people.

1220
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,540
 And they're not just in Dallas, Texas,

1221
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,860
 they're over there in Fort Worth, Texas,

1222
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,380
 like here's gatherings that are taking place right now,

1223
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,220
 just so you don't,

1224
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,260
 you're like, dude, it's just alone.

1225
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,100
 Here's in Fort Worth, Texas,

1226
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,260
 here's in Northwest Arkansas, in Fayetteville,

1227
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,100
 these are gatherings of other ports and locations

1228
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:13,940
 that are taking place.

1229
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,740
 This is Houston, you can go back to Houston,

1230
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:18,820
 okay or not, there we go.

1231
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,940
 Houston, Texas, gathering in the chapel,

1232
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,380
 H-Town, we know you, that's my hood, go to Tulsa,

1233
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,700
 Tulsa, go to the next one, Billy,

1234
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,100
 El Paso, Texas, where people are gathering together,

1235
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,160
 get excited, El Porche, next one,

1236
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,480
 the Woodlands, Texas,

1237
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,180
 Phoenix, Arizona,

1238
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,760
 Austin, Texas,

1239
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,060
 Cincinnati, Ohio, Cedar Rapids, Iowa,

1240
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,300
 Corsicana, Nashville, Tennessee,

1241
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,580
 there's four other different places

1242
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,140
 that we didn't even capture up there,

1243
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,900
 and I just want you to know you're not alone,

1244
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,660
 and here's the deal,

1245
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,300
 the way that God is working in our world

1246
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,460
 is far beyond anything with the different locations

1247
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,180
 of young adults gathered, listening right now,

1248
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,660
 listening all over the country,

1249
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,500
 it far exceeds everything.

1250
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,900
 That he's got people, he's got his people

1251
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,860
 all over the place, men and women, just like you,

1252
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,820
 who are seeking to follow him imperfectly,

1253
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,200
 but they're striving that, hey, I wanna be

1254
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,540
 who God calls me to be, I wanna live the abundant life

1255
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,780
 and experience eternal life forever, you are not alone.

1256
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,900
 He's got men and women right now that are praying to him

1257
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,160
 in Mandarin Chinese, in Farsi, in French, in Spanish,

1258
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,380
 his people are everywhere, you are not alone,

1259
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,060
 and the God who's there doesn't want you to feel alone

1260
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:26,340
 and to experience loneliness

1261
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,900
 in this life or in the next,

1262
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,980
 and he has made clear how to battle in this one

1263
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,860
 and how he has already won the battle for the next.

1264
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,860
 The choice is yours and mine to accept it.

1265
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,580
 Let me pray.

1266
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:49,660
 Father, I pray for every lonely heart right now in this room

1267
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:58,440
 that you who know them, who know everything about them,

1268
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,340
 you know the circumstances they feel,

1269
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,980
 the anxieties that weigh on them,

1270
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,160
 the future that's in store for them,

1271
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,800
 the hairs on their head, you know the number of them,

1272
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:13,080
 that you would break through the walls of loneliness now,

1273
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,620
 you would be bigger than the pain of loneliness now,

1274
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:20,280
 you would move them to step in the direction

1275
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,200
 of your people tonight,

1276
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:27,280
 and you would help us to fight,

1277
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,220
 and you would win the battle for loneliness

1278
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,280
 in our heart tomorrow and day by day.

1279
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,200
 I pray for anyone in this room

1280
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,760
 who's never put their faith in Christ,

1281
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,720
 tonight would be their night,

1282
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,580
 that they would know that there's a way that you have made

1283
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:42,280
 so that they don't have to be eternally lonely forever,

1284
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,480
 because you faced an eternal loneliness

1285
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,040
 and abandonment for us.

1286
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,560
 Thank you, God, we are unworthy of your love,

1287
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,060
 of your sacrifice.

1288
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,760
 I pray that anyone who's never had a moment

1289
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,200
 where they've trusted, tonight would be their night,

1290
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,720
 and they would experience victory and loneliness

1291
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,200
 in this life and forever in the life to come.

1292
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,960
 We worship you now in song, amen.

1293
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:17,960
